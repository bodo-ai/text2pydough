We need to list the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. This means we need to:
1. Access the `nations` collection
2. For each nation, count the number of customers
3. For each nation, count the number of suppliers
4. Order the results by nation name

From the database structure reference, we can see that:
- Each nation has a `customers` property which is a list of customers in that nation
- Each nation has a `suppliers` property which is a list of suppliers in that nation

To do this:
1. We can use the `COUNT` function to count the number of customers and suppliers for each nation
2. We'll use `CALCULATE` to create new fields for the customer and supplier counts
3. Then we'll order the results by nation name using `ORDER_BY`

```python
nation_counts = nations.CALCULATE(

2.  **Navigate to the `customers` for each nation.** We need to consider orders placed by customers of each nation.
3.  **Filter the `orders` to include only those placed in 1995.** We'll use the `YEAR(order_date) == 1995` condition within a `WHERE` clause.

Explanation:

*   We start with the `nations` collection.
*   We use `CALCULATE` to create two fields: `nation_name` (the name of the nation) and `order_count`.
*   `order_count` is calculated by counting the orders placed by customers of each nation, filtering for orders in 1995 using `WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`.

Explanation:

*   We start with the `regions` collection because we want to find the region with the highest total order value.
*   We use `CALCULATE` to create a new collection with the `region_name` and `total_order_value`.

**Reasoning:**

The error message ""Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'lines' in graph 'TPCH': 'order_date'"" indicates that the `order_date` field is being accessed from the `lines` collection, but it actually belongs to the `orders` collection. The `lines` collection does not have direct access to `order_date`.

To fix this, we need to correctly reference the `order_date` field through the `orders` collection, which is related to the `lines` collection. Therefore, the corrected code accesses `order_date` via `orders.order_date` within the `WHERE` clause. This ensures that the year is extracted from the correct date field associated with each order.

The `customer.mktsegment` and `order_data.order_year` are used to filter the data. The `customer_key` is added to be used later.
3.  **Partition by market segment and calculate the total sold for each part:** The `PARTITION` function groups the data by market segment and part name, and the `CALCULATE` function calculates the total sold for each part within each segment.
4.  **Rank parts within each segment and filter top 20:** The `RANKING` function ranks the parts within each segment based on their total sold, and the `WHERE` function filters the results to retrieve only the top 20 most popular parts per market segment. The `ORDER_BY` function sorts the results by market segment and total sold. The partition is done by market segment, and the `SUM` function is used to calculate the total sold for each part within each segment.

Explanation:

1.  **Calculate Total Sales:**
    *   We start with the `TPCH.regions` collection and calculate the `region_name`.
    *   Then, we navigate to `nations.suppliers` to access suppliers within each region.
    *   We calculate `supplier_name`, `region_name` and `total_sales` (SUM(lines.extended\_price \* lines.quantity)) for each supplier.
2.  **Rank Suppliers within each Region:**
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to add a `supplier_rank` field.
    *   The `RANKING` function is used to rank suppliers within each region (`levels=1`) based on their `total_sales` in descending order (`by=total_sales.DESC()`).
3.  **Filter Top 3:**
    *   We use `WHERE(supplier_rank <= 3)` to filter and keep only the top 3 suppliers in each region based on their calculated rank.
4.  **Output:**
    *   The final result `ranked_suppliers` contains the `region_name`, `supplier_name`, `total_sales`, and `supplier_rank` for the top 3 suppliers in each region.

Explanation:

1.  We start with the `nations` collection and filter it to only include nations where the `region.name` is ""EUROPE"".
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to create three fields:
    *   `nation_name`: The name of the nation.
    *   `num_customers`: The total number of customers in that nation.
    *   `num_orders_1995`: The number of orders placed by customers in that nation in 1995. We achieve this by accessing the `customers.orders` sub-collection and filtering the orders by `YEAR(order_date) == 1995` before counting them.

Explanation:

*   We use `CALCULATE` to create three new fields: `customer_name`, `orders_1995`, and `orders_1994`.
    *   `customer_name` stores the name of the customer.

Which is the average order value per Nation? List the nation name and average order value.

The user wants to partition the `nations` collection by `name` and then calculate the average order value for each nation. The average order value is defined as `AVG(extended_price * quantity)`.

Here's the problem: `nations` does not have direct access to `extended_price` or `quantity`. These fields are in the `lines` collection, which is related to `orders`. We need to traverse the relationships to calculate the average order value for each nation.

Here's the path we need to take: `nations` -> `customers` -> `orders` -> `lines`.

Since we need to use `extended_price` and `quantity` from the `lines` collection, we cannot directly partition the `nations` collection. We need to perform the calculation at the `lines` level and then aggregate up to the `nations` level.

Here's the approach:

1.  Calculate the total price for each line item (`extended_price * quantity`).
2.  Associate each line item with its nation through the `lines` -> `order` -> `customer` -> `nation` path.
3.  Partition by nation name and calculate the average of the total price.

```python
line_item_values = lines.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=order.customer.nation.name,
    total_price=extended_price * quantity
)

average_order_values = PARTITION(line_item_values, name=""line_items"", by=nation_name).CALCULATE(
    nation_name=nation_name,
    average_order_value=AVG(line_items.total_price)
)

Explanation:

1.  `line_item_values = lines.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the `total_price` for each line item and associates it with the `nation_name` through the relationships.
2.  `PARTITION(line_item_values, name=""line_items"", by=nation_name)`: This partitions the `line_item_values` collection by `nation_name`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the average order value for each nation using the `AVG` function.

Explanation:

1.  **Corrected `lines` reference**: The original code had an error because `lines` was not called from the high-level graph `TPCH`. The corrected code starts with `TPCH.lines` to properly reference the `lines` collection.
2.  **Accessing region key**: To access the region key, the code now uses `supplier.nation.region.key` and `order.customer.nation.region.key` to navigate through the relationships and get the correct key.
3.  **Corrected `TOP_K` and `SINGULAR` usage**: The `TOP_K` function returns a collection, so to get the `part_type`, it's necessary to use `.SINGULAR().part_type` to extract the value.
4.  **Accessing region name**: To access the region name, the code now uses `TPCH.regions.WHERE(key == supplier_region_key).SINGULAR().name` to properly reference the regions collection and extract the name.
5.  **Removed unnecessary `part_type` in `part_type_counts`**: The `part_type` was redundant in the `CALCULATE` function within the `part_type_counts` partition, so it was removed.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`country_codes = (""13"", ""23"", ""29"", ""30"", ""18"", ""17"")`**: Defines a tuple containing the allowed country codes.

2.  **`customers_with_country_code = customers.WHERE(ISIN(phone[:2], country_codes))`**: Filters the `customers` collection to include only those whose phone number starts with one of the specified country codes.

3.  **`avg_acctbal = customers_with_country_code.CALCULATE(avg_acctbal=RELAVG(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0))).SINGULAR().avg_acctbal`**: Calculates the average account balance for customers with the specified country codes, considering only positive account balances. The `RELAVG` function calculates the average of the account balances, and `KEEP_IF` ensures that only positive account balances are included in the average. The `.SINGULAR().avg_acctbal` part extracts the calculated average account balance from the single-row collection created by the `CALCULATE` function. The error `Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'customers' in graph 'TPCH'` occurred because `TPCH` was used to calculate the average, but `TPCH` is only used for performing calculations, such as average, sum, count, etc. The average should be calculated from the `customers_with_country_code` collection.

4.  **`customers_no_orders_above_avg = customers_with_country_code.WHERE((HASNOT(orders) == 1) & (acctbal > avg_acctbal))`**: Filters the `customers_with_country_code` collection to include only those who have not placed any orders (`HASNOT(orders) == 1`) and whose account balance is above the calculated average.

5.  **`country_code_groups = PARTITION(customers_no_orders_above_avg, name=""cust_group"", by=(phone[:2])).CALCULATE(...)`**: Partitions the filtered customers by the country code extracted from their phone number. Then, for each country code:

    *   **`country_code=phone[:2]`**: Selects the country code.
    *   **`num_customers=COUNT(cust_group)`**: Counts the number of customers.
    *   **`total_balance=SUM(cust_group.acctbal)`**: Calculates the total account balance.

Explanation:

1.  We start with the `customers` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to derive the following fields:
    *   `customer_key`: The customer's key.
    *   `customer_name`: The customer's name.
    *   `total_spent`: The sum of `total_price` for all orders placed by the customer.
    *   `ordered_1996`: A boolean indicating whether the customer placed any orders in 1996.
    *   `ordered_1997`: A boolean indicating whether the customer placed any orders in 1997.
    *   `last_order_date`: The date of the customer's most recent order.
3.  We use `WHERE` to filter the customers based on the following conditions:
    *   `total_spent > 1000`: The customer's total spending is greater than $1000.
    *   `ordered_1996 == True`: The customer placed orders in 1996.
    *   `ordered_1997 == False`: The customer did not place orders in 1997.
4.  We use `CALCULATE` again to derive the `months_since_last_order` field, which calculates the number of months between the `last_order_date` and the current date using `DATEDIFF`.
5.  Finally, we use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results in descending order of `total_spent`.

**Explanation:**

The error 'PyDough does yet support aggregations whose arguments mix between subcollection data of the current context and fields of the context itself' arises because the original code attempts to directly aggregate fields (`extended_price`, `tax`, `discount`) within the `SUM` function while also referencing sub-collections.

To resolve this, I performed the following steps:

1.  **Calculate intermediate values:** I introduced a `CALCULATE` step to compute `total_amount` (extended\_price \* (1 - discount)) and `total_tax` for each line item *before* aggregation. This ensures that the aggregation functions only operate on pre-calculated singular values.
2.  **Aggregate pre-calculated values:** In the subsequent `CALCULATE` step, I used `SUM` to aggregate the `total_amount` and `total_tax` across the filtered lines.
3.  **Calculate SPM:** Finally, I calculated the SPM using the aggregated values. I renamed `total_tax` to `total_tax_amount` to avoid confusion.

This approach adheres to PyDough's requirement of using singular expressions within aggregation functions and avoids mixing sub-collection data with context fields.
