**Understanding the Requirements**

The goal is to find customers in Europe who meet specific criteria:

1.  **Location:**  Must be in Europe.
2.  **Account Balance:**  Must have an account balance greater than $700.
3.  **Order Activity:**  Must have placed at least one order in 1995.
4.  **Output:**  We need the customer's name and the number of orders they placed in 1995.
5.  **Sorting:**  The results should be sorted in descending order based on the number of orders.

**Database Relationships**

*   `customers` collection has customer information, including `acctbal`, `name`, and `nation_key`.
*   `nations` collection links customers to nations and has a `region_key`.
*   `regions` collection has region information, including the `name` (e.g., ""EUROPE"").
*   `orders` collection is linked to customers and has `order_date`.

**PyDough Code Construction**

Here's the PyDough code to achieve this:

```python
european_customers_1995 = regions.WHERE(name == ""EUROPE"").nations.customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_orders=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).WHERE((acctbal > 700) & (num_orders > 0)).ORDER_BY(num_orders.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`regions.WHERE(name == ""EUROPE"")`**:  Start with the `regions` collection and filter for the region named ""EUROPE"".
2.  **`.nations.customers`**:  Navigate from the ""EUROPE"" region to its associated nations and then to the customers in those nations.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:  Calculate the following for each customer:
    *   `customer_name=name`: Select the customer's name.
    *   `num_orders=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: Count the number of orders placed by the customer in 1995.
4.  **`.WHERE((acctbal > 700) & (num_orders > 0))`**:  Filter the customers based on the following conditions:
    *   `acctbal > 700`:  Account balance greater than $700.
    *   `num_orders > 0`:  At least one order placed in 1995.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(num_orders.DESC())`**:  Sort the results in descending order based on the `num_orders` (number of orders).

1.  Calculate the total sales for each supplier within each region. Total sales is defined as `extended_price * quantity`.
2.  Rank the suppliers within each region based on their total sales.
3.  Select the top 3 suppliers from each region based on their rank.
4.  Display the region name, supplier name, and total sales for these top suppliers.

Here's the PyDough code to achieve this:

    supplier_name=name,
    region_name=region_name,

).WHERE(supplier_rank <= 3)
```

Explanation:

1.  `region_supplier_sales`: This calculates the total sales for each supplier within each region.
    *   It starts with the `regions` collection and calculates the `region_name`.
    *   Then, it navigates to the `nations` and then to the `suppliers` sub-collections.
    *   It calculates the `supplier_name`, `region_name`, and `total_sales` (sum of `extended_price * quantity` from the `lines` collection).
2.  `ranked_suppliers`: This ranks the suppliers within each region based on their total sales and filters for the top 3.
    *   It takes the `region_supplier_sales` collection and calculates the `region_name`, `supplier_name`, and `total_sales`.
    *   It uses the `RANKING` function to assign a rank to each supplier within each region based on their `total_sales` in descending order (`total_sales.DESC()`). The `levels=2` argument ensures that the ranking is done within each region.
    *   Finally, it filters the results using `WHERE(supplier_rank <= 3)` to select only the top 3 suppliers from each region.

1.  Filter for European countries.
2.  For each European country, count the number of customers.
3.  For each European country, count the number of orders placed in 1995, including customers who didn't place any orders that year.

Explanation:

1.  `nations.WHERE(region.name == ""EUROPE"")`: This filters the `nations` collection to include only nations in the ""EUROPE"" region.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the required fields for each European nation.
    *   `nation_name=name`: This selects the name of the nation.

It first calculates the number of orders placed in 1995 for each customer using `customers.CALCULATE(num_orders=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)))` and then sums these counts for all customers in the nation using `SUM(...)`. This ensures that customers who didn't place any orders in 1995 are also included in the customer count.

We need to find customers who placed more orders in 1995 than in 1994. Here's how we can approach this:

1.  **Access the `customers` collection.**

).WHERE(orders_1995 > orders_1994).CALCULATE(customer_name=customer_name)
```

Explanation:

*   We start with the `customers` collection.
*   We use `CALCULATE` to create three new fields: `customer_name` (to store the customer's name), `orders_1995` (to store the number of orders in 1995), and `orders_1994` (to store the number of orders in 1994).
*   `COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))` counts the number of orders placed by each customer in 1995.
*   `COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994))` counts the number of orders placed by each customer in 1994.
*   We use `WHERE(orders_1995 > orders_1994)` to filter for customers where the number of orders in 1995 is greater than the number of orders in 1994.
*   Finally, we use `CALCULATE(customer_name=customer_name)` to select only the customer's name for the final result.

Which is the average order value per Nation? List the nation name and average order value. The order value is defined as extended_price * quantity,"SELECT n_name AS nation_name, AVG(l_extendedprice * l_quantity) AS average_order_value FROM nation JOIN customer ON n_nationkey = c_nationkey JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey GROUP BY n_name;",,"Okay, let's analyze this request:

1.  Apply `PARTITION` in the `nations` collection, partitioning it by `name`.
2.  Calculate the average order value.
3.  Return the `nation_name` and `average_order_value`.
4.  Definition: `average_order_value` = `AVG(extended_price * quantity)`

First, I need to understand the relationships in the database:

*   `nations` has `customers`
*   `customers` has `orders`
*   `orders` has `lines`
*   `lines` has `extended_price` and `quantity`

So to calculate the average order value per nation, we need to:

1.  Partition the `nations` collection by `name`.
2.  For each nation, access its customers, then their orders, and then the lines in those orders.
3.  Calculate `extended_price * quantity` for each line.
4.  Calculate the average of these values for each nation.
5.  Return the nation's name and the calculated average order value.

    nation_name=name,
    average_order_value=AVG(nation_group.customers.orders.lines.CALCULATE(order_value=extended_price * quantity).order_value)
)
```

This code:

1.  Partitions the `nations` collection by `name`, naming the partition `nation_group`.
2.  Calculates the `average_order_value` for each partition by accessing the customers, orders, and lines within each nation.
3.  Calculates the `order_value` for each line as `extended_price * quantity`.
4.  Averages these `order_value` across all lines within each nation.
5.  Returns the `nation_name` and the calculated `average_order_value`.

Explanation:

1.  **`filtered_lines`**: The original code had an error because it was missing the `TPCH.` prefix when accessing the `lines` collection. I have corrected this by changing `lines` to `TPCH.lines`.
2.  **`part_type_counts`**: The original code was trying to count `sc.part_type`, but `COUNT` expects a collection. I have corrected this by counting `sc` instead, which represents the group in the partition. Also, I have added `part_type` to the `by` parameter in the `PARTITION` function.
3.  **`most_common_part_types`**: The original code was trying to access `ptc.part_type.TOP_K(1, by=ptc.part_type_count.DESC()).SINGULAR()`, but `TOP_K` returns a collection, and we need to extract the `part_type` from it. I have corrected this by adding `.part_type` at the end of the expression.
4.  **`percentage_purchases`**: Added `part_type = part_type` to CALCULATE to be able to use it in the IFF function.

1. **Filter by country code**: We need to filter customers based on the country code of their phone number. The country code is the first 2 or 3 digits of the phone number.
2. **Customers who have not placed an order**: We need to identify customers who have not placed any orders.

6. **Group by country code**: Group the filtered customers by their country code.
7. **Count customers**: Count the number of customers in each group.
8. **Total balance**: Calculate the total balance for each group.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
country_codes = (""13"", ""23"", ""29"", ""30"", ""18"", ""17"")

filtered_customers = customers.WHERE(
    ISIN(phone[:2], country_codes) | ISIN(phone[:3], country_codes)

    country_code=phone[:3],
    customer_count=COUNT(custs),
    total_balance=SUM(custs.acctbal)
)
```

Explanation:

1.  `country_codes`: Defines a tuple of country codes to include.
2.  `filtered_customers`: Filters the `customers` collection to include only those with country codes in the `country_codes` list and who have not placed any orders (`HASNOT(orders) == 1`).
3.  `positive_balance_customers`: Filters the `filtered_customers` collection to include only those with positive account balances (`acctbal > 0`).
4.  `average_balance`: Calculates the average account balance for all customers with positive account balances using `CALCULATE` and `AVG`. The `SINGULAR()` function is used to extract the single average value.
5.  `above_average_customers`: Filters the `positive_balance_customers` collection to include only those with account balances above the calculated `average_balance`.
6.  `customer_summary`: Partitions the `above_average_customers` collection by the first 3 digits of their phone number (country code). It then calculates the country code, the number of customers in each group (`customer_count`), and the total balance for each group (`total_balance`).

```python
country_codes = (""13"", ""23"", ""29"", ""30"", ""18"", ""17"")

filtered_customers = customers.WHERE(
    ISIN(phone[:2], country_codes) | ISIN(phone[:3], country_codes)
).WHERE(HASNOT(orders) == 1)

positive_balance_customers = filtered_customers.WHERE(acctbal > 0)

average_balance = positive_balance_customers.CALCULATE(
    avg_acctbal=AVG(acctbal)
).SINGULAR().avg_acctbal

above_average_customers = positive_balance_customers.WHERE(acctbal > average_balance)

customer_summary = PARTITION(above_average_customers, name=""custs"", by=phone[:3]).CALCULATE(
    country_code=phone[:3],
    customer_count=COUNT(custs),
    total_balance=SUM(custs.acctbal)
)
```

**Reasoning for the fix:**

The original code had an error in the line calculating the average balance:

```python
average_balance = TPCH.CALCULATE(
    avg_acctbal=AVG(positive_balance_customers.acctbal)
).SINGULAR().avg_acctbal
```

The error message `Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'customers' in graph 'TPCH': 'TPCH'` indicates that you cannot directly perform calculations on a collection within `TPCH` like that.  `TPCH` is meant for calculations across the entire dataset, not for operating on a filtered subset of `customers`.

The fix is to calculate the average directly from the `positive_balance_customers` collection:

```python
average_balance = positive_balance_customers.CALCULATE(
    avg_acctbal=AVG(acctbal)
).SINGULAR().avg_acctbal
```

This calculates the average account balance only for the filtered customers with positive balances, which aligns with the problem description.  The rest of the code remains the same as it correctly implements the other steps in the problem description.

1.  We need to find customers in Europe.

3.  We need to filter out customers who didn't place any orders in 1995.
4.  We need to sort the results in descending order by the number of orders.

).WHERE(num_orders > 0).ORDER_BY(num_orders.DESC())
```

Explanation:

1.  `regions.WHERE(name == ""EUROPE"").nations.customers`: This starts from the `regions` collection, filters for the region named ""EUROPE"", and then navigates to the `nations` within that region and then to the `customers` in those nations.
2.  `.CALCULATE(customer_name=name, num_orders=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)))`: This calculates the `customer_name` and the `num_orders` placed by each customer in 1995. The `COUNT` function counts the number of orders where the year is 1995.
3.  `.WHERE(num_orders > 0)`: This filters the results to include only customers who placed at least one order in 1995.
4.  `.ORDER_BY(num_orders.DESC())`: This sorts the results in descending order based on the number of orders.

**Explanation:**

The error ""keyword argument repeated: months_since_last_order"" occurred because the same field name `months_since_last_order` was being used multiple times in the final `CALCULATE` statement. To fix this, I renamed the fields in the final `CALCULATE` to `customer_name_result`, `total_spent_result`, and `months_since_last_order_result` to avoid the repetition. Also, I changed the `ORDER_BY` to use the new `total_spent_result` field. This ensures that the code now functions correctly and returns the desired output without any errors.

Here's what we need to calculate:

1.  **Total Sales Amount**: This is derived from the total number of orders placed in 1996.
2.  **Tax**: The tax amount for the specified part.
3.  **Commission**: The commission amount (not directly available, so we'll assume it's zero or needs to be clarified).
4.  **SPM Formula**: `((Total Sales Amount - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Sales Amount) * 100`

Here's the information we have:

*   Part Name: 'Rosy Black Navajo Cream Sky'
*   Country: China
*   Month: February
*   Year: 1996

Here's what we need to do:

1.  Filter for the specified part and country.
2.  Filter for the specified month and year.
3.  Calculate the total sales amount.
4.  Calculate the tax amount.
5.  Apply the SPM formula.

Before generating the code, I need to clarify one thing:

*   **Commission**: The description mentions ""Commission,"" but it's not clear where this information is stored. Should I assume it's zero, or is there a specific field I should be looking at?

I will assume the commission is zero.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Start with `parts`**: We start by filtering the `parts` collection to find the part named 'Rosy Black Navajo Cream Sky'.
2.  **Calculate `total_sales_amount`**: We calculate the sum of `extended_price` for all line items associated with the part, filtering by the order date (February 1996) and supplier's nation (China).
3.  **Calculate `total_tax`**: We calculate the sum of `tax` for all line items associated with the part, filtering by the order date (February 1996) and supplier's nation (China).
4.  **Calculate `spm`**: We apply the SPM formula using the calculated `total_sales_amount` and `total_tax`.
