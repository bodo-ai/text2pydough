1.  **Goal:** Get the count of customers and suppliers for *each* nation.
2.  **Output Fields:** Nation name, customer count, supplier count.
3.  **Grouping:** The counts need to be per nation.
4.  **Sorting:** The result should be ordered by nation name (alphabetically, ascending).
5.  **Collections:** We'll need the `nations` collection and its relationships to `customers` and `suppliers`.
6.  **Operations:**
    *   We can start with the `nations` collection.
    *   For each nation, we can use `CALCULATE` to get its name and count the related customers and suppliers using `COUNT(customers)` and `COUNT(suppliers)`.
    *   Finally, we use `ORDER_BY` on the nation name.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 nations based on the total number of orders placed by their customers in 1995.
2.  **Starting Collection:** We need information aggregated at the nation level, so `nations` is the logical starting point.
3.  **Relationships:** We need to traverse from `nations` to `customers` and then to `orders`.
4.  **Filtering:** We need to filter the `orders` to include only those where the `order_date` year is 1995.
5.  **Aggregation:** For each nation, we need to count the number of filtered orders. `COUNT` is the appropriate function.
6.  **Ranking:** We need the top 5 nations based on this count, sorted in descending order. `TOP_K` is the correct function for this.
7.  **Output:** The request implies we need the nation names and potentially the order count that determined the ranking.

4.  **`customers.orders`**: Inside the `COUNT`, we navigate from the current nation to its associated `customers` and then to their `orders`.
5.  **`.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`**: We filter these orders, keeping only those where the `YEAR` extracted from the `order_date` is equal to 1995.

*   For each region, we need to calculate the total order value for orders placed in 1996 by customers within that region.
*   The path to the relevant line items is `regions` -> `nations` -> `customers` -> `orders` -> `lines`.
*   We must filter `orders` by `YEAR(order_date) == 1996`.
*   Inside the `lines` collection for those filtered orders, we need to calculate `extended_price * (1 - discount)` for each line. An inner `CALCULATE` is required here because we are performing an operation involving multiple fields (`extended_price`, `discount`) within the `lines` sub-collection before aggregation.
*   We then need to `SUM` these calculated line values at the region level.
*   Finally, we use `TOP_K(1, ...)` to select the single region with the highest calculated value.

4.  `nations.customers.orders`: We navigate from the region down through its nations, customers, and their orders.
5.  `.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1996)`: We filter these orders to include only those placed in the year 1996.
6.  `.lines`: We access the line items associated with these filtered orders.
7.  `.CALCULATE(line_val=extended_price * (1 - discount))`: For each line item, we calculate its individual value (`extended_price * (1 - discount)`) and assign it to a temporary field `line_val`. This inner `CALCULATE` is necessary to perform the multiplication and subtraction before the `SUM` aggregation.
8.  `.line_val`: We specify that the `SUM` function should aggregate the `line_val` calculated in the previous step.
9.  `.TOP_K(1, by=total_order_value.DESC())`: After calculating the `total_order_value` for all regions, we use `TOP_K` to select only the top 1 region, ordered by `total_order_value` in descending order (highest value first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PARTITION(parts, name='part_group', by=name)`**: This function groups the `parts` collection based on the unique values in the `name` field. Each group (partition) contains all records from the `parts` collection that share the same `name`. We assign the name `part_group` to refer to the records within each partition.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step performs calculations for each partition created in the previous step.
    *   `part_name=name`: Selects the part name, which is the key used for partitioning. Note that we access `name` directly as it's the partition key.
    *   `distinct_nation_count=NDISTINCT(part_group.supply_records.supplier.nation.name)`: For each `part_group` (representing parts with the same name), this calculates the number of distinct nations that supply these parts. It navigates from the parts in the group (`part_group`) through their `supply_records`, then to the `supplier`, then to the supplier's `nation`, and finally accesses the `name` of the nation. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique nation names found.
3.  **`.WHERE(distinct_nation_count >= 5)`**: This filters the results, keeping only those partitions (parts) where the calculated `distinct_nation_count` is greater than or equal to 5.

1.  **`customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute the required fields for each customer.
2.  **`customer_name=name, customer_address=address`**: We select the customer's name and address.
3.  **`total_green_quantity_1998=SUM(...)`**: We calculate the total quantity of specific products ordered by each customer.
    *   **`orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1998)`**: We access the customer's `orders` and filter them to include only those placed in the year 1998.
    *   **`.lines.WHERE(CONTAINS(part.name, 'green'))`**: From the filtered orders, we access the `lines` (line items) and further filter these to include only lines where the associated `part`'s `name` contains the substring 'green'.
    *   **`.quantity`**: We select the `quantity` field from these filtered line items.
    *   **`SUM(...)`**: The `SUM` function aggregates the quantities from all the filtered line items for the current customer.
4.  **`.TOP_K(10, by=total_green_quantity_1998.DESC())`**: After calculating the name, address, and total quantity for all customers, we use `TOP_K` to select the 10 customers with the highest `total_green_quantity_1998`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the highest quantities rank first.","top_green_customers = customers.CALCULATE(

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the average discount for orders, grouped by the customer's market segment.
2.  **Data Needed:**
    *   Market segment (`mktsegment` from `customers`).
    *   Discount (`discount` from `lines`).
3.  **Relationship:** `customers` -> `orders` -> `lines`. The `mktsegment` is at the `customers` level, and the `discount` is at the `lines` level.
4.  **Grouping:** We need to group the results by `mktsegment`. This indicates the use of `PARTITION`.
5.  **Calculation:** Within each group (market segment), we need the *average* of the `discount` values from all associated order lines.
6.  **Sorting:** The final result should be sorted by the calculated average discount in descending order.

```python
# Partition customers by market segment
avg_discount_by_segment = PARTITION(
    customers,
    name='cust_group',  # Name for the partitioned group
    by=mktsegment      # Group by the market segment field
).CALCULATE(
    # Select the market segment (partition key)
    market_segment=mktsegment,
    # Calculate the average discount for all lines within this segment's customer orders
    average_discount=AVG(cust_group.orders.lines.discount)
).ORDER_BY(
    # Sort the results by the calculated average discount in descending order
    average_discount.DESC()
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PARTITION(customers, name='cust_group', by=mktsegment)`**: This function groups the `customers` collection based on the unique values in their `mktsegment` field. Each group is temporarily named `cust_group`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step performs calculations for each partition (market segment).
    *   `market_segment=mktsegment`: Selects the market segment value for the current partition. Since `mktsegment` is the partitioning key, we refer to it directly.
    *   `average_discount=AVG(cust_group.orders.lines.discount)`: Calculates the average discount. It accesses the customers within the current partition (`cust_group`), navigates to their `orders`, then to the `lines` of those orders, and finally applies the `AVG` aggregation function to the `discount` field across all those lines.
3.  **`.ORDER_BY(average_discount.DESC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection (which contains one row per market segment) in descending order based on the `average_discount` calculated in the previous step.","# PARTITION customers by market segment

**Explanation:**

1.  **`line_data_1998`**: We start by filtering the `lines` collection to include only those associated with orders placed in 1998 (`YEAR(order.order_date) == 1998`). We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `mktsegment` from the related customer (`order.customer.mktsegment`) and the `name` of the related part (`part.name`), renaming them to `segment` and `p_name` respectively.
2.  **`segment_part_counts`**: We use `PARTITION` to group the `line_data_1998` by both `segment` and `p_name`. For each unique combination (a specific part within a specific segment in 1998), we use `CALCULATE` to count the number of line items in that group using `COUNT(segment_part_group)`. This count represents the number of times that part was ordered within that segment in 1998. The result is a collection where each row represents a unique part within a segment and its corresponding order count for 1998.
3.  **`segment_partition`**: We partition the `segment_part_counts` collection again, this time only by `segment`. This groups all the parts (and their counts) belonging to the same market segment together. This step is crucial for applying the ranking correctly within each segment.
4.  **`ranked_products_in_segment`**: We access the grouped data using `segment_partition.final_segment_group`. For each part within a segment group, we use `CALCULATE` to compute its rank. `RANKING(by=order_count.DESC(), levels=1)` ranks the parts based on `order_count` in descending order. `levels=1` ensures the ranking is performed independently *within* each segment group established by the `segment_partition`.
5.  **`top_20_products_per_segment`**: We filter the ranked results using `WHERE` to keep only those rows where the calculated `product_rank_in_segment` is less than or equal to 20.
6.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required output fields (`market_segment`, `product_name`, `order_count`) and apply an `ORDER_BY` clause to sort the final results first by market segment and then by order count (descending) for clarity.","# 1.

1.  `supplier_sales_data`: We start from `regions`, access `nations` and then `suppliers`. For each supplier, we calculate `total_supplier_sales` by summing the product of `extended_price` and `quantity` from their associated `lines`. We also carry forward the `region_name`.
2.  `ranked_suppliers_by_region`: We take the previous result and add a `sales_rank_in_region`. This rank is calculated using the `RANKING` function based on `total_supplier_sales` in descending order. `levels=2` ensures the ranking is performed independently within each region (since the hierarchy is `regions` -> `nations` -> `suppliers`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each customer.
2.  **`orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`**: For each customer, this accesses their `orders` sub-collection, filters them to include only those where the `order_date` is in the year 1995 using `WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`, and then counts the remaining orders using `COUNT()`. The result is stored in the temporary field `orders_1995`.
3.  **`orders_1994=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994))`**: Similarly, this calculates the count of orders placed by the customer in 1994 and stores it in `orders_1994`.

6.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_name=cust_name)`**: Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` on the filtered results to select *only* the customer's name (which we carried through as `cust_name`), renaming it to `customer_name` as requested in the output.","customers_more_orders_1995 = customers.CALCULATE(

1.  **Partition:** We need to partition the `nations` collection.

4.  **Definition:** `average_order_value` is defined as `AVG(extended_price * quantity)`. This calculation needs to happen across all `lines` associated with each nation.
5.  **Access Path:** To get `extended_price` and `quantity` from `nations`, we need to go through `nations` -> `customers` -> `orders` -> `lines`.
6.  **Output:** Return the `nation_name` and the calculated `average_order_value`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PARTITION(nations, name='nation_group', by=name)`**: This function groups the `nations` collection based on the unique values in the `name` field. Each group (partition) is temporarily named `nation_group`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This method operates on each partition created by `PARTITION`.
3.  **`nation_name=name`**: Inside the `CALCULATE`, we select the `name` field. Since `name` is the partition key specified in `by=name`, we can access it directly without using the partition name (`nation_group`). We assign it to the output field `nation_name`.
4.  **`average_order_value=AVG(...)`**: We define the `average_order_value` field.
5.  **`AVG(...)`**: This aggregation function calculates the average of the expression provided.
6.  **`nation_group.customers.orders.lines`**: We navigate from the current partition (`nation_group`) through its `customers`, their `orders`, and finally to the `lines` associated with those orders.
7.  **`.CALCULATE(line_item_value=extended_price * quantity)`**: Before averaging, we perform a nested `CALCULATE` on the `lines` collection to compute the value (`extended_price * quantity`) for each individual line item, assigning it to a temporary field `line_item_value`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`lines_info = lines.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by creating an intermediate view `lines_info` from the `lines` collection. This view calculates and includes:
    *   `brand_name`: Extracted from the related `part` (`part.brand`).
    *   `order_year`: Extracted from the related `order`'s `order_date` (`YEAR(order.order_date)`).
    *   `line_quantity`: Renamed from `quantity` for clarity.
    This step makes `brand_name` and `order_year` directly accessible for partitioning and filtering.

2.  **`PARTITION(lines_info, name='brand_group', by=brand_name)`**: We partition the `lines_info` collection by `brand_name`. Each partition (`brand_group`) contains all line items belonging to a specific brand.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(brand_name=brand_name, ...)`**: Within each partition, we calculate:
    *   `brand_name`: We select the partition key itself.
    *   `quantity_1995`: We sum the `line_quantity` for lines within the current `brand_group` where the `order_year` is 1995. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0)` ensures that if a brand had no sales in 1995, the quantity is treated as 0 instead of NULL.
    *   `quantity_1996`: Similarly, we sum the `line_quantity` for lines where the `order_year` is 1996, defaulting to 0 if necessary.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(..., quantity_diff=quantity_1996 - quantity_1995)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used because we need the results (`quantity_1995`, `quantity_1996`) from the previous step. Here, we calculate `quantity_diff` as the difference between the 1996 and 1995 quantities for each brand. We also carry forward the `brand_name`, `quantity_1995`, and `quantity_1996` fields.

5.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=quantity_diff.DESC())`**: Finally, we select the top 3 records (brands) based on the calculated `quantity_diff`, sorting them in descending order (largest positive difference first). The result includes `brand_name`, `quantity_1995`, `quantity_1996`, and `quantity_diff`.","# First, create a view of lines including the brand and order year for easier partitioning

3.  **Filtering:** Only consider orders placed in the year 1994.
4.  **Output:** Return the customer's key, name, and their calculated total revenue.
5.  **Sorting:** Sort the results by total revenue in descending order.

**Approach:**

1.  Start with the `customers` collection as we need results per customer.
2.  For each customer, access their `orders`.
3.  Filter these `orders` to include only those where `YEAR(order_date) == 1994`.
4.  For these filtered orders, access their `lines`.
5.  Inside the `lines`, calculate the revenue for each line item: `extended_price * (1 - discount)`. We'll use an inner `CALCULATE` for this.
6.  Sum the calculated line item revenues for each customer using `SUM()`.
7.  Use a top-level `CALCULATE` on the `customers` collection to select the `key`, `name`, and the calculated `total_revenue`.
8.  Apply `ORDER_BY` to sort the final result.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `customers` collection and begin defining the output fields.
2.  `c_key=key, c_name=name`: We select the customer's key and name, renaming them to `c_key` and `c_name` to avoid potential naming conflicts.
3.  `total_revenue=SUM(...)`: We define a new field `total_revenue`. Its value is the sum of revenues from the customer's relevant line items.
4.  `orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994)`: We access the customer's orders and filter them to keep only those placed in 1994.
5.  `.lines`: We access the line items belonging to these filtered orders.
6.  `.CALCULATE(line_revenue=extended_price * (1 - discount))`: For each line item, we calculate its individual revenue using the provided formula and store it temporarily as `line_revenue`.
7.  `.line_revenue`: We access the `line_revenue` calculated in the previous step so that the `SUM()` function can aggregate these values for the customer.
8.  `.ORDER_BY(total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, we sort the resulting collection of customers based on their calculated `total_revenue` in descending order.","# CALCULATE total revenue for each customer in 1994

**Explanation:**

1.  `PARTITION(parts, name='parts_by_size', by=size)`: Groups the `parts` collection into partitions based on unique values of the `size` field. Each partition is accessible via the name `parts_by_size`.
2.  `.CALCULATE(part_size=size)`: Within the context of the partitions (not the individual parts yet), we calculate `part_size` which is simply the `size` value that defines the partition. This is needed for the next step.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=part_size.DESC())`: Selects the 5 partitions corresponding to the 5 numerically largest `size` values.
4.  `.parts_by_size`: Accesses the collection of *actual parts* belonging to the top 5 size partitions selected in the previous step.
5.  `.CALCULATE(rank_in_size=RANKING(by=retail_price.DESC(), levels=1, allow_ties=False))`: For each part within these selected partitions, it calculates its rank based on `retail_price` in descending order. `levels=1` ensures the ranking is performed *within* each size group (partition). `allow_ties=False` means only one part will get rank 1 if there's a tie (the specific one chosen depends on underlying database ordering).
6.  `.WHERE(rank_in_size == 1)`: Filters the results to keep only the part with the highest `retail_price` (rank 1) within each of the top 5 size groups.
7.  `.CALCULATE(part_key=key, part_name=name, part_size=size, retail_price=retail_price)`: Selects the final desired fields (`key`, `name`, `size`, `retail_price`) for the resulting top part from each of the 5 largest size groups.

The error message `'Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'lines' in graph 'TPCH': 'key'` indicates that you are trying to access a field named `key` directly on the `lines` collection, but this field does not exist at that level according to the schema. The `lines` collection has fields like `order_key`, `part_key`, `supplier_key`, and `line_number`, but not a simple `key`.

Looking at your code, the error occurs in the first `CALCULATE` block:

```python
relevant_lines_info = lines.WHERE(

The field `line_key = key` is causing the problem. Since this field isn't actually used in the subsequent calculations (as noted in the comment, `COUNT(group)` is sufficient), we can simply remove it.

**Explanation of Correction:**

1.  **Removed `line_key = key`**: The primary correction was removing the line `line_key = key` from the initial `CALCULATE` on the `lines` collection. The field `key` is not directly available on `lines`, causing the `Unrecognized term` error. This field was also unnecessary for the subsequent logic, which relies on `COUNT` within partitions.
2.  **Logic Preservation**: The rest of the code structure, including the filtering, partitioning by supplier region, nested partitioning by part type, finding the top part type count, and calculating the final percentage, remains the same as it correctly addresses the core logic of finding the percentage contribution of the most common part type within each supplier region's relevant shipments.","relevant_lines_info = lines.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`allowed_codes = (""13"", ""23"", ""29"", ""30"", ""18"", ""17"")`**: Defines the list of country codes (as strings) to filter by.
2.  **`customers_with_code = customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: Starts with the `customers` collection and calculates two new fields:
    *   `country_code`: Extracts the first 3 characters from the `phone` number.
    *   `cust_acctbal`: Selects the `acctbal` for later use.
3.  **`filtered_by_code = customers_with_code.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the results to include only customers whose `country_code` is in the `allowed_codes` list using `ISIN`.
4.  **`no_order_customers = filtered_by_code.WHERE(...)`**: Further filters the results to keep only customers who have *not* placed any orders, using `HASNOT(orders) == 1`.
5.  **`qualifying_customers = no_order_customers.WHERE(...)`**: This is the core filtering step based on account balance. It keeps customers where:
    *   `cust_acctbal` (the customer's account balance) is greater than...
    *   `RELAVG(KEEP_IF(cust_acctbal, cust_acctbal > 0))`: This calculates the average account balance *only* for customers within the `no_order_customers` collection who have a positive balance (`cust_acctbal > 0`). `RELAVG` without a `levels` argument computes the average across the entire current collection (`no_order_customers`).
6.  **`customer_breakdown = PARTITION(...)`**: Groups the `qualifying_customers` based on their `country_code`.
    *   `name='cust_group'`: Assigns a name to access the data within each partition.
    *   `by=country_code`: Specifies the field to group by.
7.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition (i.e., for each country code group):
    *   `country_code=country_code`: Selects the country code for the group.
    *   `num_qualifying_customers=COUNT(cust_group)`: Counts the number of customers within that specific country code group.
    *   `total_qualifying_balance=SUM(cust_group.cust_acctbal)`: Calculates the sum of account balances for all customers within that group.

The final `customer_breakdown` variable holds the results, with each row representing a country code and containing the count of qualifying customers and their total balance for that code.","# Define the country codes to include (as strings, since phone[:3] is a string)

**Analysis:**

1.  **Target Collection:** We need information about `customers`.
2.  **Filtering Criteria:**
    *   Customers must be from the ""EUROPE"" region. This involves navigating `customers` -> `nation` -> `region`.
    *   Customers must have placed at least one order in 1995. This means the count of their orders from 1995 must be greater than 0.
3.  **Calculations:** For each qualifying customer, we need to count the number of orders placed specifically in 1995.
4.  **Output Fields:** Customer name (`name`) and the calculated count of 1995 orders.
5.  **Sorting:** The results should be sorted by the count of 1995 orders in descending order.

**PyDough Implementation:**

```python
# Find European customers who placed orders in 1995
european_customers_1995_orders = customers.WHERE(nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"").CALCULATE(
    # Select the customer's name
    customer_name=name,
    # Count only the orders placed in 1995 for this customer
    num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
# Filter out customers who had zero orders in 1995
).WHERE(num_orders_1995 > 0
# Sort the results by the number of 1995 orders in descending order
).ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers.WHERE(nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"")`**: We start with the `customers` collection and filter it to include only those whose associated nation belongs to the ""EUROPE"" region.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each of these European customers, we calculate two fields:
    *   `customer_name=name`: We select the customer's name and assign it to the `customer_name` field in the output.
    *   `num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: We access the customer's `orders` sub-collection, filter these orders to keep only those where the `YEAR` of the `order_date` is 1995, and then `COUNT` the remaining orders. This count is assigned to the `num_orders_1995` field.
3.  **`.WHERE(num_orders_1995 > 0)`**: After calculating the number of 1995 orders for each European customer, we apply another filter to keep only those customers whose `num_orders_1995` is greater than 0, satisfying the ""placed at least one order"" requirement.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting collection of customers based on their `num_orders_1995` count in descending order (highest count first).","# Find European customers who placed orders in 1995

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_data = customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `customers` collection and calculate several intermediate fields for each customer:
    *   `cust_key`, `cust_name`: Select the customer's key and name.
    *   `has_order_1996`: Uses `HAS` and `WHERE` to check if the customer has at least one order placed in the year 1996. The result is a boolean (True/False).
    *   `has_order_1997`: Similarly, checks if the customer has at least one order placed in 1997.
    *   `total_spent_calc`: Calculates the sum of `total_price` for *all* orders associated with the customer.
    *   `last_order_dt`: Finds the maximum (most recent) `order_date` among all the customer's orders.

2.  **`filtered_customers = customer_data.WHERE(...)`**: This step filters the `customer_data` based on the required conditions:
    *   `has_order_1996`: Ensures the customer ordered in 1996 (the calculated value is True).
    *   `~has_order_1997`: Ensures the customer did *not* order in 1997 (negates the `has_order_1997` boolean, so we keep customers where it was False).
    *   `(total_spent_calc > 1000)`: Ensures the total amount spent is greater than $1000.
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions logically (AND).

3.  **`customers_filtered_sorted = filtered_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We take the filtered customers and calculate the final output fields:
    *   `customer_name`: Selects the customer's name (using the previously calculated `cust_name`).
    *   `total_spent`: Selects the total spent amount (using `total_spent_calc`).
    *   `months_since_last_order`: Uses the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference in ""months"" between the customer's last order date (`last_order_dt`) and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`).

4.  **`.ORDER_BY(total_spent.DESC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted in descending order based on the `total_spent` field, placing customers who spent the most at the top.","# CALCULATE intermediate values for filtering and final calculation

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Constants:** We first define variables for the specific part name, nation name, year, and month to make the query clearer and easier to modify.
2.  **Filter Line Items:** We start with the `lines` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `part.name == target_part_name`: Selects lines associated with the part 'Rosy Black Navajo Cream Sky'.
    *   `supplier.nation.name == target_nation_name`: Selects lines where the supplier is located in 'CHINA'.
    *   `(YEAR(order.order_date) == target_year) & (MONTH(order.order_date) == target_month)`: Selects lines from orders placed in February 1996.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates:** We use `TPCH.CALCULATE` to perform global aggregations on the `filtered_lines`:
    *   `total_sales_amount`: We first calculate the net sales (`extended_price * (1 - discount)`) for each filtered line item within an inner `CALCULATE` and then sum these values using `SUM`. This represents the total revenue after discounts.
    *   `total_tax_amount`: We calculate the sum of the `tax` for all filtered line items.
4.  **Calculate SPM:** In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step:
    *   We add the `supplier_nation` directly as ""CHINA"", since the filtering step ensures all considered lines belong to suppliers from China.
    *   We calculate the `selling_profit_margin` using the formula `(Total Sales Amount - Total Tax) / Total Sales Amount * 100.0`.
    *   We use `IFF(total_sales_amount == 0, 0.0, ...)` to prevent division by zero errors, returning 0.0% SPM if there were no sales matching the criteria. We multiply by `100.0` to express the result as a percentage and ensure floating-point division.
