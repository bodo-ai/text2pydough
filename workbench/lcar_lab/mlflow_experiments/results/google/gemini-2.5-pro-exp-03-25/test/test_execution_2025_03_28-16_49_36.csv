    n_suppliers=COUNT(nations.suppliers)
)","Okay, let's break down the request: ""List the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. Order by nation name.""

1.  **Goal:** We need to iterate through each nation, count its associated customers and suppliers, and then sort the results alphabetically by the nation's name.
2.  **Starting Collection:** The natural starting point is the `nations` collection, as the primary grouping is by nation.
3.  **Calculations per Nation:** For each nation, we need two counts:
    *   The count of customers linked to that nation (`COUNT(customers)`).
    *   The count of suppliers linked to that nation (`COUNT(suppliers)`).
    *   We also need the nation's name (`name`).
    *   The `CALCULATE` function on the `nations` collection is perfect for this, as it processes each nation row and allows aggregations on its sub-collections.
4.  **Ordering:** After calculating the counts, the results need to be sorted by the nation's name in ascending order. The `ORDER_BY` function is used for this.
5.  **PARTITION Check:** Is `PARTITION` needed? No. Since we are starting with the `nations` collection and performing calculations directly related to each nation (counting its immediate sub-collections), a simple `CALCULATE` on `nations` is sufficient and more direct. `PARTITION` is typically used when you need to group a *different* collection based on some key (like partitioning `customers` by `nation_key`).

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Calculate the number of customers and suppliers for each nation, ordered by nation name.
nation_customer_supplier_counts = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_customers=COUNT(customers),
    num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `nations` collection and calculates new fields for each nation.
2.  `nation_name=name`: Selects the `name` field from the current nation and assigns it to the output field `nation_name`.
3.  `num_customers=COUNT(customers)`: For the current nation, it counts the number of records in its `customers` sub-collection and assigns the result to `num_customers`.
4.  `num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)`: Similarly, it counts the number of records in the current nation's `suppliers` sub-collection and assigns the result to `num_suppliers`.
5.  `.ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())`: After the calculations are done for all nations, this sorts the resulting collection in ascending order based on the `nation_name` field.","# CALCULATE the number of customers and suppliers for each nation, ordered by nation name.

1.  **Goal:** Identify the 5 nations that had the most orders placed by their associated customers during the year 1995.
2.  **Entities:** We need `nations`, `customers`, and `orders`.
3.  **Relationships:** `nations` have `customers`, and `customers` have `orders`.
4.  **Filtering:** We need to filter `orders` based on the `order_date` to only include those from 1995 (`YEAR(order_date) == 1995`).
5.  **Aggregation:** For each nation, we need to count the number of orders that meet the 1995 criteria.
6.  **Ranking:** We need to find the top 5 nations based on this count, in descending order.

Here's the PyDough code to achieve this:

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `nations` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute values for each nation.
2.  `nation_name=name`: We select the name of the nation and assign it to the `nation_name` field in the output.
3.  `order_count_1995=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`:
    *   `customers.orders`: For each nation, we access its associated `customers` and then their `orders`.
    *   `.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`: We filter these orders to include only those where the year of the `order_date` is 1995.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: We count the number of orders remaining after the filter for the current nation. This count is assigned to the `order_count_1995` field.
4.  `.TOP_K(5, by=order_count_1995.DESC())`: After calculating the name and order count for all nations, we use `TOP_K` to select the 5 nations with the highest `order_count_1995`.

2.  `region_name=name`: We select the name of the region.
3.  `total_order_value=SUM(...)`: We calculate the total order value for the region using the `SUM` aggregation function.
4.  `nations.customers.orders`: We navigate from the region down through its nations, customers, and their orders.
5.  `.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1996)`: We filter these orders to include only those placed in 1996.
6.  `.lines`: We access the line items associated with these filtered orders.
7.  `.CALCULATE(line_value=extended_price * (1 - discount))`: For each line item, we calculate its individual value according to the provided definition (`extended_price * (1 - discount)`) and store it temporarily as `line_value`. This inner `CALCULATE` is necessary because we need to perform the multiplication and subtraction *before* summing.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`regions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `regions` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each region.
2.  **`region_name=name`**: We select the `name` of the region and assign it to a new field called `region_name`.
3.  **`distinct_customer_count=NDISTINCT(nations.customers.key)`**:
    *   We navigate from each `region` to its `nations`, then to the `customers` within those nations.
    *   `NDISTINCT(nations.customers.key)` counts the number of unique customer keys (`key`) across all nations within that specific region. This gives us the total count of distinct customers per region.
    *   This count is assigned to the field `distinct_customer_count`.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=distinct_customer_count.DESC())`**:
    *   We apply the `TOP_K` function to the results of the `CALCULATE`.
    *   `3` specifies that we want the top 3 regions.
    *   `by=distinct_customer_count.DESC()` indicates that the ranking should be based on the `distinct_customer_count` field in descending order (highest count first).

1.  **Identify the Core Collection:** We need information about customers, their location, account balance, and orders. The `customers` collection is the best starting point.
2.  **Filtering Conditions:**
    *   Location: Customers must be in Europe (`nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""`).
    *   Account Balance: Must be greater than $700 (`acctbal > 700`).
    *   Orders in 1995: Must have placed at least one order in 1995. We can check this using `HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1`.
3.  **Data to Calculate:**
    *   Customer Name: `name`.
    *   Number of Orders in 1995: We need to count the orders specifically from 1995 for each customer: `COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`.
4.  **Sorting:** The result should be sorted by the number of orders placed in 1995 in descending order.

Combining these steps leads to the following PyDough query:

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers.WHERE(...)`: We start with the `customers` collection and apply filters.
2.  `(nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"")`: Filters customers whose nation belongs to the ""EUROPE"" region.

5.  **Ranking:** Select the top 10 customers based on the aggregated quantity (`TOP_K`).
6.  **Output:** Customer `name`, `address`, and the calculated `total_quantity`.

top_customers_green_products = customers.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate the total quantity of 'green' parts ordered in 1998 for each customer
    total_quantity=SUM(
        # Access customer orders and filter by year 1998

```

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `customers` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to compute a new field `total_quantity` for each customer and select the required `customer_name` and `customer_address`.
3.  Inside the `CALCULATE`, `total_quantity` is determined by:
    *   Accessing the customer's `orders`.
    *   Filtering these `orders` using `WHERE` to keep only those from the year 1998 (`YEAR(order_date) == 1998`).
    *   Accessing the `lines` for these filtered orders.
    *   Filtering these `lines` using `WHERE` to keep only those associated with a `part` whose `name` contains the string 'green' (`CONTAINS(part.name, 'green')`).
    *   Selecting the `quantity` from these filtered lines.
    *   Aggregating these quantities using `SUM()` to get the total quantity per customer meeting the criteria.
4.  Finally, `TOP_K(10, by=total_quantity.DESC())` is applied to the result of the `CALCULATE` operation. This selects the 10 customers with the highest calculated `total_quantity`, ordered from highest to lowest. The final output includes `customer_name`, `customer_address`, and `total_quantity` for these top 10 customers.","top_customers_green_products = customers.CALCULATE(

**Original Question:** 'Which is the average discount applied on orders for each market segment? Sorted in descending order'.

**Provided Code:**
```python
# Step 1: Create a collection of line items, including the customer's market segment and the discount.
# We start from lines as discount is a line-level attribute.
lines_with_segment_info = TPCH.lines.CALCULATE(
    mktsegment=order.customer.mktsegment,
    line_discount=discount
)

# Step 2 & 3: Partition by market segment and calculate the average discount within each segment.
avg_discount_by_segment = PARTITION(
    lines_with_segment_info,
    name='segment_lines',  # Name for the partitioned group
    by=mktsegment        # Group by market segment

    average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount) # Calculate average discount for lines in this segment
).ORDER_BY(average_discount.DESC()) # Step 5: Sort by the calculated average discount descending
```

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the average `discount` from `lines` for each unique `mktsegment` from `customers`.
2.  **Data Path:** `lines` -> `order` -> `customer` -> `mktsegment`.
3.  **Approach:**
    *   The code first creates a temporary collection `lines_with_segment_info` containing each line item's discount and the associated customer's market segment. This is a valid way to bring the necessary data together.
    *   It then uses `PARTITION` to group these line items by `mktsegment`. This is the correct function for grouping.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`, it correctly accesses the partition key (`mktsegment`) and uses the partition name (`segment_lines`) with an aggregation function (`AVG`) to calculate the average discount for the lines within that segment.
    *   Finally, it sorts the results using `ORDER_BY` based on the calculated average discount.
4.  **PyDough Rules:** The code adheres to the rules:
    *   `PARTITION` is used correctly as a function with the required arguments (`Collection`, `name`, `by`).
    *   The partition key (`mktsegment`) is accessed directly in the subsequent `CALCULATE`.
    *   The partitioned data (`segment_lines`) is accessed within an aggregation function (`AVG`).
    *   `CALCULATE` is used appropriately to select and compute fields.
    *   `ORDER_BY` syntax is correct.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code appears to be correct and follows the PyDough syntax and rules as described in the cheat sheet. It logically addresses the original question. Since the reported error was empty (`''`), it's likely the code is functional.

    average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount) # Calculate average discount for lines in this segment
).ORDER_BY(average_discount.DESC()) # Sort by the calculated average discount descending
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `lines_with_segment_info = TPCH.lines.CALCULATE(...)`: This line starts with all line items (`TPCH.lines`). For each line item, it navigates through its corresponding `order` to the `customer` to retrieve the `mktsegment`. It also selects the `discount` for that line item, renaming it to `line_discount`. This creates a new temporary collection where each row represents a line item tagged with its discount and the market segment of the customer who placed the order.
2.  `PARTITION(lines_with_segment_info, name='segment_lines', by=mktsegment)`: This function takes the `lines_with_segment_info` collection and groups its rows based on the `mktsegment` field. All line items belonging to the same market segment are put into a group. The `name='segment_lines'` provides a way to refer to the collection of lines within each specific market segment group during the next step.
3.  `.CALCULATE(market_segment=mktsegment, average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount))`: This operation is performed for each group (market segment) created by `PARTITION`.
    *   `market_segment=mktsegment`: It selects the market segment value that defines the current group.
    *   `average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount)`: It calculates the average of the `line_discount` values for all line items (`segment_lines`) within the current market segment group.
4.  `.ORDER_BY(average_discount.DESC())`: Finally, the resulting collection (which now has one row per market segment with its average discount) is sorted in descending order based on the `average_discount`.","# Step 1: Create a collection of line items, including the customer's market segment and the discount.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`lines_1998_data`**: This filters the `lines` collection to include only line items from orders placed in 1998 (`YEAR(order.order_date) == 1998`). It then calculates and retains the market segment (`mktsegment`) from the customer associated with the order, the part name (`part_name`), and the unique order key (`order_key`).
2.  **`segment_part_order_counts`**: This takes the filtered 1998 data and partitions it first by `mktsegment` and then by `part_name`. For each unique combination of segment and part, it calculates the number of distinct orders (`order_count`) using `NDISTINCT(seg_part_group.order_key)`. This gives us the total number of orders associated with each specific part within each specific market segment in 1998.
3.  **`top_products_per_segment`**:
    *   This step takes the `segment_part_order_counts` (which contains segment, part name, and order count).
    *   It partitions this data again, this time only by `mktsegment`, using the name `segment_ranking_group`. This grouping is necessary to establish the context for ranking *within* each segment.
    *   It then accesses the collection within each partition (`segment_ranking_group`) which contains all the parts and their order counts for that specific segment.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` applied to `segment_ranking_group`, it calculates `rank_in_segment` using the `RANKING` function. `RANKING(by=order_count.DESC(), levels=1)` ranks the parts based on their `order_count` in descending order. `levels=1` ensures the ranking is performed separately within each market segment partition.
    *   The `.WHERE(rank_in_segment <= 20)` clause filters these results to keep only the parts that rank in the top 20 within their respective market segment.
    *   The final `.CALCULATE` selects the required output fields: `mktsegment`, `part_name`, and `order_count`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(mktsegment.ASC(), order_count.DESC())` sorts the final output first by market segment alphabetically and then by order count descending for better readability.","# Step 1: Filter lines for the year 1998 and CALCULATE necessary fields

The error occurs because the `RANKING` function is trying to use the `total_supplier_sales` field within the same `CALCULATE` clause where it's being defined. According to PyDough rules, fields created in a `CALCULATE` are only accessible *after* that `CALCULATE` operation is complete.

To fix this, we need to perform the calculation in two steps:
1.  Calculate the `total_supplier_sales` for each supplier within each region.
2.  In a subsequent step, calculate the `sales_rank` using the previously computed `total_supplier_sales`.

Here is the corrected PyDough code:

```python

supplier_sales_calc = regions.CALCULATE(
    r_name=name  # Calculate region name at the top level
).nations.suppliers.CALCULATE(
    region_name=r_name,  # Access the down-streamed region name
    supp_name=name,      # Get the supplier name
    # Calculate total sales for the supplier using the definition from the original attempt
    total_supplier_sales=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_sale=extended_price * quantity).line_sale)
)

    region=region_name,
    supplier_name=supp_name,
    total_sales=total_supplier_sales
)
```

**Explanation of Correction:**

1.  **`supplier_sales_calc`**: This first step navigates from `regions` down to `suppliers`. It calculates the `region_name` (passed down from `regions`), `supp_name`, and crucially, the `total_supplier_sales` for each supplier by summing the `extended_price * quantity` from their associated `lines`.
2.  **`supplier_ranking`**: This second step takes the result of `supplier_sales_calc`. Since `total_supplier_sales` is now an existing field in this intermediate result, we can safely use it within the `RANKING` function. We calculate `sales_rank` using `RANKING(by=total_supplier_sales.DESC(), levels=2)`. The `levels=2` parameter is essential because we are ranking `suppliers` relative to their `region` (which is two levels up in the hierarchy: `regions` -> `nations` -> `suppliers`). We also pass through the necessary fields (`region_name`, `supp_name`, `total_supplier_sales`) to the next stage.
3.  **`top_3_suppliers_per_region`**: This final step filters the ranked suppliers using `WHERE(sales_rank <= 3)` to keep only the top 3 in each region. It then uses `CALCULATE` to select and rename the columns to match the desired output (`region`, `supplier_name`, `total_sales`).

This revised code structure respects the PyDough rule about field availability within `CALCULATE` clauses and correctly implements the logic to find the top 3 suppliers by total sales within each region using the `RANKING` function.","# Step 1: CALCULATE region name, supplier name, and total sales per supplier

    *   Compare these two counts.
    *   Filter customers where the 1995 count is greater than the 1994 count.
    *   Return only the names of these customers.
4.  **PyDough Approach:**
    *   Start with the `customers` collection.
    *   Use `CALCULATE` to compute the order counts for 1994 and 1995 for each customer using `COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == year))`. Also, keep the customer's name.
    *   Use `WHERE` to filter the results based on the comparison (`orders_1995 > orders_1994`).
    *   Use a final `CALCULATE` to select only the customer's name.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
active_customers_1995 = customers.CALCULATE(
    # Count orders specifically for 1994 for this customer
    orders_count_1994=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994)),
    # Count orders specifically for 1995 for this customer
    orders_count_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)),
    # Keep the customer name needed for the final output
    cust_name=name
).WHERE(
    # Filter customers where the 1995 count is strictly greater than the 1994 count
    orders_count_1995 > orders_count_1994
).CALCULATE(
    # Select only the customer name for the final result
    customer_name=cust_name
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `customers` collection. For each customer, we calculate three new fields:
    *   `orders_count_1994`: This counts the number of orders associated with the current customer where the `order_date` falls within the year 1994.
    *   `orders_count_1995`: Similarly, this counts the orders for the year 1995.
    *   `cust_name`: We store the customer's original `name` in a new field `cust_name` to carry it through the query.
2.  **`.WHERE(orders_count_1995 > orders_count_1994)`**: We filter the results from the previous step. Only customers for whom the calculated `orders_count_1995` is strictly greater than `orders_count_1994` are kept.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_name=cust_name)`**: Finally, for the customers who passed the filter, we select only the `cust_name` field and rename it to `customer_name` for the final output, as requested.","active_customers_1995 = customers.CALCULATE(
    # Count orders specifically for 1994 for this customer
    orders_count_1994=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994)),
    # Count orders specifically for 1995 for this customer
    orders_count_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)),
    # Keep the customer name needed for the final output
    cust_name=name

    # Filter customers WHERE the 1995 count is strictly greater than the 1994 count

Which is the average order value per Nation? List the nation name and average order value. The order value is defined as extended_price * quantity,"SELECT n_name AS nation_name, AVG(l_extendedprice * l_quantity) AS average_order_value FROM nation JOIN customer ON n_nationkey = c_nationkey JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey GROUP BY n_name;",,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

1.  **Goal:** Partition `nations` by `name`, then calculate the average order value for each nation.
2.  **Definition:** `average_order_value` = `AVG(extended_price * quantity)`.
3.  **Return:** `nation_name` and `average_order_value`.

**Analysis:**

*   We need to start with the `nations` collection.
*   We need to use `PARTITION` with `name` as the key.
*   Inside the partition's `CALCULATE`, we need to access the `lines` associated with each nation. The path is `nation_group.customers.orders.lines`.
*   The average calculation requires `extended_price * quantity`. This calculation must be done *per line item* before averaging. We'll use an inner `CALCULATE` for this.
*   The outer `CALCULATE` will perform the `AVG` aggregation on the results of the inner calculation.

```python
nation_avg_order_value = PARTITION(nations, name='nation_group', by=name).CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    average_order_value=AVG(
        nation_group.customers.orders.lines.CALCULATE(
            line_total=extended_price * quantity
        ).line_total
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `PARTITION(nations, name='nation_group', by=name)`: This function groups the `nations` collection based on the unique values in the `name` field. Each resulting group (representing a single nation) is accessible within the subsequent `CALCULATE` using the alias `nation_group`.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This method operates on each partition created in the previous step.
    *   `nation_name=name`: Selects the nation's name. Since `name` is the partitioning key, it can be accessed directly without the `nation_group` prefix.
    *   `average_order_value=AVG(...)`: Calculates the average order value for the current nation group.
    *   `nation_group.customers.orders.lines`: Navigates from the current nation group (`nation_group`) through its associated `customers`, their `orders`, and finally to the `lines` (line items) within those orders.
    *   `.CALCULATE(line_total=extended_price * quantity)`: This inner calculation is performed for *each* line item belonging to the current nation. It computes the product of `extended_price` and `quantity` for that line item and assigns it to a temporary field `line_total`.
    *   `.line_total`: This selects the result (`line_total`) from the inner `CALCULATE`.
    *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` aggregation function then calculates the average of all the `line_total` values computed for the line items associated with the current nation.
3.  The final result, assigned to `nation_avg_order_value`, is a collection where each record contains the `nation_name` and its corresponding calculated `average_order_value`.","nation_avg_order_value = PARTITION(nations, name='nation_group', by=name).CALCULATE(

1.  **Filter Lines:** We first need to isolate the line items from the years 1995 and 1996. We also need the `brand` (from the associated `part`) and the `year` (from the associated `order`).
2.  **Partition by Brand:** Group these filtered lines by their `brand`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `line_data_with_brand_year`: This variable first filters the `lines` collection to include only those associated with orders placed in 1995 or 1996 using `WHERE(ISIN(YEAR(order.order_date), (1995, 1996)))`. It then uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `brand_name` (from the related `part`), the `order_year` (from the related `order`), and the `line_quantity`.
2.  `PARTITION(...)`: We partition the prepared `line_data_with_brand_year` collection by `brand_name`. Each partition (`brand_group`) contains all the line data for a specific brand from 1995 and 1996.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Within each partition, we calculate:
    *   `brand`: The brand name (taken directly from the partition key `brand_name`).
    *   `quantity_1995`: The sum of `line_quantity` for lines within the `brand_group` where the `order_year` is 1995, using `SUM(KEEP_IF(...))`.
    *   `quantity_1996`: The sum of `line_quantity` for lines within the `brand_group` where the `order_year` is 1996.
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the `quantity_difference` by subtracting `quantity_1995` from `quantity_1996`. We also carry forward the previously calculated fields (`brand`, `quantity_1995`, `quantity_1996`).
5.  `.WHERE(quantity_difference > 0)`: This filters the results to include only those brands where the quantity sold increased from 1995 to 1996 (i.e., the difference is positive).
6.  `.TOP_K(3, by=quantity_difference.DESC())`: Finally, this selects the top 3 brands from the filtered results, ordered by the `quantity_difference` in descending order (largest positive difference first). The final result includes the `brand`, `quantity_1995`, `quantity_1996`, and `quantity_difference` for these top 3 brands.","# 1. Prepare line data with brand, year, and quantity for relevant years

5.  **`RANKING(by=acctbal.ASC()) <= 30`**: This condition ranks all customers based on their `acctbal` in ascending order (lowest balance gets rank 1). It then filters to include only those customers whose rank is 30 or less (i.e., the 30 customers with the lowest account balances).

1.  **Partition `parts` by `size`**: We start by partitioning the `parts` collection using the `size` field.
2.  **Find the 5 largest part sizes**: After partitioning, we need to identify the partitions corresponding to the 5 largest `size` values. We can achieve this by calculating the `size` for each partition and then using `TOP_K`.
3.  **Access the partitioned collection**: We need to get the actual parts within these top 5 size partitions.
4.  **Rank parts by `retail_price` within each size group**: For the parts belonging to the top 5 sizes, we need to rank them based on their `retail_price` within their respective size group. The highest price should get rank 1.
5.  **Select the top-ranked part**: Filter to keep only the part with rank 1 (the highest `retail_price`) for each of the top 5 sizes.
6.  **Return relevant fields**: Select the size, part identifier (like `key` or `name`), and the `retail_price`.

Here's an alternative, potentially more efficient approach:

1.  Partition `parts` by `size`.
2.  Within each partition (size group), rank the parts by `retail_price` descending.
3.  Filter to keep only the top-ranked part (rank 1) from *each* size group.
4.  From this result (which now contains the most expensive part for *every* size), select the top 5 entries based on the `size` value itself (descending).
5.  Return the required fields.

Let's implement the second approach:

```python
# Partition parts by size and access the parts within each partition
parts_partitioned_by_size = PARTITION(parts, name='parts_in_size_group', by=size).parts_in_size_group

**Explanation:**

1.  `PARTITION(parts, name='parts_in_size_group', by=size).parts_in_size_group`: This partitions the `parts` collection based on the `size` field. The `.parts_in_size_group` accesses the collection of parts belonging to each partition group.
2.  `CALCULATE(...)`: We calculate new fields for each part within its size group:
    *   `part_size=size`: Keep the size value.
    *   `part_key=key`, `part_name=name`: Identify the part.
    *   `price=retail_price`: Store the retail price.
    *   `price_rank_in_size=RANKING(by=retail_price.DESC(), levels=1)`: This is the core ranking step. It ranks parts based on `retail_price` in descending order (`DESC()`). `levels=1` ensures the ranking is performed independently *within each size group* (the immediate parent collection created by the partition).
3.  `WHERE(price_rank_in_size == 1)`: This filters the results to keep only the part with rank 1 (the highest `retail_price`) within each size group.
4.  `TOP_K(5, by=part_size.DESC())`: From the collection of highest-priced parts (one for each size), this selects the top 5 entries based on the `part_size` field in descending order, effectively giving us the most expensive part for each of the 5 largest sizes.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Selects the final desired fields: the size, part key, part name, and its retail price.

",,"Okay, I can help with that. The error `Unrecognized term of graph 'TPCH': 'GRAPH'` indicates that `GRAPH` is not the correct way to reference the top-level context or perform global calculations in this specific PyDough environment. The correct top-level collection is `TPCH`.

Additionally, the original code calculates the *globally* most common part type, whereas the question asks for the most common part type *specific to each supplier region -> customer region pair*. The logic needs to be adjusted to find the most common part type within each pair's context before calculating percentages.

**Explanation of Corrections and Logic:**

1.  **Removed `GRAPH`:** Replaced invalid `GRAPH.CALCULATE` calls with standard operations starting from the `lines` collection or using `PARTITION` correctly. Global calculations, if needed, would typically start from `TPCH.CALCULATE(...)`.
2.  **MCP per Pair:** The logic now correctly identifies the most common part type(s) *within each unique `(supplier_region_name, customer_region_name)` pair* instead of globally.
    *   It first partitions `base_lines` by the supplier/customer region pair (`pair_part_counts`).
    *   Inside this, it calculates the total lines for the pair (`total_lines_in_pair` - the denominator).
    *   It then performs a nested partition by `part_type_name` *within* the pair to get `type_count` for each part type in that specific pair.
3.  **Numerator Calculation (Handling Ties):**
    *   `pair_mcp_data` calculates the `max_count_in_pair` among the part types for that pair.
    *   In a subsequent `CALCULATE` (necessary to use the result of `MAX`), it filters the `part_type_counts` to keep only those matching the `max_count_in_pair`.
    *   It then `SUM`s the `type_count` of these filtered (most common) part types. This sum (`mcp_lines_count_in_pair`) correctly handles ties by including all part types that share the maximum count and serves as the numerator.
4.  **Percentage Calculation:** `pair_percentages` calculates the percentage for each pair using the derived numerator and denominator, employing `IFF` to handle potential division by zero.
5.  **Final Averaging:** `final_average_percentages` partitions the results by `supplier_region_name` and calculates the `AVG` of `percentage_for_pair` for each supplier region, fulfilling the final requirement of the original question.","import datetime

The error `'Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'customers' in graph 'TPCH': 'GRAPH'` arises because the original code tries to reference an intermediate variable (`inactive_customers_in_target_countries`) directly within a `GRAPH.CALCULATE` aggregation. `GRAPH.CALCULATE` operates at the top level and needs to define its data scope internally or access base collections directly.

To fix this, we need to restructure the query to calculate the global average first using `GRAPH.CALCULATE` based on the filtered criteria, and then use that calculated average downstream to filter the customers again before partitioning.

Here is the corrected PyDough code:

```python

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1.  **Global Average Calculation:** The calculation of the average positive account balance (`global_avg_pos_bal`) is now done first using `GRAPH.CALCULATE`. Inside this calculation, we access the `customers` collection directly, calculate the `country_code`, apply the filters (`ISIN`, `HASNOT`, and `acctbal > 0`), and then select the `acctbal` for the `AVG` function. This avoids referencing intermediate variables within `GRAPH.CALCULATE`.
2.  **Downstream Filtering and Partitioning:** The result of `GRAPH.CALCULATE` (`avg_calc`) now contains the `global_avg_pos_bal`. We then use the `PARTITION` function *as a method* applied to `avg_calc`. This allows the `global_avg_pos_bal` value to be available downstream within the `PARTITION`'s data source definition.
3.  **Filtering within Partition Source:** Inside the `PARTITION` function's first argument (the collection to be partitioned), we again filter the `customers` based on `country_code` and `HASNOT(orders)`, but this time the crucial filter is `acctbal > global_avg_pos_bal`, comparing each customer's balance to the globally calculated average.
4.  **Final Aggregation:** The final `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` remains the same, correctly calculating the `customer_count` and `total_balance` for each `country_code` group (`cust_group`).

This revised structure adheres to PyDough's rules for calculating global values and using them in subsequent filtering and partitioning steps.","# Define the list of country codes to include (as strings, matching the output of phone[:2])

1.  **Goal:** Find European customers who placed orders in 1995.
2.  **Output:** Customer name and the count of their 1995 orders.
3.  **Filtering:**
    *   Customer's region must be ""EUROPE"".

4.  **Calculation:** Count the number of orders placed in 1995 for each qualifying customer.
5.  **Sorting:** Sort the results by the number of orders in descending order.

european_customers_1995_orders = customers.WHERE(
    nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""  # Filter customers located in Europe
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers.WHERE(nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"")`: This starts with the `customers` collection and filters it down to only include customers whose associated `nation` belongs to the `region` named ""EUROPE"".
2.  `.CALCULATE(customer_name=name, num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)))`: For each European customer found:
    *   It selects the customer's `name` and assigns it to `customer_name`.
    *   It accesses the customer's `orders` sub-collection.
    *   It filters these `orders` to include only those where the `YEAR` of the `order_date` is 1995.
    *   It then `COUNT`s the remaining orders (those placed in 1995) and assigns this count to `num_orders_1995`.
3.  `.WHERE(num_orders_1995 > 0)`: This filters the results further, keeping only those customers whose calculated `num_orders_1995` is greater than 0, satisfying the requirement that they placed at least one order in that year.
4.  `.ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())`: Finally, it sorts the resulting list of customers based on their `num_orders_1995` count in descending order (highest count first).","european_customers_1995_orders = customers.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by calculating several key metrics for *each* customer:
    *   `cust_key`, `cust_name`: Basic customer identifiers.
    *   `has_order_1996`: A boolean flag set to `True` if the customer has at least one order (`HAS(...)`) placed in the year 1996 (`WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1996)`).
    *   `has_order_1997`: Similar flag for the year 1997.
    *   `total_spent_calc`: The sum (`SUM`) of `total_price` for all orders placed by the customer.
    *   `last_order_date_calc`: The latest (`MAX`) `order_date` among all orders placed by the customer.

2.  **`filtered_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the results from the previous step based on the specified conditions:
    *   `has_order_1996`: Ensures the customer ordered in 1996.
    *   `~has_order_1997`: Ensures the customer did *not* order in 1997 (using the NOT operator `~`).
    *   `(total_spent_calc > 1000)`: Filters for customers whose total spending exceeds $1000.
    *   `PRESENT(last_order_date_calc)`: Ensures that the customer has placed at least one order, so `last_order_date_calc` is not null, which is necessary for the `DATEDIFF` calculation.

3.  **`final_customer_list = filtered_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the customers who passed the filters, we calculate the final required information:
    *   `customer_key`, `customer_name`: Select the customer identifiers.
    *   `total_spent`: Keep the calculated total spending, primarily for sorting.
    *   `months_since_last_order`: Calculates the difference in months (`DATEDIFF(""months"", ...)` ) between the customer's `last_order_date_calc` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`).

4.  **`.ORDER_BY(total_spent.DESC())`**: Sorts the resulting list of customers based on their `total_spent` in descending order (highest first).

5.  **`customers_1996_not_1997_high_spend = final_customer_list`**: Assigns the final, sorted result to the specified variable name.","# CALCULATE customer information including flags for orders in 1996/1997, total spending, and last order date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filtering Setup:** We define boolean expressions for the required filters:
    *   `part_filter`: Selects the part named 'Rosy Black Navajo Cream Sky'.
    *   `supplier_nation_filter`: Selects lines where the supplier's nation is 'CHINA'.
    *   `date_filter`: Selects lines associated with orders placed in February 1996.
    *   `combined_line_filter`: Combines the supplier nation and date filters to apply them efficiently to the line items.

2.  **Part Selection:** We start with the `parts` collection and apply the `part_filter` using `WHERE`.

3.  **Initial Calculation:** Within the first `CALCULATE` applied to the filtered part:
    *   We keep the `part_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount`: We calculate the sum of `extended_price` for the `lines` associated with this part, but only for those lines that satisfy the `combined_line_filter` (supplier in China, order in Feb 1996).
    *   `total_tax_amount`: Similarly, we calculate the sum of `tax` for the same filtered set of lines.
    *   `total_orders_count`: We count the number of distinct orders (`NDISTINCT(order.key)`) involved in these specific sales by applying the `combined_line_filter` to the lines before accessing the order key.

4.  **Final Calculation (SPM):** A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the Selling Profit Margin (SPM):
    *   We retain `part_name`.
    *   `supplier_country`: We explicitly add 'CHINA' as the supplier country, as this was a condition of our query.
    *   `selling_profit_margin`: We apply the SPM formula: `(Total Sales - Total Tax) / Total Sales * 100.0`. We assume ""Commission"" is 0 as it's not available in the schema. The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_sales_amount` might be zero to prevent division errors, returning `0.0` in that scenario. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point division and represent the result as a percentage.
    *   `total_orders_in_period`: We rename `total_orders_count` for clarity, representing the number of distinct orders contributing to the sales in that specific period and context.

5.  **Assignment:** The final result containing the part name, supplier country, calculated SPM, and the count of relevant orders is assigned to the variable `selling_profit_margin_china_feb96`.","# Define the filters for the part name, supplier nation, and date range
