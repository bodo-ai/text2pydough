)","Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Get the count of customers and suppliers for *each* nation.
2.  **Required Data:** Nation name, count of customers per nation, count of suppliers per nation.
3.  **Starting Collection:** `nations` is the most logical starting point, as the aggregation is per nation.
4.  **Relationships:** The `nations` collection has direct relationships (sub-collections) named `customers` and `suppliers`.
5.  **Operation:** For each nation, we need to count the items in its `customers` sub-collection and its `suppliers` sub-collection. The `CALCULATE` function on the `nations` collection is suitable for this, using the `COUNT` aggregation function.
6.  **Sorting:** The final result needs to be ordered alphabetically by nation name. `ORDER_BY` is the function for this.
7.  **Partitioning:** `PARTITION` is not needed here because we are iterating through the `nations` collection and performing calculations directly related to each nation using its sub-collections. We aren't grouping a different collection *by* nation attributes.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Calculate the total number of customers and suppliers for each nation, ordered by nation name.
nation_customer_supplier_counts = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    total_customers=COUNT(customers),
    total_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`nations.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `nations` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to process each nation individually and compute new values or select existing ones.
2.  **`nation_name=name`**: Selects the `name` field from the current nation and assigns it to the output field `nation_name`.
3.  **`total_customers=COUNT(customers)`**: For the current nation, it accesses the `customers` sub-collection (which contains all customers belonging to that nation) and counts the number of records within it. The result is assigned to the output field `total_customers`.
4.  **`total_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)`**: Similarly, for the current nation, it accesses the `suppliers` sub-collection and counts the number of suppliers belonging to that nation. The result is assigned to the output field `total_suppliers`.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())`**: After calculating the counts for all nations, this sorts the resulting collection in ascending order based on the `nation_name` field.","# CALCULATE the total number of customers and suppliers for each nation, ordered by nation name.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 nations based on the total number of orders placed by their customers in 1995.
2.  **Collections:** We need `nations`, `customers` (linked to nations), and `orders` (linked to customers).
3.  **Filtering:** We need to filter the `orders` to only include those placed in the year 1995 (`YEAR(order_date) == 1995`).
4.  **Aggregation:** For each nation, we need to count the number of filtered orders associated with its customers (`COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(...))`).
5.  **Ranking:** We need to select the top 5 nations based on this count in descending order (`TOP_K(5, by=count.DESC())`).
6.  **Output:** The request implies we need the nation names and potentially the order count used for ranking.

**Explanation:**

1.  `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `nations` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute values for each nation.
2.  `nation_name=name`: We select the name of the nation and assign it to the `nation_name` field in the result.
3.  `num_orders_1995=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`:
    *   We access the `customers` associated with each nation.

**Explanation:**

1.  `regions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `regions` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute values for each region.
2.  `region_name=name`: We select the name of the region and assign it to the `region_name` field in the output.
3.  `total_order_value=SUM(...)`: We calculate the total order value for the region. The `SUM` function aggregates values from the nested expression.
4.  `nations.customers.orders`: We navigate down from the region through its nations, customers, and their orders.

1.  **Goal:** Find customer names and their 1995 order count for European customers with `acctbal > 700` who placed at least one order in 1995. Sort by the 1995 order count descending.
2.  **Starting Collection:** We need customer information (`name`, `acctbal`, `nation`) and their orders. The `customers` collection is the best starting point.
3.  **Filtering Conditions:**
    *   Region is Europe: `nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""`
    *   Account balance: `acctbal > 700`
    *   At least one order in 1995: `HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1`
4.  **Calculations:**
    *   Customer Name: `name`
    *   Number of orders in 1995: `COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`
5.  **Sorting:** Order by the calculated number of 1995 orders, descending.

```python

    num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `customers` collection.
2.  We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter customers based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""`: Checks if the customer's nation belongs to the ""EUROPE"" region.
    *   `acctbal > 700`: Checks if the customer's account balance is greater than $700.
    *   `HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1`: Checks if the customer has at least one order placed in the year 1995. It does this by filtering the `orders` sub-collection for the year 1995 and then using `HAS` to see if any records exist.
3.  We then use `CALCULATE` on the filtered customers to:
    *   Select the customer's `name` and assign it to `customer_name`.
    *   Count the number of orders placed specifically in 1995 using `COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))` and assign it to `num_orders_1995`.
4.  Finally, we use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results based on the calculated `num_orders_1995` in descending order (`DESC()`).","# Filter customers based on region, account balance, and having at least one order in 1995
filtered_customers = customers.WHERE(

2.  `.suppliers`: Accesses the `suppliers` associated with each nation.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each supplier:
    *   `supplier_name=name`: Calculates the supplier's name.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PARTITION(parts, name='part_group', by=name)`**: This partitions the `parts` collection based on the unique values in the `name` field. Each partition (`part_group`) contains all part records that share the same name.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition created above.
    *   `part_name=name`: Selects the part name, which is the key used for partitioning.
    *   `num_nations=NDISTINCT(part_group.supply_records.supplier.nation.key)`: For each `part_group` (representing parts with the same name), it navigates through `supply_records` to the `supplier`, then to the supplier's `nation`, and finally accesses the nation's `key`. `NDISTINCT` counts the number of unique nation keys found for the suppliers associated with that part name.
3.  **`.WHERE(num_nations >= 5)`**: This filters the results, keeping only those partitions (part names) where the calculated `num_nations` (the count of distinct supplying nations) is 5 or greater.

3.  `cust_name=name` and `cust_address=address` select the customer's name and address.
4.  `total_green_quantity_1998=SUM(...)` calculates the total quantity.
5.  Inside the `SUM`, we navigate through `orders`, filter them using `WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1998)`, then navigate to `lines`.
6.  We further filter the `lines` using `WHERE(CONTAINS(part.name, 'green'))` to only include items whose associated part name contains 'green'.
7.  `.quantity` specifies that we want to sum the `quantity` field of these filtered line items.
8.  Finally, `.TOP_K(10, by=total_green_quantity_1998.DESC())` selects the 10 customers with the highest calculated `total_green_quantity_1998`, ordered from highest to lowest.","# CALCULATE the total quantity of 'green' parts ordered in 1998 for each customer

**Analysis:**

1.  **Error:** `'Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'lines' in graph 'TPCH': 'customer'`. This error occurs in the first `CALCULATE` block:
    ```python
    line_item_data = customers.orders.lines.CALCULATE(
        mktsegment=customer.mktsegment,  # <-- Problem here
        line_discount=discount
    )
    ```
    The context inside this `CALCULATE` is the `lines` collection. The `lines` collection does *not* have a direct `customer` field. According to the schema, a `line` belongs to an `order`, and an `order` belongs to a `customer`. Therefore, to access the customer's market segment from a line item, the correct path is `order.customer.mktsegment`.

2.  **Original Goal:** Calculate the average discount for orders (specifically, the line items within those orders) grouped by the customer's market segment, sorted descending by the average discount.

3.  **Correction Strategy:**
    *   Modify the first `CALCULATE` to use the correct path: `order.customer.mktsegment`.
    *   Keep the partitioning logic as it correctly groups by the calculated `mktsegment`.
    *   Keep the final aggregation (`AVG`) and sorting (`ORDER_BY`).
    *   It's often more direct to start the query from the collection containing the primary data point being aggregated (in this case, `discount` from `lines`) and calculate related attributes needed for grouping.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
# 1. Start from line items and calculate the associated market segment and the discount.
line_data_with_segment = lines.CALCULATE(
    # Access market segment via the line's order, then the order's customer
    mktsegment=order.customer.mktsegment,
    line_discount=discount  # Get the discount for this line item
)

# 2. Partition the line items by the calculated market segment.
# 3. Calculate the average discount for all line items within each segment.

    average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount)
).ORDER_BY(average_discount.DESC()) # Sort by the calculated average discount
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `line_data_with_segment = lines.CALCULATE(...)`: We start directly with the `lines` collection because the `discount` we need to average is a field here.
    *   `mktsegment=order.customer.mktsegment`: For each line item, we navigate up to its `order`, then to that order's `customer`, and finally retrieve the `mktsegment`. This correctly associates each line item's discount with the relevant market segment.
    *   `line_discount=discount`: We select the `discount` value for the line item.
2.  `PARTITION(line_data_with_segment, name='segment_lines', by=mktsegment)`: This takes the results from the previous step (which is effectively a list of line items, each tagged with its discount and the customer's market segment) and groups them based on the unique values in the `mktsegment` field. Each group (containing all line items for a specific market segment) is accessible via the name `segment_lines`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(market_segment=mktsegment, average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount))`: For each partition (i.e., for each market segment):
    *   `market_segment=mktsegment`: Selects the market segment value (which is the key we partitioned by).
    *   `average_discount=AVG(segment_lines.line_discount)`: Calculates the average of the `line_discount` values for *all* line items belonging to that specific `segment_lines` group (partition).
4.  `.ORDER_BY(average_discount.DESC())`: Sorts the final result (containing market segments and their corresponding average line item discounts) in descending order based on the calculated `average_discount`.","line_item_data = customers.orders.lines.CALCULATE(

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 20 most ordered parts (products) within each customer market segment for the year 1998. Output should be segment, part name, and order count.
2.  **Original Code Logic:**
    *   Filter `lines` for 1998, get `segment`, `part_key`, `part_name`.
    *   `PARTITION` by `segment`, `part_key`, `part_name`.
    *   `CALCULATE` count within each partition group (`order_count`).
    *   `CALCULATE` rank (`segment_rank`) using `RANKING(by=order_count.DESC(), levels=1)`.
    *   `WHERE` rank <= 20.
    *   `CALCULATE` final output fields.
3.  **Error:** `$0.part_key_0`. This type of error often indicates an issue with how a field, especially a key or a field used in partitioning, is being referenced or handled internally by PyDough, potentially after the initial partitioning step.
4.  **Potential Issue:** Using `part_key` directly in the `PARTITION`'s `by` clause might be causing downstream conflicts or unexpected behavior leading to the internal error message. Since the final output and ranking only depend on `part_name` and `order_count` within each `segment`, partitioning by `(segment, part_name)` should be sufficient to group the lines correctly for counting, assuming `part_name` adequately identifies the product for popularity ranking. This avoids using the potentially problematic `part_key` in the partition definition. The `RANKING(levels=1)` should still correctly rank within each `segment` based on the `order_count` calculated for each `part_name`.

**Corrected Code:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **`lines_info_1998`**: Filters the `lines` collection for orders placed in 1998. It calculates the customer's market `segment` and the `part_name`. `part_key` is omitted as it seemed related to the error and isn't strictly necessary for grouping by product name.
2.  **`segment_part_counts`**: Uses `PARTITION` to group the filtered lines. The `by=(segment, part_name)` clause now groups data first by market segment, and then by the part name within that segment. The subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `order_count` for each unique segment-part\_name combination by counting the line items in each partition group (`COUNT(segment_part_group)`). It selects `segment` and `part_name` from the partition keys.
3.  **`ranked_products`**: Takes the result from the previous step (containing each segment-part\_name combination and its total order count for 1998) and adds a rank. `CALCULATE` adds the `segment_rank` field. `RANKING(by=order_count.DESC(), levels=1)` assigns ranks based on `order_count` in descending order. `levels=1` ensures the ranking is performed independently *within* each `segment` (the first partition key).
4.  **`top_20_per_segment`**: Filters the ranked results using `WHERE(segment_rank <= 20)` to keep only the products ranking in the top 20 within their respective market segments based on order count.
5.  **`final_output`**: Uses `CALCULATE` to select the final required columns: `segment`, `part_name`, and `order_count`.","# Step 1: Filter lines from 1998 and retrieve necessary information (segment, part name)

3.  **Filtering:**
    *   Filter `regions` to get only ""EUROPE"".
    *   Filter `orders` to get only those where `YEAR(order_date) == 1995`.
4.  **Aggregation:** For each nation within the ""EUROPE"" region:

**Explanation:**

1.  `regions.WHERE(name == ""EUROPE"")`: This filters the `regions` collection to select only the region named ""EUROPE"".
2.  `.nations`: This accesses the `nations` sub-collection associated with the ""EUROPE"" region.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is applied to each nation within the ""EUROPE"" region.
4.  `nation_name=name`: Selects the name of the current nation and assigns it to the `nation_name` field in the output.
5.  `total_customers=COUNT(customers)`: Counts all customers associated with the current nation using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `customers` sub-collection.
6.  `orders_1995=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: This counts the orders placed in 1995. It accesses the `orders` for all `customers` of the current nation, filters these orders using `WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`, and then counts the remaining orders using `COUNT`.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find customers who placed *more* orders in 1995 compared to 1994.
2.  **Input Data:** We need the `customers` collection and their associated `orders`, specifically the `order_date` for filtering.
3.  **Operations:**
    *   For each customer, count orders placed in 1995.
    *   For each customer, count orders placed in 1994.
    *   Compare these two counts.
    *   Filter customers where the 1995 count is greater than the 1994 count.
4.  **Output:** Return only the `name` of the qualifying customers.

**PyDough Implementation:**

We can achieve this by starting with the `customers` collection, calculating the order counts for each relevant year within a `CALCULATE` clause, then filtering using `WHERE`, and finally selecting just the name with another `CALCULATE`.

```python
# Calculate the number of orders for each customer in 1995 and 1994
customer_order_counts = customers.CALCULATE(
    cust_name=name,  # Keep the name temporarily
    orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)),
    orders_1994=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994))
)

# Filter customers who had more orders in 1995 than in 1994
filtered_customers = customer_order_counts.WHERE(orders_1995 > orders_1994)

# Select only the customer names from the filtered list
more_orders_in_1995 = filtered_customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=cust_name
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_order_counts = customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `customers` collection. For each customer, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `orders_1995`: Counts the number of orders associated with the customer where the `order_date` year is 1995.
    *   `orders_1994`: Counts the number of orders associated with the customer where the `order_date` year is 1994.
    *   `cust_name=name`: It also selects the customer's original `name` and assigns it to `cust_name` so we can use it later.
2.  **`filtered_customers = customer_order_counts.WHERE(orders_1995 > orders_1994)`**: This line takes the result from the previous step (which includes the calculated counts) and filters it. It keeps only those rows (customers) where the value of `orders_1995` is strictly greater than the value of `orders_1994`.
3.  **`more_orders_in_1995 = filtered_customers.CALCULATE(customer_name=cust_name)`**: This final step takes the filtered customers and uses `CALCULATE` again, this time only to select the `cust_name` field (which holds the original customer name) and renames it to `customer_name` as requested in the output description. This ensures only the names of the qualifying customers are returned.","# CALCULATE the number of orders for each customer in 1995 and 1994

1.  **Goal:** Partition the `nations` collection by `name` and calculate the average order value for each nation.
2.  **Definition:** `average_order_value` = `AVG(extended_price * quantity)`.
3.  **Steps:**
    *   Start with the `nations` collection.
    *   Use `PARTITION` with `name` as the key. Let's call the partition group `nation_group`.
    *   Inside the partition's `CALCULATE`, access the nation's name directly (`name`).
    *   To calculate the average order value, we need to:
        *   Navigate from the partition group to the line items: `nation_group.customers.orders.lines`.
        *   Calculate the value per line item: `extended_price * quantity`. We'll do this in a nested `CALCULATE`.
        *   Apply the `AVG` aggregation function to the calculated line item values.
    *   Return the `nation_name` and the calculated `average_order_value`.

```python
# Partition nations by name and calculate the average order value for each nation.
# Average order value is defined as the average of (extended_price * quantity) for all line items within that nation.
nation_avg_order_value = PARTITION(
    nations,
    name='nation_group',  # Name for the partition group
    by=name              # Partition key
).CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,    # Access the partition key directly
    # Calculate the average order value by first calculating the value per line item
    # and then averaging those values across all lines within the nation partition.
    average_order_value=AVG(
        nation_group.customers.orders.lines.CALCULATE(
            line_item_value=extended_price * quantity
        ).line_item_value
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PARTITION(nations, name='nation_group', by=name)`**: This function groups the `nations` collection based on the unique values in the `name` field. Each group (representing a single nation) is accessible within the subsequent `CALCULATE` using the alias `nation_group`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This method operates on each partition created by the `PARTITION` function.
3.  **`nation_name=name`**: Selects the nation's name. Since `name` is the partition key specified in `by=name`, it can be accessed directly without the `nation_group` prefix.
4.  **`average_order_value=AVG(...)`**: Calculates the average order value for the current nation partition.
5.  **`nation_group.customers.orders.lines`**: Navigates from the current nation partition (`nation_group`) through its `customers`, their `orders`, down to the individual `lines` (line items).
6.  **`.CALCULATE(line_item_value=extended_price * quantity)`**: For each line item within the nation, it calculates an intermediate value `line_item_value` by multiplying `extended_price` and `quantity`. This adheres to the rule of performing calculations involving multiple fields within a nested `CALCULATE` before aggregation.
7.  **`.line_item_value`**: Accesses the calculated `line_item_value` for each line item.
8.  **`AVG(...)`**: The `AVG` function then computes the average of all the `line_item_value` results obtained from the nested `CALCULATE`, effectively giving the average order value per nation based on the provided definition.","# PARTITION nations by name and CALCULATE the average order value for each nation.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`line_info`**: This variable first filters the `lines` collection to include only line items whose corresponding order date falls within the years 1995 or 1996 using `WHERE(ISIN(YEAR(order.order_date), (1995, 1996)))`. It then uses `CALCULATE` to create a temporary collection containing the `brand_name` (accessed via `part.brand`), the `quantity` (`qty`), and the `order_year` (extracted using `YEAR(order.order_date)`).
2.  **`brand_yearly_sales`**: This step partitions the `line_info` collection by `brand_name`. For each partition (each unique brand):
    *   It calculates `qty_1995`: the sum of quantities (`brand_lines.qty`) only for records where the `order_year` is 1995, using `SUM(KEEP_IF(..., brand_lines.order_year == 1995))`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0)` ensures that if a brand had no sales in 1995, the quantity is treated as 0 instead of null.
    *   It calculates `qty_1996` similarly for the year 1996.
    *   The result is a collection where each row represents a brand and contains the total quantity sold in 1995 and 1996.
3.  **`top_brand_diffs`**: This final step takes the `brand_yearly_sales` collection and performs another `CALCULATE`:
    *   It keeps the `brand`, `qty_1995`, and `qty_1996` fields.
    *   It calculates a new field `qty_diff` as the difference between `qty_1996` and `qty_1995`.
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=qty_diff.DESC())` selects the top 3 rows (brands) based on the highest `qty_diff` values, sorted in descending order.

",,"Okay, I understand. The error message `'Expected an expression, but received a collection: Partition(...).CALCULATE(...)'` indicates that the result of the inner `PARTITION` (which calculates `part_type_counts`) is being assigned directly to a field within the `CALCULATE` of the `customer_region_analysis`. According to PyDough rules, `CALCULATE` fields must be singular expressions, unless it's the final step returning the collection. While you can use aggregation functions (like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`) on plural sub-collections *within* a `CALCULATE` expression, you cannot assign the raw collection itself to a field.

The fix involves restructuring the calculation so that the aggregation (`MAX` in this case) is applied directly to the result of the inner partition's calculated field, rather than assigning the partition result to an intermediate variable (`part_type_counts`) inside the `CALCULATE`.

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1.  **Restructured Partitioning:** Instead of nesting partitions deeply within `CALCULATE` assignments, the code now first partitions by the `(supplier_region_name, customer_region_name)` pair.
2.  **Direct Aggregation:** Inside the `pair_analysis.CALCULATE`, the `most_common_pt_count` is calculated by directly applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `pt_count` field resulting from the inner `PARTITION` by `part_type`. This avoids assigning the collection result of the inner partition to a variable within the outer `CALCULATE`, resolving the original error.
3.  **Intermediate Calculation:** A second `.CALCULATE` is used on `pair_analysis` to compute `percentage_this_pair`. This is necessary because `most_common_pt_count` and `total_lines_in_pair` need to be computed first before they can be used in the percentage formula.
4.  **Final Grouping and Averaging:** The `pair_analysis` results (containing `supplier_region_name` and `percentage_this_pair`) are then partitioned by `supplier_region_name`, and the `AVG` function is used on the `percentage_this_pair` field for each supplier region group.

This revised structure adheres to PyDough's rules regarding collections and expressions within `CALCULATE` and correctly implements the logic described in the original question.","# 1. Prepare line item data with necessary context and filters

The error `'Unrecognized term of simple table collection 'customers' in graph 'TPCH': 'GRAPH''` occurs because `GRAPH.CALCULATE` is intended for calculations based on the base collections defined in the graph (like `TPCH.customers`, `TPCH.orders`, etc.) *before* significant filtering or transformation has created intermediate, unnamed collections. You cannot directly reference an intermediate variable like `initial_filtered_customers` within `GRAPH.CALCULATE`.

The goal is to calculate the average positive balance *specifically for the group of customers who meet the initial criteria* (target country code, no orders) and then filter *that same group* based on this average.

We can achieve this using the `RELAVG` window function within the context of the initially filtered customers. `RELAVG` calculates the average across rows within the current collection context.

Here is the corrected code:

```python

**Explanation of Corrections:**

1.  **Removed `GRAPH.CALCULATE`:** The problematic `GRAPH.CALCULATE` step used to compute the average was removed.
2.  **Integrated Average Calculation with `RELAVG`:** The average calculation is now done within a `CALCULATE` call on the `initial_filtered_customers` collection using `RELAVG(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0))`. This correctly computes the average positive account balance *only considering the customers already filtered* in the previous step.
3.  **Combined Filtering:** The result of the `RELAVG` calculation (`avg_pos_bal_for_group`) is immediately used in the subsequent `WHERE` clause to filter the customers whose `acctbal` is greater than this specific average.
4.  **Renamed Steps:** The steps were slightly renumbered and renamed for clarity according to the new logic.

This revised code correctly calculates the average for the specific subset of customers and then uses that average to perform the final filtering before partitioning and aggregating, adhering to PyDough syntax and rules.","# Define the target country codes as strings based on the phone prefix

1.  **Goal:** Find customer names and their 1995 order count for customers located in Europe who placed at least one order in 1995. Sort the results by the order count in descending order.
2.  **Collections & Fields:**
    *   `customers`: `name`, `nation`
    *   `nations`: `region`
    *   `regions`: `name`
    *   `orders`: `order_date`
3.  **Filtering:**
    *   Region must be ""EUROPE"" (`customers.nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""`).
    *   Order year must be 1995 (`YEAR(order_date) == 1995`).
    *   Customer must have at least one order in 1995 (Count of 1995 orders > 0).
4.  **Calculation:**
    *   Count the number of orders per customer where the order year is 1995.
5.  **Sorting:**
    *   Sort by the calculated 1995 order count in descending order.

).ORDER_BY(
    num_orders_1995.DESC()  # Sort by the number of 1995 orders, highest first
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers.WHERE(nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"")`: This selects only the customers whose associated nation belongs to the ""EUROPE"" region.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates the required output fields for the filtered European customers.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name and assigns it to the `customer_name` field in the result.
    *   `num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: For each European customer, it accesses their `orders`, filters them to include only those placed in 1995 (`YEAR(order_date) == 1995`), and then counts how many such orders exist, assigning the result to `num_orders_1995`.
3.  `.WHERE(num_orders_1995 > 0)`: This filters the results further, keeping only those customers for whom the calculated `num_orders_1995` is greater than zero, ensuring they placed at least one order in 1995.
4.  `.ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())`: Finally, this sorts the resulting list of customers based on their `num_orders_1995` count in descending order (highest count first).","# Find European customers and count their orders placed in 1995

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_analysis = customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute several intermediate values for each customer without filtering yet.
    *   `c_key=key`, `c_name=name`: Select the customer's key and name, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   `did_order_1996=HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1996)) == 1`: Creates a boolean flag (`True`/`1`) if the customer has at least one order placed in the year 1996.
    *   `did_order_1997=HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1997)) == 1`: Creates a boolean flag (`True`/`1`) if the customer has at least one order placed in the year 1997.
    *   `c_total_spent=SUM(orders.total_price)`: Calculates the sum of `total_price` for all orders associated with the customer.
    *   `c_months_since_last=IFF(...)`: Calculates the number of months between the customer's latest order (`MAX(orders.order_date)`) and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). `IFF(HAS(orders) == 1, ..., None)` ensures this calculation only happens if the customer has orders, preventing errors for customers with no orders (though the `total_spent > 1000` filter would likely exclude them anyway).
2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the results from `customer_analysis` based on the required conditions:
    *   `did_order_1996 == 1`: Keeps only customers who ordered in 1996.
    *   `did_order_1997 == 0`: Keeps only customers who did *not* order in 1997.
    *   `c_total_spent > 1000`: Keeps only customers whose total spending exceeds $1000.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects the final required fields from the filtered results, giving them the desired output names (`customer_key`, `customer_name`, `total_spent`, `months_since_last`).
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(total_spent.DESC())`**: Sorts the final list of customers based on their `total_spent` in descending order (highest spending first).","# CALCULATE intermediate values for each customer

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filtering Lines:** We start with the `lines` collection because it contains the core sales data (`extended_price`, `discount`, `tax`) and links to `parts`, `orders` (for date and customer), and `suppliers` (for supplier nation).
    *   We filter these lines to include only those associated with the part named 'Rosy Black Navajo Cream Sky'.
    *   We further filter based on the customer's nation being 'CHINA' (accessed via `lines.order.customer.nation.name`).
    *   Finally, we filter based on the `order_date` being in February 1996 using `YEAR()` and `MONTH()`.
2.  **Calculating Line Values:** For the filtered lines, we calculate:
    *   `line_revenue`: The revenue generated by the line item after discount (`extended_price * (1 - discount)`).
    *   `line_revenue_after_tax`: The revenue remaining after applying the tax rate (`line_revenue * (1 - tax)`). This represents `Total Sales Amount - Tax` for the line item.
    *   `order_k`: The key of the order, used later to count distinct orders.
    *   `supplier_nation_name`: The name of the nation where the supplier is located.
    *   `part_n`: The name of the part.
3.  **Partitioning:** We use `PARTITION` to group the calculated line data. The grouping is done by `supplier_nation_name` and `part_n`. Since we filtered for a single part name, partitioning by `part_n` ensures the context is maintained, while `supplier_nation_name` allows us to calculate metrics per supplier country, as requested.
4.  **Aggregating per Group:** Within each partition (i.e., for each supplier nation selling the specific part to China in Feb 1996), we calculate:
    *   `total_sales_amount`: The sum of `line_revenue` for all lines in the group.
    *   `total_sales_after_tax`: The sum of `line_revenue_after_tax` for all lines in the group.
    *   `total_orders_count`: The count of distinct `order_k` values within the group, representing the number of unique orders involved.
5.  **Calculating Final SPM:** In the final `CALCULATE`, we compute the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) using the aggregated values:
    *   `SPM = (total_sales_after_tax / total_sales_amount) * 100`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `total_sales_amount` might be zero (to avoid division by zero), setting the SPM to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   The query returns the `part_name`, the `supplier_country`, the calculated `selling_profit_margin`, and the `number_of_orders` associated with that supplier country for the specified criteria.
    *   The definition `(Total Sales Amount - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Sales Amount * 100` was used. Since 'Commission' isn't directly available, it's omitted. `total_sales_after_tax` represents `Total Sales Amount - Tax Amount`.","import datetime
