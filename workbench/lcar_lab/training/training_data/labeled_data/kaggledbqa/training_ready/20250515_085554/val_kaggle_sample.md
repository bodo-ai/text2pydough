# Pydough Training Examples

## Question
which country is kaiga-4 built in?
Database Schema:
{"GeoNuclearData": {"nuclear_power_plants": {"type": "simple_table", "table_path": "main.nuclear_power_plants", "unique_properties": [["Id", "Name", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Country", "Status", "ReactorType", "ReactorModel", "ConstructionStartAt", "OperationalFrom", "OperationalTo", "Capacity", "LastUpdatedAt", "Source"]], "properties": {"Id": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Id", "data_type": "string"}, "Name": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Name", "data_type": "string"}, "Latitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Latitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Longitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Longitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Country": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Country", "data_type": "string"}, "Status": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Status", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorType": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorType", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorModel": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorModel", "data_type": "string"}, "ConstructionStartAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ConstructionStartAt", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalFrom": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalFrom", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalTo": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalTo", "data_type": "string"}, "Capacity": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Capacity", "data_type": "string"}, "LastUpdatedAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "LastUpdatedAt", "data_type": "string"}, "Source": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Source", "data_type": "string"}}}}}

## Answer
1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks for the country in which the nuclear power plant named "Kaiga-4" is built. This requires filtering the `nuclear_power_plants` collection by the `Name` field and then extracting the `Country` field.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
- Start with the `nuclear_power_plants` collection.
- Filter the collection using the `WHERE` clause to find the record where the `Name` is "Kaiga-4".
- Use the `CALCULATE` function to select the `Country` field.

3. **The PyDough code**
```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == "Kaiga-4").CALCULATE(country=Country)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
- `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants`: This specifies the collection to start with.
- `.WHERE(Name == "Kaiga-4")`: This filters the collection to only include the nuclear power plant named "Kaiga-4".
- `.CALCULATE(country=Country)`: This selects the `Country` field from the filtered collection and assigns it to a new field named `country`.

## Pydough Code
```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == "Kaiga-4").CALCULATE(country=Country)
```

## Code Context
# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding Kaiga-4's Country

Based on the provided documentation, I'll explain the Pydough code that answers which country Kaiga-4 is built in.

## The Code

```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == "Kaiga-4").CALCULATE(country=Country)
```

## Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns

### WHERE Operation
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data. While the provided context doesn't explicitly define the WHERE operation, its usage pattern is clear from the examples - it filters collections based on a condition.

### CALCULATE Operation
The `CALCULATE` operation is explicitly documented in the context [4432bad]:
```
"## Calculate

The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments."
```

An example of CALCULATE is shown [4432bad]:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

And another example [4701ea6]:
```python
pydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_name=nations.name))
```

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this data flow:
1. Starts with `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants` - accessing a collection of nuclear power plants
2. Applies `WHERE(Name == "Kaiga-4")` - filters to only the record where the Name equals "Kaiga-4"
3. Applies `CALCULATE(country=Country)` - extracts the Country field and assigns it to a variable named "country"
4. Assigns the result to `country_name`

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations (WHERE followed by CALCULATE) which is a common pattern in Pydough [4432bad, 4701ea6].

2. **Descriptive variable naming**: Using `country_name` clearly indicates what the variable contains [4096242].

3. **Direct field access**: The code directly accesses fields like `Name` and `Country` from the collection [4432bad].

## How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

1. **Operation capitalization**: Operations like WHERE and CALCULATE are capitalized, consistent with Pydough's syntax conventions [4432bad, 4701ea6].

2. **Collection traversal**: The code navigates from a data source (`GeoNuclearData`) to a specific collection (`nuclear_power_plants`), which is a standard Pydough pattern [9ce6d4b].

3. **Field assignment in CALCULATE**: Using the pattern `field_name=Expression` in CALCULATE is consistent with examples [4432bad, 4701ea6].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks "which country is kaiga-4 built in?" The code directly answers this by:

1. Finding the specific nuclear power plant named "Kaiga-4" using the WHERE operation
2. Extracting the country field from that record using CALCULATE
3. Storing the result in a variable called `country_name`

The code effectively translates the natural language question into a precise data query that will return the country where Kaiga-4 is located.

## Key Examples from Search

From [4432bad]:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```
This shows how CALCULATE can be used to extract and rename fields.

From [4701ea6]:
```python
pydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_name=nations.name))
```
This demonstrates using CALCULATE to create new fields from related collections.

From [9ce6d4b]:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(regions.nations))
pydough.to_df(regions.nations)
```
This shows how Pydough handles relationships between collections, which is conceptually similar to how `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants` works in our example.

## Question
which country is kursk-1 in?
Database Schema:
{"GeoNuclearData": {"nuclear_power_plants": {"type": "simple_table", "table_path": "main.nuclear_power_plants", "unique_properties": [["Id", "Name", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Country", "Status", "ReactorType", "ReactorModel", "ConstructionStartAt", "OperationalFrom", "OperationalTo", "Capacity", "LastUpdatedAt", "Source"]], "properties": {"Id": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Id", "data_type": "string"}, "Name": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Name", "data_type": "string"}, "Latitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Latitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Longitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Longitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Country": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Country", "data_type": "string"}, "Status": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Status", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorType": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorType", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorModel": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorModel", "data_type": "string"}, "ConstructionStartAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ConstructionStartAt", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalFrom": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalFrom", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalTo": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalTo", "data_type": "string"}, "Capacity": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Capacity", "data_type": "string"}, "LastUpdatedAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "LastUpdatedAt", "data_type": "string"}, "Source": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Source", "data_type": "string"}}}}}

## Answer
1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks to find the country of the nuclear power plant named "Kursk-1". This requires filtering the `nuclear_power_plants` collection by the `Name` field and then extracting the `Country` field.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   - Start with the `nuclear_power_plants` collection.
   - Filter the collection using the `WHERE` clause to find the record where `Name` is equal to "Kursk-1".
   - Use the `CALCULATE` function to select the `Country` field.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == "Kursk-1").CALCULATE(Country=Country)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants`: This specifies the collection to start with.
   - `.WHERE(Name == "Kursk-1")`: This filters the collection to only include the nuclear power plant named "Kursk-1".
   - `.CALCULATE(Country=Country)`: This selects the `Country` field from the filtered collection and assigns it to a new field also named `Country`. The result will be a collection containing only the country name of the specified nuclear power plant.

## Pydough Code
```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == "Kursk-1").CALCULATE(Country=Country)
```

## Code Context
# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding Kursk-1's Country

I'll explain the Pydough code that answers the question "which country is kursk-1 in?" based on the provided documentation.

## The Code Being Analyzed

```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == "Kursk-1").CALCULATE(Country=Country)
```

## 1. Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns

### WHERE Operation
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data. While the provided context doesn't explicitly define `WHERE`, it's used in multiple examples to filter collections based on conditions:

```python
nation_4 = nations.WHERE(key == 4)
```
[4701ea6]

### CALCULATE Operation
The `CALCULATE` operation is explicitly documented in the context:

> "The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments." [4432bad]

The `CALCULATE` operation allows you to specify which fields to include in the result, potentially with transformations or aliases. For example:

```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```
[4432bad]

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this data flow:
1. Starts with a data source `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants`
2. Filters to only include the record where `Name` equals "Kursk-1" using `WHERE`
3. Uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `Country` field and assign it to `Country` in the result
4. Assigns the final result to the variable `country_name`

This is a common pattern in Pydough where operations are chained together.

## 3. Important Pydough Best Practices

The code demonstrates an important restriction of `CALCULATE` mentioned in the documentation:

> "Each final entry in the operation must be scalar with respect to a current context." [426403e]

Since the `WHERE` clause filters to a single nuclear power plant (Kursk-1), the `Country` field becomes scalar in this context, making this a valid use of `CALCULATE`.

## 4. Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:
- Using uppercase for operations like `WHERE` and `CALCULATE`
- Using chained operations to transform data step by step
- Using meaningful variable names (`country_name`) that reflect the content
- Using the equality operator (`==`) for comparison in filtering conditions

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers "which country is kursk-1 in?" by:
1. Finding the nuclear power plant named "Kursk-1" in the database
2. Extracting the country information from that record
3. Storing the result in a variable called `country_name`

## 6. Key Examples from Search Results

The documentation provides several examples of `CALCULATE` usage:

```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```
[4432bad]

```python
pydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_name=nations.name))
```
[4701ea6]

And examples of comparison operators in `CALCULATE`:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key == 0, key < 0, key != 0, key >= 5)))
```
[3fe092f]

## 7. Key Descriptions from Documentation

The documentation explains that `CALCULATE` takes "a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments" [4432bad].

It also notes an important restriction: "each final entry in the operation must be scalar with respect to a current context" [426403e].

The documentation shows that Pydough can explain operations using `pydough.explain` and `pydough.explain_term` [be71b9e], which could be useful for understanding this code further.

## Question
where is the first bwr type power plant built and located?
Database Schema:
{"GeoNuclearData": {"nuclear_power_plants": {"type": "simple_table", "table_path": "main.nuclear_power_plants", "unique_properties": [["Id", "Name", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Country", "Status", "ReactorType", "ReactorModel", "ConstructionStartAt", "OperationalFrom", "OperationalTo", "Capacity", "LastUpdatedAt", "Source"]], "properties": {"Id": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Id", "data_type": "string"}, "Name": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Name", "data_type": "string"}, "Latitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Latitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Longitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Longitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Country": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Country", "data_type": "string"}, "Status": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Status", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorType": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorType", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorModel": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorModel", "data_type": "string"}, "ConstructionStartAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ConstructionStartAt", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalFrom": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalFrom", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalTo": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalTo", "data_type": "string"}, "Capacity": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Capacity", "data_type": "string"}, "LastUpdatedAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "LastUpdatedAt", "data_type": "string"}, "Source": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Source", "data_type": "string"}}}}}

## Answer
1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks for the location (longitude and latitude) of the first Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) type nuclear power plant. This requires filtering the `nuclear_power_plants` collection by `ReactorType` equal to "BWR" and then finding the minimum `ConstructionStartAt` date. Finally, we need to output the `Longitude` and `Latitude` of that plant.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Filter the `nuclear_power_plants` collection to include only plants with `ReactorType` equal to "BWR".
   - Find the earliest `ConstructionStartAt` date among the filtered plants.
   - Filter the `nuclear_power_plants` collection again to find the plant(s) with `ReactorType` equal to "BWR" and `ConstructionStartAt` equal to the earliest date found in the previous step.
   - Select the `Longitude` and `Latitude` of the plant(s) found in the previous step.

3. **The PyDough code:**

```python
first_bwr_plant = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(ReactorType == "BWR").CALCULATE(ConstructionStartAt=ConstructionStartAt).ORDER_BY(ConstructionStartAt.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=ConstructionStartAt.ASC()).CALCULATE(Longitude=Longitude, Latitude=Latitude)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(ReactorType == "BWR")`: This filters the `nuclear_power_plants` collection, selecting only the plants where the `ReactorType` is "BWR".
   - `.CALCULATE(ConstructionStartAt=ConstructionStartAt)`: This selects the `ConstructionStartAt` field.
   - `.ORDER_BY(ConstructionStartAt.ASC())`: This sorts the filtered plants by the `ConstructionStartAt` date in ascending order to find the earliest construction date.
   - `.TOP_K(1, by=ConstructionStartAt.ASC())`: This selects the top 1 plant with the earliest construction start date.
   - `.CALCULATE(Longitude=Longitude, Latitude=Latitude)`: This selects the `Longitude` and `Latitude` of the first BWR plant.

## Pydough Code
```python
first_bwr_plant = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(ReactorType == "BWR").CALCULATE(ConstructionStartAt=ConstructionStartAt).ORDER_BY(ConstructionStartAt.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=ConstructionStartAt.ASC()).CALCULATE(Longitude=Longitude, Latitude=Latitude)
```

## Code Context
# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding the First BWR Power Plant

I'll analyze the provided Pydough code that answers the question "where is the first bwr type power plant built and located?" based on the available documentation.

## The Code

```python
first_bwr_plant = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(ReactorType == "BWR").CALCULATE(ConstructionStartAt=ConstructionStartAt).ORDER_BY(ConstructionStartAt.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=ConstructionStartAt.ASC()).CALCULATE(Longitude=Longitude, Latitude=Latitude)
```

## 1. Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

### WHERE Function
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter the collection of nuclear power plants. According to the documentation, this is a fundamental operation in Pydough that allows filtering collections based on conditions [4432bad].

### CALCULATE Function
The code uses the `CALCULATE` operation twice. As described in the documentation [4432bad]:

```
The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments.
```

The example in the documentation shows:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

This demonstrates how `CALCULATE` is used to select specific fields from a collection [4432bad].

### ORDER_BY and ASC Functions
The code uses `ORDER_BY(ConstructionStartAt.ASC())` to sort the results by construction start date in ascending order. While the specific documentation for these functions isn't provided in the context, we can infer their purpose from the naming convention.

### TOP_K Function
The `TOP_K(1, by=ConstructionStartAt.ASC())` function is used to select the top record based on the earliest construction start date.

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data transformation pipeline:

1. Start with `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants` collection
2. Filter to only include BWR (Boiling Water Reactor) type plants using `WHERE(ReactorType == "BWR")`
3. Select the construction start date using `CALCULATE(ConstructionStartAt=ConstructionStartAt)`
4. Sort by construction start date in ascending order using `ORDER_BY(ConstructionStartAt.ASC())`
5. Take only the first (earliest) record using `TOP_K(1, by=ConstructionStartAt.ASC())`
6. Finally, select the longitude and latitude coordinates using `CALCULATE(Longitude=Longitude, Latitude=Latitude)`

This creates a pipeline that transforms the data at each step, following Pydough's functional programming approach.

## 3. Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several best practices:

- **Chaining operations**: The code chains multiple operations together in a readable sequence [588dd89, 7b00472].
- **Clear naming**: The variable `first_bwr_plant` clearly indicates what the result represents.
- **Specific filtering**: Using precise conditions to filter data.
- **Selecting only needed fields**: The code uses `CALCULATE` to select only the required fields rather than retrieving all data [4432bad].

## 4. How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

- Using uppercase for Pydough operations like `WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, `ORDER_BY`, and `TOP_K` [4432bad, 588dd89].
- Following the pattern of starting with a collection and applying operations to transform it [7b00472, 3428b88].
- Using chained method calls to create a data processing pipeline.
- Using descriptive variable names that indicate the purpose of the result.

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks "where is the first bwr type power plant built and located?"

The code addresses this by:
1. Filtering for BWR (Boiling Water Reactor) type plants
2. Ordering by construction start date to find the earliest one
3. Selecting the top (first) result
4. Returning the geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude) which answer the "where" part of the question

The result `first_bwr_plant` will contain the longitude and latitude of the first BWR power plant ever built, directly answering the question.

## 6. Key Examples from the Search

From the search results, we can see examples of Pydough operations:

```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

This demonstrates the `CALCULATE` operation [4432bad], which is similar to how it's used in our code.

The documentation also shows how to use `pydough.explain` to understand what Pydough code does [be71b9e, 7b00472]:

```python
print(pydough.explain(nations, verbose=True))
```

While not directly related to our specific code, this shows how Pydough provides tools to understand code behavior.

## 7. Key Descriptions and Definitions

From the documentation:

- "The API `pydough.explain` can also be called on PyDough code to display information about what it logically does." [be71b9e]
- "The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments." [4432bad]
- "PyDough can be used to solve common intermediate problems and quickly iterate between alternative versions." [8520d02]

These descriptions help understand the philosophy and functionality of Pydough, though specific documentation for all the functions used in our code isn't available in the provided context.

## Question
which country has the most capacities of nuclear power plants?
Database Schema:
{"GeoNuclearData": {"nuclear_power_plants": {"type": "simple_table", "table_path": "main.nuclear_power_plants", "unique_properties": [["Id", "Name", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Country", "Status", "ReactorType", "ReactorModel", "ConstructionStartAt", "OperationalFrom", "OperationalTo", "Capacity", "LastUpdatedAt", "Source"]], "properties": {"Id": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Id", "data_type": "string"}, "Name": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Name", "data_type": "string"}, "Latitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Latitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Longitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Longitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Country": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Country", "data_type": "string"}, "Status": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Status", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorType": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorType", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorModel": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorModel", "data_type": "string"}, "ConstructionStartAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ConstructionStartAt", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalFrom": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalFrom", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalTo": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalTo", "data_type": "string"}, "Capacity": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Capacity", "data_type": "string"}, "LastUpdatedAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "LastUpdatedAt", "data_type": "string"}, "Source": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Source", "data_type": "string"}}}}}

## Answer
1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to identify the country that has the highest total capacity from nuclear power plants. This involves aggregating the `Capacity` of all nuclear power plants for each country and then determining which country has the maximum total capacity. The `Capacity` field is specified as a string in the database schema. For the `SUM` function to work correctly, we must assume that these string values represent numbers (e.g., "1200") that the `SUM` function can process.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
    1.  Access the `nuclear_power_plants` collection, which contains data about nuclear power plants, including their `Country` and `Capacity`.
    2.  Group the records by `Country` using the `PARTITION` method. This creates a logical grouping for each country, allowing aggregation within each group.
    3.  For each country group, calculate two fields:
        *   `country_name`: This will store the name of the country from the `Country` field.
        *   `total_country_capacity`: This will store the sum of `Capacity` for all plants within that specific country. The `SUM(nuclear_power_plants.Capacity)` expression achieves this by summing the `Capacity` values from the `nuclear_power_plants` sub-collection available within each partition.
    4.  Use the `TOP_K(1, by=total_country_capacity.DESC())` method to select the single country (record) that has the highest `total_country_capacity`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the highest capacity is ranked first.
    5.  Finally, use `CALCULATE(country_name)` to output only the name of the country that has the most capacity.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
result = nuclear_power_plants.PARTITION(name="country_group", by=(Country)).CALCULATE(
    country_name=Country,
    total_country_capacity=SUM(nuclear_power_plants.Capacity)
).TOP_K(
    1,
    by=total_country_capacity.DESC()
).CALCULATE(country_name)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The PyDough code performs the following operations:
-   `nuclear_power_plants.PARTITION(name="country_group", by=(Country))`: This first accesses the `nuclear_power_plants` collection and then partitions (groups) the data by the `Country` field. Each partition, named `country_group` internally, corresponds to a unique country and contains all nuclear power plant records for that country.
-   `.CALCULATE(country_name=Country, total_country_capacity=SUM(nuclear_power_plants.Capacity))`: For each country partition created in the previous step, this calculates two new attributes:
    -   `country_name`: The name of the country (taken from the `Country` partition key).
    -   `total_country_capacity`: The sum of the `Capacity` for all plants within the current country's partition. It's assumed that the `Capacity` field (a string) contains values that `SUM()` can convert to numbers.
-   `.TOP_K(1, by=total_country_capacity.DESC())`: This takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` (a list of countries with their total capacities) and selects the top 1 record based on `total_country_capacity` in descending order. This effectively finds the country with the highest total capacity.
-   `.CALCULATE(country_name)`: Finally, from the single record selected by `TOP_K`, this selects only the `country_name` attribute, which is the name of the country with the most nuclear power plant capacity. The final output will be a collection with one record and one column: `country_name`.

## Pydough Code
```python
result = nuclear_power_plants.PARTITION(name="country_group", by=(Country)).CALCULATE(
    country_name=Country,
    total_country_capacity=SUM(nuclear_power_plants.Capacity)
).TOP_K(
    1,
    by=total_country_capacity.DESC()
).CALCULATE(country_name)
```

## Code Context
# Explanation of Pydough Code for Nuclear Power Plant Capacity Analysis

## 1. Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

Based on the provided search results, I can explain the key Pydough functions used in the code:

### CALCULATE
The `CALCULATE` operation is a fundamental Pydough function that takes variable arguments to create new expressions [4432bad]. It allows you to:
- Define new columns with custom names
- Perform aggregations on data

From the example in the search results:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```
This shows how `CALCULATE` can be used to select existing columns or create new ones with custom names [4432bad].

### TOP_K
The `TOP_K` operation selects a specific number of records based on a sorting criterion [e243082]. It requires:
- A number specifying how many records to return
- A `by` parameter that defines the sorting order

As explained in the search results:
```
The `by` argument requirements are:
* Anything that can be an expression used in a `CALCULATE` or a `WHERE` can be used a component of a `by`.
* The value in the `by` must end with either `.ASC()` or `.DESC()`
```
[e243082]

### PARTITION
While not explicitly explained in the search results, based on the context and similar operations, `PARTITION` appears to group data by specified columns.

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data transformation pipeline:

1. **Partitioning**: The code starts by partitioning (grouping) nuclear power plants by country
2. **Aggregation**: It calculates the total capacity for each country using `SUM`
3. **Filtering**: It selects the top 1 country based on descending order of total capacity
4. **Final Selection**: It returns just the country name from the result

This pattern of building expressions from smaller components is mentioned as a best practice in Pydough [52e35f8].

## 3. Important Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several best practices:

1. **Building from smaller components**: The code builds the final result through a series of chained operations, which is mentioned as a best practice [52e35f8]:
   > "while building a statement from smaller components is best practice in Pydough..."

2. **Clear naming conventions**: Using descriptive names like `country_name` and `total_country_capacity` makes the code more readable.

3. **Chaining operations**: The code chains multiple operations together in a logical sequence.

## 4. How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

1. **Using proper sorting syntax**: The code uses `.DESC()` for descending order, which is the required syntax for `TOP_K` operations [e243082].

2. **Proper function chaining**: Operations are chained in a logical sequence.

3. **Appropriate naming**: Variables are named descriptively, similar to examples in the search results.

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks "which country has the most capacities of nuclear power plants?"

The code addresses this by:
1. Grouping nuclear power plants by country
2. Calculating the total capacity for each country
3. Selecting the country with the highest total capacity
4. Returning just the name of that country

This is similar to the example in the search results that finds "the top 3 asian countries by the number of orders" [7e40837], but adapted to find the top 1 country by nuclear capacity.

## 6. Key Examples from Search Results

A similar example from the search results shows how to find top countries:

```python
asian_countries_info = asian_countries.CALCULATE(country_name=LOWER(name), total_orders=COUNT(orders_1995))

top_asian_countries = asian_countries_info.TOP_K(3, by=total_orders.DESC())

pydough.to_df(top_asian_countries)
```
[7e40837]

This example demonstrates the same pattern of calculating aggregates and then using `TOP_K` with a descending sort to find the top entries.

## 7. Key Descriptions from Source

From the search results:

"The `by` argument requirements are:
* Anything that can be an expression used in a `CALCULATE` or a `WHERE` can be used a component of a `by`.
* The value in the `by` must end with either `.ASC()` or `.DESC()`" [e243082]

"The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments." [4432bad]

"The structure of the entire logic is shown, but the information being displayed is specifically focused on the last operation (the `TopK` at the bottom of the structure)." [4617018]

## Question
what nuclear reactor model is the most popular?
Database Schema:
{"GeoNuclearData": {"nuclear_power_plants": {"type": "simple_table", "table_path": "main.nuclear_power_plants", "unique_properties": [["Id", "Name", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Country", "Status", "ReactorType", "ReactorModel", "ConstructionStartAt", "OperationalFrom", "OperationalTo", "Capacity", "LastUpdatedAt", "Source"]], "properties": {"Id": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Id", "data_type": "string"}, "Name": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Name", "data_type": "string"}, "Latitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Latitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Longitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Longitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Country": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Country", "data_type": "string"}, "Status": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Status", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorType": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorType", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorModel": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorModel", "data_type": "string"}, "ConstructionStartAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ConstructionStartAt", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalFrom": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalFrom", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalTo": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalTo", "data_type": "string"}, "Capacity": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Capacity", "data_type": "string"}, "LastUpdatedAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "LastUpdatedAt", "data_type": "string"}, "Source": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Source", "data_type": "string"}}}}}

## Answer
1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to identify the nuclear reactor model that appears most frequently in the `nuclear_power_plants` collection. This involves grouping the data by `ReactorModel` and then finding the model with the highest count.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
1.  Access the `nuclear_power_plants` collection.
2.  Group the records by the `ReactorModel` field using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each group (each unique `ReactorModel`), calculate the count of nuclear power plants using `COUNT(nuclear_power_plants)`.
4.  Use `TOP_K(1, by=count_of_models.DESC())` to select the `ReactorModel` with the highest count.
5.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to display only the `ReactorModel`.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
most_popular_model = nuclear_power_plants.PARTITION(name="model_groups", by=(ReactorModel)).CALCULATE(
    reactor_model_name=ReactorModel,
    count_of_models=COUNT(nuclear_power_plants)
).TOP_K(1, by=count_of_models.DESC()).CALCULATE(reactor_model_name=reactor_model_name)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first accesses the `nuclear_power_plants` collection.
It then uses `PARTITION(name="model_groups", by=(ReactorModel))` to group all nuclear power plants based on their `ReactorModel`.
Within each group, `CALCULATE(reactor_model_name=ReactorModel, count_of_models=COUNT(nuclear_power_plants))` calculates the name of the reactor model and the number of plants associated with that model, aliasing the count as `count_of_models`.
Next, `TOP_K(1, by=count_of_models.DESC())` selects the group (i.e., the reactor model) that has the highest `count_of_models`.
Finally, `.CALCULATE(reactor_model_name=reactor_model_name)` selects only the `reactor_model_name` from the result, which represents the most popular reactor model.

## Pydough Code
```python
most_popular_model = nuclear_power_plants.PARTITION(name="model_groups", by=(ReactorModel)).CALCULATE(
    reactor_model_name=ReactorModel,
    count_of_models=COUNT(nuclear_power_plants)
).TOP_K(1, by=count_of_models.DESC()).CALCULATE(reactor_model_name=reactor_model_name)
```

## Code Context
# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding the Most Popular Nuclear Reactor Model

Based on the provided context, I'll explain the Pydough code that answers the question "what nuclear reactor model is the most popular?"

## Code Analysis

```python
most_popular_model = nuclear_power_plants.PARTITION(name="model_groups", by=(ReactorModel)).CALCULATE(
    reactor_model_name=ReactorModel,
    count_of_models=COUNT(nuclear_power_plants)
).TOP_K(1, by=count_of_models.DESC()).CALCULATE(reactor_model_name=reactor_model_name)
```

## 1. Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

The code uses several Pydough functions:

- **PARTITION**: Groups data by a specific attribute [588dd89]
- **CALCULATE**: Creates new expressions/columns in the result [4617018]
- **COUNT**: Aggregates by counting records [4617018]
- **TOP_K**: Selects the top K records based on a sorting criterion [e2ec3eb]
- **DESC()**: Specifies descending order for sorting [4617018]

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a sequential transformation pattern:

1. Starts with the `nuclear_power_plants` collection
2. Groups (partitions) the plants by their reactor model
3. Calculates two values for each group:
   - The reactor model name
   - The count of plants with that model
4. Selects only the top 1 model based on the count (in descending order)
5. Returns the reactor model name of the most frequent model

This pattern is similar to examples shown in the context where `TOP_K` is used to find top entries after grouping and counting [e2ec3eb, 4617018].

## 3. Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several best practices:

- **Building components**: The code builds the solution step by step, which aligns with the Pydough philosophy mentioned in [8520d02]: "building components allows more proportional scaling and more easily modifying the scenario."
- **Naming intermediate results**: Using descriptive names like "model_groups" for the partition [588dd89]
- **Clear data transformations**: Each operation has a clear purpose in the data transformation pipeline [4617018]

## 4. How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

- Using method chaining to build the query step by step [e2ec3eb]
- Using uppercase for Pydough operations (PARTITION, CALCULATE, TOP_K) [e2ec3eb, 4617018]
- Properly naming the result variable (`most_popular_model`) to reflect its purpose
- Using descriptive parameter names in CALCULATE operations [4617018]

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers "what nuclear reactor model is the most popular?" by:

1. Counting the occurrences of each reactor model in the nuclear_power_plants collection
2. Sorting these counts in descending order
3. Taking only the top entry (the most frequent model)
4. Returning the name of that model

This approach is similar to the example in [e2ec3eb] where TOP_K is used to find the top 3 Asian countries by order count.

## 6. Key Examples from Search

The provided context includes a similar example [e2ec3eb]:

```python
top_asian_countries = asian_countries_info.TOP_K(3, by=total_orders.DESC())
```

This example shows how TOP_K is used with DESC() to find the top entries based on a count, which is the same pattern used in our nuclear reactor code [4617018, e2ec3eb].

## 7. Key Descriptions

From [4617018]:
"* The operation is ordering by `total_orders` in descending order, then keeping the top 3 entries."

This describes the same pattern used in our code, where we order by `count_of_models` in descending order and keep the top 1 entry.

From [8520d02]:
"We believe that PyDough is ideal for these types of questions because PyDough can be used to solve common intermediate problems and quickly iterate between alternative versions."

This explains why Pydough is well-suited for answering questions like the one about the most popular nuclear reactor model.

## Question
which country first started using nuclear power plant(s)?
Database Schema:
{"GeoNuclearData": {"nuclear_power_plants": {"type": "simple_table", "table_path": "main.nuclear_power_plants", "unique_properties": [["Id", "Name", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Country", "Status", "ReactorType", "ReactorModel", "ConstructionStartAt", "OperationalFrom", "OperationalTo", "Capacity", "LastUpdatedAt", "Source"]], "properties": {"Id": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Id", "data_type": "string"}, "Name": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Name", "data_type": "string"}, "Latitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Latitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Longitude": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Longitude", "data_type": "string"}, "Country": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Country", "data_type": "string"}, "Status": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Status", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorType": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorType", "data_type": "string"}, "ReactorModel": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ReactorModel", "data_type": "string"}, "ConstructionStartAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "ConstructionStartAt", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalFrom": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalFrom", "data_type": "string"}, "OperationalTo": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "OperationalTo", "data_type": "string"}, "Capacity": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Capacity", "data_type": "string"}, "LastUpdatedAt": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "LastUpdatedAt", "data_type": "string"}, "Source": {"type": "table_column", "column_name": "Source", "data_type": "string"}}}}}

## Answer
1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to identify the country that was the first to have an operational nuclear power plant. This requires finding the nuclear power plant with the earliest "OperationalFrom" date and then extracting its country. We need to handle cases where the "OperationalFrom" date might be missing.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
    1.  Access the `nuclear_power_plants` collection.
    2.  Filter out records where the `OperationalFrom` field is an empty string. This ensures that only plants with a recorded operational start date are considered.
    3.  Use the `TOP_K(1, by=OperationalFrom.ASC())` method to find the single plant record that has the lexicographically smallest (earliest) `OperationalFrom` date. The `OperationalFrom` field is a string, so an ascending sort will find the earliest date assuming a consistent format (e.g., YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD).
    4.  From this earliest record, use the `CALCULATE()` method to select and display the `Country`.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
# Find the country that first started using nuclear power plants.
# This assumes that OperationalFrom is a string that can be lexicographically sorted to find the earliest date,
# and that an empty string indicates a missing or unknown operational start date.
# TOP_K(1, ...) will pick one country if multiple countries' plants started on the same earliest date.
first_country_to_use_nuclear_power = nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(OperationalFrom != "").TOP_K(1, by=OperationalFrom.ASC()).CALCULATE(Country=Country)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
   - `nuclear_power_plants`: This accesses the collection containing data about nuclear power plants.
   - `.WHERE(OperationalFrom != "")`: This filters the collection to include only those plants where the `OperationalFrom` field (indicating the date the plant became operational) is not an empty string. This step is crucial to exclude plants with unknown or unrecorded operational start dates.
   - `.TOP_K(1, by=OperationalFrom.ASC())`: This method sorts the filtered plants by their `OperationalFrom` date in ascending order (`ASC()`) and selects the top 1 record. Since `OperationalFrom` is a string, this effectively finds the plant with the earliest operational start date (assuming standard date string formats like 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYY' which sort correctly lexicographically). If multiple plants share the same earliest date, `TOP_K` will select one of them.
   - `.CALCULATE(Country=Country)`: After identifying the earliest operational plant, this method selects only the `Country` field from that record. The result will be a collection containing a single record with a single field named `Country`, indicating the country that first started using nuclear power.

## Pydough Code
```python
# Find the country that first started using nuclear power plants.
# This assumes that OperationalFrom is a string that can be lexicographically sorted to find the earliest date,
# and that an empty string indicates a missing or unknown operational start date.
# TOP_K(1, ...) will pick one country if multiple countries' plants started on the same earliest date.
first_country_to_use_nuclear_power = nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(OperationalFrom != "").TOP_K(1, by=OperationalFrom.ASC()).CALCULATE(Country=Country)
```

## Code Context
# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding the First Country to Use Nuclear Power Plants

Based on the provided search results, I'll explain the Pydough code that answers which country first started using nuclear power plants.

## Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

The code uses several key Pydough operations:

1. **WHERE** - Filters data based on a condition [38152c8]
   - Used to filter out records where `OperationalFrom` is an empty string

2. **TOP_K** - Selects the top K records based on a sorting criterion [e2ec3eb, 4096242]
   - In this case, TOP_K(1, ...) selects just the first record when sorted by operational date

3. **ASC()** - Specifies ascending sort order [4096242]
   - Used to sort the operational dates from earliest to latest

4. **CALCULATE** - Creates or renames fields in the result [4432bad]
   - Used to ensure the Country field is included in the final output

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data transformation pipeline:

1. Start with the `nuclear_power_plants` collection
2. Filter to include only plants with a non-empty `OperationalFrom` date using `WHERE(OperationalFrom != "")`
3. Sort the filtered plants by `OperationalFrom` in ascending order and select only the first one using `TOP_K(1, by=OperationalFrom.ASC())`
4. Return the `Country` field from this record using `CALCULATE(Country=Country)`

This pattern of chaining operations is consistent with examples in the search results, such as [7e40837]:
```python
asian_countries = nations.WHERE(region.name == "ASIA")
...
asian_countries_info = asian_countries.CALCULATE(country_name=LOWER(name), total_orders=COUNT(orders_1995))
top_asian_countries = asian_countries_info.TOP_K(3, by=total_orders.DESC())
```

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Clear variable naming**: `first_country_to_use_nuclear_power` clearly describes what the result contains [7e40837]

2. **Filtering before sorting**: The code first filters out records with empty dates before sorting, which is more efficient [7e40837]

3. **Chaining operations**: Operations are chained in a logical sequence, making the code concise and readable [e2ec3eb]

4. **Using comments**: The code includes detailed comments explaining assumptions and logic [be71b9e]

## How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

1. Using uppercase for Pydough operations (WHERE, TOP_K, CALCULATE) [4432bad, e2ec3eb]

2. Using method chaining to build the query step by step [7e40837]

3. Using expressions like `OperationalFrom != ""` for filtering conditions [38152c8]

4. Using the pattern `by=field.ASC()` for sorting, similar to examples in the documentation [4096242]

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks "which country first started using nuclear power plant(s)?" The code addresses this by:

1. Filtering out plants with unknown start dates (`OperationalFrom != ""`)
2. Sorting the remaining plants by their operational start date in ascending order
3. Taking only the first (earliest) plant
4. Returning the country of that plant

The code makes the assumption (as noted in the comments) that `OperationalFrom` is a string that can be lexicographically sorted to find the earliest date, and that empty strings indicate missing or unknown dates.

## Key Examples from Search Results

From [e2ec3eb] and [4096242], we see a similar pattern for finding top items:
```python
top_asian_countries = asian_countries_info.TOP_K(3, by=total_orders.DESC())
```

From [4432bad], we see how CALCULATE is used to specify output fields:
```python
nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)
```

From [38152c8], we see examples of boolean operations similar to the filter condition:
```python
nations.CALCULATE((key != 1) & (LENGTH(name) > 5))
```

The code follows the same patterns demonstrated in these examples to create a concise query that answers the original question about which country first started using nuclear power plants.
