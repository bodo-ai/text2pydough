I'll explain the Pydough code that answers the question ""which country is kaiga-4 built in?"" based on the provided documentation.

## The Code

```python
country_name = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Name == ""Kaiga-4"").CALCULATE(country=Country)
```

## Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns

### WHERE Operation
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data. While the provided context doesn't explicitly define the `WHERE` operation, it's clearly used as a filtering mechanism similar to SQL's WHERE clause.

### CALCULATE Operation
The `CALCULATE` operation is explicitly documented in the context [4432bad]:
```
""## Calculate

The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments.""
```

An example of `CALCULATE` is shown [4432bad]:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

Another example [4701ea6]:
```python
pydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_name=nations.name))
```

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this data flow:
1. Starts with `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants` - accessing a collection of nuclear power plants
2. Applies `WHERE(Name == ""Kaiga-4"")` - filters to only the record where the Name equals ""Kaiga-4""
3. Applies `CALCULATE(country=Country)` - extracts the Country field and assigns it to a variable named ""country""
4. Assigns the result to `country_name`

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations together (accessing a collection, filtering, calculating) which is a common pattern in Pydough [e2ec3eb].

2. **Abstraction of joins**: As noted in [9ce6d4b], ""The metadata holds this relationship, effectively abstracting joins away from the developer whenever possible."" The code likely leverages this abstraction when accessing the Country field.

3. **Descriptive variable naming**: The variable `country_name` clearly indicates what data it contains.

## How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

1. **Method chaining**: Operations are chained together in a readable sequence.

2. **Capitalized operations**: Operations like `WHERE` and `CALCULATE` are capitalized, consistent with the examples in the documentation [4432bad].

3. **Keyword arguments in CALCULATE**: Using `country=Country` follows the pattern shown in examples like `nation_name=name` [4432bad].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers ""which country is kaiga-4 built in?"" by:
1. Finding the specific nuclear power plant named ""Kaiga-4"" in the database
2. Extracting the country field from that record
3. Storing the result in a variable called `country_name`

The result stored in `country_name` would be the answer to the question.

## Key Examples from Search Results

From [4432bad], we see how `CALCULATE` is used to extract and rename fields:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

From [4701ea6], we see another example of `CALCULATE`:
```python
pydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_name=nations.name))
```

From [9ce6d4b], we learn that Pydough abstracts joins:
```
""Notice how in the generated SQL we create a join between `region` and `nation`. The metadata holds this relationship, effectively abstracting joins away from the developer whenever possible.""
```"
