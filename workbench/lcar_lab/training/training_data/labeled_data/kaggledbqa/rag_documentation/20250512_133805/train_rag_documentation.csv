Based on the provided documentation, I'll explain the Pydough code that answers the question ""How many operating nuclear stations in France?""

## Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

### WHERE Function
The code uses the `WHERE` function to filter data:
```python
operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE((GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Country == ""France"") & (GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Status == ""Operating""))
```

This pattern follows Pydough conventions for filtering collections. The code uses the `&` operator for logical AND operations instead of Python's built-in `and` keyword, which is consistent with Pydough's limitations mentioned in [6ea103e]:
* ""You cannot use Python's builtin `and`, `or`, `not`, or `in` with PyDough expressions.""

### CALCULATE Function
The code uses the `CALCULATE` operation with a named parameter:
```python
num_operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(num_plants=COUNT(operating_plants_france))
```

According to [4432bad], ""The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments."" This is demonstrated in the example:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

### COUNT Function
The code uses the `COUNT` function to count the number of records in the filtered collection. As shown in [6ea103e]:
```python
# Count can be used on a column for non-null entries or a collection
# for total entries.
print(""\nQ10"")
print(pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(COUNT(nations), COUNT(nations.comment))))
```

This demonstrates that `COUNT` can be used on a collection to count total entries, which is exactly how it's used in our code.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow:

1. It starts with the `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants` collection, which presumably contains information about nuclear power plants globally.

2. It applies a filter using `WHERE` to select only plants that meet two criteria:
   - Located in France (`Country == ""France""`)
   - Currently operating (`Status == ""Operating""`)

3. It stores this filtered collection in the variable `operating_plants_france`.

4. It then uses `CALCULATE` with the `COUNT` function to count the number of plants in this filtered collection.

5. The result is stored in `num_operating_plants_france` with a named parameter `num_plants`.

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Meaningful variable names**: The code uses descriptive variable names like `operating_plants_france` and `num_operating_plants_france` that clearly indicate what data they contain.

2. **Proper use of logical operators**: The code uses `&` instead of Python's `and` as required by Pydough [6ea103e].

3. **Named parameters in CALCULATE**: Using named parameters in the `CALCULATE` function (`num_plants=COUNT(...)`) makes the code more readable and self-documenting [4432bad].

4. **Sequential data transformation**: The code follows a logical sequence of operations: filter first, then calculate, which is a common pattern in data processing.

## How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

1. **Capitalized function names**: Functions like `WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, and `COUNT` are capitalized, following the convention mentioned in [2176fd4]: ""for functions that require regular function call semantics we use all capitalization by convention.""

2. **Collection access pattern**: The code accesses collections and their properties using dot notation, which is consistent with the examples shown throughout the documentation.

3. **Logical operators**: The code uses `&` for logical AND operations instead of Python's built-in `and` keyword, adhering to Pydough's requirements [6ea103e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks ""How many operating nuclear stations in France?"" The code directly answers this by:

1. Filtering nuclear power plants to only those in France with an ""Operating"" status
2. Counting the number of plants that meet these criteria
3. Storing the result in a variable named `num_operating_plants_france`

The result stored in `num_operating_plants_france` would be the answer to the question.

## Evaluation and Execution

Based on [b351124], there are two primary ways to evaluate Pydough expressions:
1. Convert to SQL using `pydough.to_sql()`
2. Execute on a SQL database using `pydough.to_df()`

To see the actual SQL that would be generated or to execute this query against a database, one could use:
```python
pydough.to_sql(num_operating_plants_france)
# or
pydough.to_df(num_operating_plants_france)
```"

num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))","# Explanation of Pydough Code for Nuclear Power Plant Query

## Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

The provided code uses several key Pydough functions and patterns:

1. **WHERE Function**: Used to filter collections based on a condition [7e4f9dc]
   ```python
   shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Status == ""shutdown"")
   ```
   This filters the `nuclear_power_plants` collection to only include records where the `Status` field equals ""shutdown"".

2. **CALCULATE Function**: Used to perform aggregations [4432bad, 6ea103e]
   ```python
   num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))
   ```
   As mentioned in [4432bad], ""The next important operation is the `CALCULATE` operation, which takes in a variable number of positioning and/or keyword arguments.""

3. **COUNT Function**: Used to count records in a collection [6ea103e]
   According to [6ea103e], ""Count can be used on a column for non-null entries or a collection for total entries.""

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow:

1. First, it accesses the `nuclear_power_plants` collection from the `GeoNuclearData` source
2. It then filters this collection using `WHERE` to get only plants with ""shutdown"" status
3. Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` with `COUNT` to count the number of shutdown plants and assigns this value to `number_of_shutdown_plants`

This demonstrates a common pattern in Pydough: filter a collection, then perform calculations on the filtered result.

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several Pydough best practices:

1. **Meaningful variable names**: `shutdown_plants` clearly describes what the variable contains [7e4f9dc]
2. **Breaking complex operations into steps**: First filtering, then counting [6ea103e]
3. **Using named parameters in CALCULATE**: Using `number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants)` makes the output more readable [4432bad]

## How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

1. Using uppercase for Pydough operations like `WHERE` and `CALCULATE` [4432bad, 6ea103e]
2. Using the pattern of filtering collections before aggregating them
3. Using the proper syntax for conditions in `WHERE` clauses
4. Using `COUNT` appropriately on a collection [6ea103e]

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks ""How many nuclear power plants were shut down now?"" The code directly answers this by:

1. Identifying plants with ""shutdown"" status
2. Counting them
3. Storing the result in a variable named `number_of_shutdown_plants`

The result would be the exact count of currently shutdown nuclear power plants in the `GeoNuclearData` database.

## Key Examples from Search Results

From [6ea103e], we can see an example of using COUNT in CALCULATE:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(COUNT(nations), COUNT(nations.comment))))
```

From [4432bad], we see an example of CALCULATE with named parameters:
```python
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)))
```

These examples align with the patterns used in the nuclear power plant query code."
