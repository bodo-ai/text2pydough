I'll explain the provided PyDough code that answers the question ""How many operating nuclear stations in France?"" by analyzing the code structure, functions, and patterns based on the documentation provided.

## Code Analysis

```python
operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE((GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Country == ""France"") & (GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Status == ""Operating""))
num_operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(num_plants=COUNT(operating_plants_france))
```

## 1. PyDough-specific Functions and Patterns

### WHERE Function
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data [eb3ac75]:
```
The `WHERE` operation by be used to filter unwanted entries in a context. For example, we can filter `nations` to only consider the `AMERICA` and `EUROPE` regions. A WHERE's context functions similarly to a `CALCULATE` except that it cannot be used to assign new properties; it only contains a single positional argument: the predicate to filter on.
```

In this case, the code filters nuclear power plants based on two conditions:
- Country equals ""France""
- Status equals ""Operating""

The conditions are combined using the `&` operator, which represents a Boolean AND operation [09e9927]:
```
# Boolean operations
print(""\\nQ4\"")\n"",
print(pydough.to_sql(nations.CALCULATE((key != 1) & (LENGTH(name) > 5)))) # Boolean AND
```

### CALCULATE Function
The `CALCULATE` operation is used to define new fields and perform aggregations [bd8fc50]:
```
Calculate has a few purposes:
* Select which entries you want in the output.
* Define new fields by calling functions.
* Allow operations to be evaluated for each entry in the outermost collection's ""context"".
* Define aliases for terms that get down-streamed to descendants
```

### COUNT Function
The `COUNT` operation is used to count the number of items in a collection [09e9927]:
```
# Count can be used on a column for non-null entries or a collection
# for total entries.
print(""\\nQ10\"")\n
```

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow:

1. First, it accesses the `nuclear_power_plants` collection from the `GeoNuclearData` source
2. It then filters this collection using `WHERE` to get only plants in France with ""Operating"" status
3. This filtered collection is stored in the variable `operating_plants_france`
4. Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` with the `COUNT` function to count the number of plants in this filtered collection
5. The result is stored in `num_operating_plants_france` with the field name `num_plants`

## 3. PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Breaking down complex queries**: The code first creates a filtered collection and then performs calculations on it [bd8fc50]:
   ```
   While building a statement from smaller components is best practice in Pydough, you can always evaluate the entire expression all at once within a PyDough cell
   ```

2. **Using descriptive variable names**: Variables like `operating_plants_france` and `num_operating_plants_france` clearly indicate what they represent.

3. **Using Boolean operators properly**: The code uses `&` instead of Python's built-in `and` operator, which is a PyDough requirement [8b2ba65]:
   ```
   There are a few limitations with regular Python. Most notably:
   * You cannot use Python's builtin `and`, `or`, `not`, or `in` with PyDough expressions.
   ```

## 4. PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions:

1. **Capitalized operation names**: Operations like `WHERE` and `CALCULATE` use all caps [09e9927]:
   ```
   In addition, to avoid namespace conflicts, for functions that require regular function call semantics we use all capitalization by convention.
   ```

2. **Property access notation**: The code uses dot notation to access properties of collections (e.g., `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Country`)

3. **Boolean operators**: Uses `&` instead of `and` as required by PyDough

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers the question ""How many operating nuclear stations in France?"" by:

1. Filtering nuclear power plants to only those in France with ""Operating"" status
2. Counting the number of plants in this filtered collection
3. Storing the count in a variable named `num_plants` within the `num_operating_plants_france` result

The final result would be a single number representing the count of operating nuclear power plants in France.

## Summary

This PyDough code demonstrates a clean, logical approach to answering a specific question about data. It uses PyDough's filtering and aggregation capabilities to extract precisely the information needed, following the language's conventions and best practices for readability and maintainability."

num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))","# Explanation of PyDough Code for Counting Shutdown Nuclear Power Plants

I'll explain the provided PyDough code that answers the question ""How many nuclear power plants were shut down now?"" by analyzing the code structure, functions, and patterns based on the provided documentation.

## The PyDough Code

```python
shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Status == ""shutdown"")
num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))
```

## 1. PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### WHERE Operation
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data [eb3ac75]:
```python
shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Status == ""shutdown"")
```

As explained in the documentation [5be9616e]: ""The `WHERE` operation by be used to filter unwanted entries in a context. [...] A WHERE's context functions similarly to a `CALCULATE` except that it cannot be used to assign new properties; it only contains a single positional argument: the predicate to filter on.""

### CALCULATE Operation
The code uses the `CALCULATE` operation [d86928a1]:
```python
num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))
```

According to the documentation, `CALCULATE` has several purposes:
- Select which entries you want in the output
- Define new fields by calling functions
- Allow operations to be evaluated for each entry in the outermost collection's ""context""
- Define aliases for terms that get down-streamed to descendants

### COUNT Function
The code uses the `COUNT` function to count the number of shutdown plants [8b2ba65]:
```python
COUNT(shutdown_plants)
```

The documentation shows examples of using `COUNT` with collections, such as:
```python
pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(COUNT(nations), COUNT(nations.comment)))
```

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The data flow in this code follows these steps:

1. First, it accesses the `nuclear_power_plants` collection from the `GeoNuclearData` metadata graph
2. It filters this collection to only include plants where the `Status` equals ""shutdown"" using the `WHERE` operation
3. It stores this filtered collection in the variable `shutdown_plants`
4. It then uses the `CALCULATE` operation on the `GeoNuclearData` context to create a new field called `number_of_shutdown_plants`
5. This field is calculated by counting the number of entries in the `shutdown_plants` collection using the `COUNT` function
6. The result is stored in the variable `num_shutdown_plants`

## 3. Important PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Breaking down complex operations**: The code first creates a filtered collection and then performs calculations on it, making the code more readable and maintainable [988171e].

2. **Using descriptive variable names**: Variables like `shutdown_plants` and `number_of_shutdown_plants` clearly indicate what they represent.

3. **Using appropriate operations**: The code uses `WHERE` for filtering and `CALCULATE` for creating new fields, following the intended purpose of these operations [5be9616e].

## 4. How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions in several ways:

1. **Capitalization of PyDough operations**: Operations like `WHERE` and `CALCULATE` are capitalized, following the convention mentioned in [70d2c6b9]: ""for functions that require regular function call semantics we use all capitalization by convention.""

2. **Expression structure**: The code follows the PyDough pattern of starting with a collection (`GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants`) and then applying operations to it.

3. **Naming convention**: The code uses descriptive variable names and follows the convention of using keyword arguments in `CALCULATE` to define new fields.

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks ""How many nuclear power plants were shut down now?"" The code directly addresses this by:

1. Filtering the `nuclear_power_plants` collection to only include those with a status of ""shutdown""
2. Counting the number of plants in this filtered collection
3. Storing the count in a variable called `num_shutdown_plants` with a descriptive field name `number_of_shutdown_plants`

The result stored in `num_shutdown_plants` would be the answer to the original question.

## 6. Key Examples from Search Results

The provided code is similar to examples in the documentation:

From [eb3ac75]:
```python
pydough.to_df(regions.WHERE(HAS(length_10_nations)))
```

From [6b361449]:
```python
pydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_count=COUNT(nations)))
```

These examples show similar patterns of filtering collections with `WHERE` and using `COUNT` within `CALCULATE` to count entries in a collection.

In summary, the provided PyDough code efficiently answers the question about the number of shutdown nuclear power plants by filtering the data and counting the results using PyDough's declarative syntax."
