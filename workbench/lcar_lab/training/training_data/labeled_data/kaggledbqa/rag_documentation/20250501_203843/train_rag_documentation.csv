num_operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(num_plants=COUNT(operating_plants_france))","# Explanation of Pydough Code for Counting Operating Nuclear Stations in France

Let me explain the provided Pydough code that answers the question ""How many operating nuclear stations in France?"":

```python
operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE((GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Country == ""France"") & (GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Status == ""Operating""))
num_operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(num_plants=COUNT(operating_plants_france))
```

## 1. Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

### WHERE Operation
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data [d91e6ab7]. As shown in the documentation, `WHERE` is used to filter unwanted entries in a context:

```python
# Example from documentation
nations.WHERE((region.name == ""AMERICA"") | (region.name == ""EUROPE""))
```

In our code, `WHERE` filters nuclear power plants based on two conditions: country is France AND status is Operating.

### CALCULATE Operation
The `CALCULATE` operation [a25a2965] takes variable arguments and is used to:
- Select which entries to include in output
- Define new fields by calling functions
- Allow operations to be evaluated for each entry in the collection's context

In our code, `CALCULATE` is used to create a new field `num_plants` by counting the filtered plants.

### COUNT Function
`COUNT` is an aggregation function [70d2c6b9] that can be used on:
- A column for non-null entries
- A collection for total entries

In our code, `COUNT` is used on the filtered collection to count the total number of operating nuclear plants in France.

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow:

1. Start with `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants` collection
2. Filter this collection using `WHERE` to get only plants in France with ""Operating"" status
3. Store this filtered collection in `operating_plants_france`
4. Use `CALCULATE` on the base `GeoNuclearData` to create a new field `num_plants`
5. The `num_plants` field counts the entries in the filtered collection
6. Store the result in `num_operating_plants_france`

## 3. Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several best practices:

- **Breaking down complex operations**: The code first filters the data and stores it in an intermediate variable before counting [d47513b], similar to how the documentation shows building statements from smaller components.

- **Clear variable naming**: Variables are named descriptively (`operating_plants_france`, `num_operating_plants_france`).

- **Using appropriate operations**: `WHERE` for filtering and `CALCULATE` with `COUNT` for aggregation [70d2c6b9].

## 4. How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

- Using capitalized operation names (`WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, `COUNT`) [70d2c6b9]
- Using the proper syntax for boolean operations with `&` for AND [70d2c6b9]
- Following the pattern of filtering data before aggregating it [d47513b]
- Using proper property access notation (collection.property)

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers ""How many operating nuclear stations in France?"" by:

1. Filtering nuclear power plants to only those in France with ""Operating"" status
2. Counting the number of plants that meet these criteria
3. Storing the count in `num_operating_plants_france`

The final result in `num_operating_plants_france` contains the answer to the question.

## 6. Key Examples from Documentation

The code structure is similar to examples in the documentation:

- Filtering with `WHERE` [d91e6ab7]:
  ```python
  nations.WHERE((region.name == ""AMERICA"") | (region.name == ""EUROPE""))
  ```

- Using `CALCULATE` [a25a2965]:
  ```python
  nations.CALCULATE(key, nation_name=name)
  ```

- Using `COUNT` [80c9a0e]:
  ```python
  print(pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(COUNT(nations), COUNT(nations.comment))))
  ```

## 7. Key Code Blocks and Definitions

### WHERE Operation
`WHERE` is used to filter data based on conditions [d91e6ab7]:
```python
# From our code
operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(
    (GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Country == ""France"") & 
    (GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.Status == ""Operating"")
)
```

### CALCULATE Operation
`CALCULATE` is used to define new fields [a25a2965]:
```python
# From our code
num_operating_plants_france = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(
    num_plants=COUNT(operating_plants_france)
)
```

### COUNT Function
`COUNT` is used to count entries in a collection [70d2c6b9]:
```python
# From our code
COUNT(operating_plants_france)
```

The code effectively uses Pydough's data manipulation capabilities to filter and count nuclear power plants, providing a clear answer to the original question."

num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))","# Explanation of Pydough Code for Counting Shutdown Nuclear Power Plants

## Overview of the Code

The Pydough code answers the question ""How many nuclear power plants were shut down now?"" by:

```python
shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Status == ""shutdown"")
num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))
```

## Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### 1. WHERE Operation
The code uses the `WHERE` operation to filter data based on a condition [5b05681]:
```python
shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants.WHERE(Status == ""shutdown"")
```

The `WHERE` operation filters unwanted entries in a context based on a predicate. As explained in [5b05681]: ""The `WHERE` operation by be used to filter unwanted entries in a context. For example, we can filter `nations` to only consider the `AMERICA` and `EUROPE` regions.""

### 2. COUNT Function
The code uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of items in a collection [8b2ba65]:
```python
num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))
```

COUNT is an aggregation function that counts the number of items in a collection, as demonstrated in examples like [8b2ba65] where it's used in expressions like `COUNT(nations)`.

### 3. CALCULATE Operation
The code uses the `CALCULATE` operation to define new properties [4daea60]:
```python
num_shutdown_plants = GeoNuclearData.CALCULATE(number_of_shutdown_plants=COUNT(shutdown_plants))
```

As shown in [4daea60], `CALCULATE` is used to define new properties or terms. In this example, it's defining a new property called `number_of_shutdown_plants` that contains the count of shutdown plants.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flow in this code follows a clear two-step process:

1. First, it filters the nuclear power plants collection to only include those with a status of ""shutdown"" [5b05681].
2. Then, it counts the number of plants in this filtered collection and assigns this count to a new property called `number_of_shutdown_plants` [8b2ba65].

This pattern of filtering data and then performing aggregations on the filtered data is common in Pydough, as seen in examples like [c9997c6] where filtering is done before counting or calculating other metrics.

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several Pydough best practices:

1. **Clear variable naming**: The variables `shutdown_plants` and `num_shutdown_plants` clearly indicate what they represent [4daea60].

2. **Separation of concerns**: The code first filters the data, then performs the aggregation, making the logic easy to follow [5b05681].

3. **Using appropriate operations**: The code uses `WHERE` for filtering and `CALCULATE` with `COUNT` for aggregation, which are the appropriate operations for these tasks [5b05681, 8b2ba65].

## How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

1. Using the dot notation to access properties and collections (e.g., `GeoNuclearData.nuclear_power_plants`) [4daea60].

2. Using the `WHERE` operation with a condition expression to filter data [5b05681].

3. Using the `CALCULATE` operation to define new properties with meaningful names [4daea60].

4. Using aggregation functions like `COUNT` to perform calculations on collections [8b2ba65].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks ""How many nuclear power plants were shut down now?"" The code directly addresses this by:

1. Identifying nuclear power plants with a status of ""shutdown"" [5b05681].
2. Counting how many such plants exist [8b2ba65].
3. Storing this count in a variable called `number_of_shutdown_plants` [4daea60].

The result stored in `num_shutdown_plants` provides the exact answer to the question - the number of nuclear power plants that are currently shut down.

## Similar Examples from the Search Results

A similar pattern can be seen in [c9997c6] where filtering and counting are used to analyze data:

```python
customer_info = customers.CALCULATE(
    # Filtering and calculating metrics
)
```

Another example is in [f0418a5] where a `WHERE` condition is used to filter data before further processing:

```python
where_node = builder.build_where(nations_sub_collection, [])
where_node = where_node.with_condition(condition)
```

In [4404147], we see a similar pattern of filtering and then performing operations on the filtered data:

```python
output = suppliers.CALCULATE(
  S_NAME=name,
  S_ADDRESS=address,
).WHERE((nation.name == ""CANADA"") & COUNT(selected_part_supplied) > 0).ORDER_BY(S_NAME.ASC())
```

These examples demonstrate that the approach used in the code is consistent with common Pydough patterns for filtering and aggregating data."
