It creates a new collection where each record represents a unique combination of the partitioning terms, along with a sub-collection that maps back to the original data.\n\nThe syntax for PARTITION is:\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\nWhere:\n- `data` is the collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is the name used to access the partitioned data\n- `by` is the partitioning key(s) [fcc80aa]\n\n### Accessing Partitioned Data\n\nWhen you need to access the partitioned data within a `CALCULATE` after a `PARTITION`, you must use the name specified in the `name` parameter of the `PARTITION` operation [fcc80aa].\n\n## How to Access Plural Values After PARTITION\n\nAccording to the documentation [fcc80aa], when you partition a collection, you can access the original data through the name specified in the `name` parameter. This creates a sub-collection that you can then use in your `CALCULATE` operations.\n\n### Example from Documentation\n\nHere's a key example from the documentation [fcc80aa]:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. `Addresses` collection is partitioned by `state`\n2. The partitioned data is accessible via the name `addrs`\n3. In the `CALCULATE` operation, `COUNT(addrs)` is used to count the number of addresses in each partition\n\n### Another Example with Multiple Partition Keys\n\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    city,\n    n_people=COUNT(addrs.current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\nIn this example [fcc80aa]:\n1. `Addresses` is partitioned by both `city` and `state`\n2. The partitioned data is accessible via `addrs`\n3. The `CALCULATE` accesses a sub-collection of the partitioned data using `addrs.current_occupants`\n\n## Important Rules and Best Practices\n\n1. **Name Access**: You must use the name specified in the `name` parameter to access the partitioned data [fcc80aa].\n\n2. **Down-Streaming**: When a term is defined inside a `CALCULATE` call, it's available to all descendants of the current context using the same name [e67e9de].\n\n3. **Partition Keys Limitations**: PyDough only supports using references to scalar expressions from the data collection itself as partition keys, not ancestor terms, terms from child collections, or function call results [fcc80aa].\n\n4. **Ancestry**: When partitioned data is accessed, its original ancestry is lost. It inherits ancestry from the `PARTITION` clause instead [fcc80aa].\n\n5. **Aggregation Functions**: When accessing plural values within a `CALCULATE`, you typically need to use aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc. to make them singular with respect to the current context [e67e9de].\n\n## Example of Correct Usage\n\nFrom the documentation [fcc80aa], here's how to find the top 5 years with the most people born in that year who have yahoo email accounts:\n\n```python\nyahoo_people = People.CALCULATE(\n    birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)\n).WHERE(ENDSWITH(email, \"@yahoo.com\"))\n\nPARTITION(yahoo_people, name=\"yah_ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    n_people=COUNT(yah_ppl)\n).TOP_K(5, by=n_people.DESC())\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. First, we prepare the data by calculating birth years and filtering for yahoo emails\n2. Then we partition by birth year with the name \"yah_ppl\"\n3. In the `CALCULATE`, we access the partitioned data using the name \"yah_ppl\"\n4. We use `COUNT(yah_ppl)` to count the number of people in each partition\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo access plural values or sub-collections within a `CALCULATE` applied after a `PARTITION`:\n\n1. Use the name specified in the `name` parameter of the `PARTITION` operation\n2. Apply appropriate aggregation functions when needed to make plural values singular\n3. Follow the ancestry rules, understanding that partitioned data inherits ancestry from the `PARTITION` clause\n4. Be aware of the limitations on partition keys\n\nThis approach allows you to perform complex analytical operations on grouped data while maintaining the hierarchical thinking model that PyDough promotes."}]}]}

The search results contain information about PyDough's general functionality, metadata structure, operators, and various examples, but there is no direct reference to an `ISIN` function.\n\n## What We Know About PyDough Functions\n\nFrom the search results, we can see that PyDough has a variety of built-in functions and operators:\n\n1. PyDough has a registry of operators [8b38c51] that includes arithmetic, logical, and aggregation functions.\n\n2. There is a documentation file for PyDough functions mentioned in [7ea5a7b]: \"List of builtin PyDough functions (https://github.com/bodo-ai/PyDough/blob/main/documentation/functions.md)\"\n\n3. PyDough supports various operations like `WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, `TOP_K`, etc. as shown in examples [a10c3db] and [8e03891].\n\n4. PyDough has a test that verifies all functions in the operator registry are documented [c77b4ad].\n\n## Possible Interpretation\n\nWhile I cannot provide specific documentation for the `ISIN` function, based on the naming convention and common programming patterns:\n\n- `ISIN` likely checks if a value (`val`) is contained within a collection or range (represented by `(x, y)`).\n- The function name suggests it might be similar to SQL's `IN` operator or Python's `in` keyword.\n- The syntax `ISIN(val, (x, y))` suggests it might check if `val` is in the tuple `(x, y)`.\n\nHowever, without specific documentation from the search results, I cannot confirm the exact behavior, parameters, or return value of the `ISIN` function in PyDough.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo get accurate information about the `ISIN` function in PyDough, I would recommend:\n\n1. Consulting the official PyDough documentation, specifically the functions.md file mentioned in the search results\n2. Looking at example code that uses the `ISIN` function\n3. Using PyDough's exploration APIs like `pydough.explain_term` to get information about the function [da99528]\n\nI cannot provide a definitive answer about how the `ISIN(val, (x, y))` function works based on the search results provided."}]}]}

This means you cannot use values like 2, 3, or -1 for the step parameter in PyDough string slicing.\n\n2. **Start parameter**: The `start` parameter must be either a non-negative value or omitted. This means you cannot use negative indices to count from the end of the string for the start position.\n\n3. **Stop parameter**: The `stop` parameter must be either a non-negative value or omitted. This means you cannot use negative indices to count from the end of the string for the stop position.\n\nHowever, there appears to be an inconsistency in the documentation, as earlier in the same section [8431c97], it states:\n\n> The implementation is based on Python slicing semantics. PyDough supports negative slicing, but currently, it does not support providing step values other than 1.\n\nAnd the examples provided include negative slicing:\n\n```py\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    country_code = phone[:3],\n    name_without_first_char = name[1:],\n    last_digit = phone[-1:],\n    name_without_start_and_end_char = name[1:-1]\n    phone_without_last_5_chars = phone[:-5]\n    name_second_to_last_char = name[-2:-1]\n)\n```\n\nThis suggests that while the documentation has a warning about not supporting negative indices, the examples show that negative indices are actually supported in practice. The only consistent limitation across both statements is that the `step` parameter must be either 1 or omitted.\n\nIn summary, based on the documentation:\n- The `step` parameter is limited to either 1 or being omitted\n- There's conflicting information about whether negative indices are supported for `start` and `stop` parameters, though the examples suggest they are supported"}]}]}

We start with the `Nations` collection, which contains multiple nations\n2. We access the `customers` subcollection for each nation\n3. The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on a condition\n4. The condition `acctbal > RELAVG(acctbal, levels=1)` compares:\n   - Each customer's account balance (`acctbal`)\n   - Against the average account balance of all customers within the same nation (`RELAVG(acctbal, levels=1)`)\n\nThe `levels=1` parameter is crucial here - it specifies that the average should be calculated at one level up in the hierarchy (the Nation level) rather than globally across all customers.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThis example demonstrates several PyDough best practices:\n\n1. **Hierarchical thinking**: The code leverages PyDough's hierarchical model (Nations \u2192 customers) to express the relationship between entities [988171e]\n\n2. **Concise expression**: The solution is expressed in a single, readable line that clearly communicates the intent\n\n3. **Proper use of window functions**: The `RELAVG` function with the `levels` parameter correctly establishes the context for the average calculation\n\n4. **Intuitive filtering**: The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on a comparison with an aggregated value\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe example directly addresses the original question by:\n\n1. Establishing the Nations context as the grouping level\n2. Calculating the average balance within each Nation group\n3. Comparing each customer's balance against their Nation's average\n4. Returning only those customers whose balance exceeds their Nation's average\n\nThis approach is much more concise and intuitive than the equivalent SQL, which would require subqueries or window functions to achieve the same result.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe PyDough approach aligns with the framework's philosophy of expressing \"analytical questions with hierarchical thinking\" [988171e], making it easier to express relationships between entities like Nations and customers in a way that's closer to human linguistic patterns than traditional relational models."}]}]}

The exception to this is when [they are] made singular with regards to [the parent collection] by aggregating it.\"\n\nThis means aggregation functions allow you to work with data from sub-collections that would otherwise be inaccessible because they contain multiple values per parent record.\n\n## Specific Aggregation Functions\n\n### SUM\n\nFrom [4766684]:\n> \"The `SUM` function returns the sum of the plural set of numerical values it is called on.\"\n\nExample:\n```py\nNations.CALCULATE(total_consumer_wealth = SUM(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\n### AVG\n\nFrom [4766684]:\n> \"The `AVG` function takes the average of the plural set of numerical values it is called on.\"\n\n### COUNT\n\nWhile not explicitly defined in the provided snippets, `COUNT` is referenced in multiple examples as an aggregation function that counts the number of records in a collection.\n\nExample from [988171e]:\n```py\nresult = People.CALCULATE(\n    name,\n    net_income = SUM(jobs.income_earned) - SUM(schools.tuition_paid)\n)\n```\n\n## Return Type Behavior\n\nThe documentation [d0f966d] provides important information about the return type behavior of aggregation functions:\n\n1. For `SUM`:\n   > \"`sum_default_zero` (default=True): if True, then `SUM` will always return `0` instead of `NULL` when there are no records to be summed (e.g. summing over an empty sub-collection). If False, then the behavior will depend on the database being used to execute (though this nearly always means returning `NULL`).\"\n\n2. For `AVG`:\n   > \"`avg_default_zero` (default=False): if True, then `AVG` will always return `0` instead of `NULL` when there are no records to be summed (e.g. taking the average from an empty sub-collection). If False, then the behavior will depend on the database being used to execute (though this nearly always means returning `NULL`).\"\n\nThis means the return type of these aggregation functions is numeric, but the handling of empty collections can be configured.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices\n\nThe documentation demonstrates several best practices:\n\n1. Using aggregation functions to convert plural sub-collection data into singular values that can be used in calculations [4766684]\n2. Configuring the behavior of aggregation functions through session settings [d0f966d]\n3. Using aggregation functions in combination with other operations [988171e]\n\n## Example Usage\n\nFrom [988171e], a complete example showing how aggregation functions are used in a real query:\n\n```py\nresult = People.CALCULATE(\n    name,\n    net_income = SUM(jobs.income_earned) - SUM(schools.tuition_paid)\n)\npydough.to_df(result)\n```\n\nThis example shows how `SUM` returns numeric values that can be used in arithmetic operations.\n\nIn summary, aggregation functions in PyDough return numeric values (the specific type depends on the input data), with special handling for empty collections that can be configured through session settings."}]}]}
{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "You are an analytics expert and a proficient Pydough generator that creates Python code based on natural language descriptions."}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "Why might you define a contextless expression even for a simple filter condition?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "# Why Define a Contextless Expression for a Simple Filter Condition in PyDough\n\nBased on the provided documentation, I'll explain why you might define a contextless expression even for a simple filter condition in PyDough.\n\n## What is a Contextless Expression?\n\nA contextless expression in PyDough is a fundamental building block that allows for code reusability and composability [23d4d72]. It's an expression defined outside of any specific context that can later be applied to different contexts as needed.\n\nAs explained in the documentation:\n\n> \"This might seem shocking. We have defined `revenue_def` out of nowhere using an `extended_price` and `discount`. What has actually happened here is that we have generated what is called a `Contextless Expression`. This fundamental building block is the key to PyDough's composability.\" [23d4d72]\n\n## Benefits of Using Contextless Expressions\n\n### 1. Reusability Across Different Contexts\n\nThe primary benefit of defining a contextless expression is that it can be reused in multiple different contexts [23d4d72]. For example, a filter condition defined once can be applied to different collections or in different parts of your query.\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\n> \"This might seem very minor, but this allows us to define definitions up front, allowing reuse in vastly different contexts.\" [23d4d72]\n\n### 2. Incremental Development and Testing\n\nPyDough allows for incremental development where expressions can be defined and tested independently before being combined into a complete query [a10c3db]:\n\n> \"PyDough can be written incrementally via expressions that are meaningless until the final context.\" [a10c3db]\n\nThis approach makes it easier to verify the correctness of individual components:\n\n> \"To ask is this statement correct, we can instead compose our question to ask:\n> * Is this underlying expression correct?\n> * Is this context correct?\" [23d4d72]\n\n### 3. Simplifies Complex Queries\n\nFor complex queries, breaking down the logic into reusable contextless expressions makes the code more manageable and easier to understand [23d4d72].\n\n## Example from Documentation\n\nHere's a concrete example from the documentation showing how a contextless expression is defined and then used in different contexts:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\n\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\n```\n\nThis expression doesn't mean anything on its own [23d4d72]. However, it can be used in different contexts:\n\n1. To compute total revenue across all lines:\n```python\n%%pydough\n\ntotal_revenue = SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_revenue=revenue_def).line_revenue)\npydough.to_df(TPCH.CALCULATE(total_line_revenue=total_revenue))\n```\n\n2. To compute revenue for each order:\n```python\n%%pydough\n\norder_total_price = orders.CALCULATE(order_revenue=total_revenue)\npydough.to_df(order_total_price)\n```\n\nThe documentation explains:\n\n> \"Notice that are able to reuse the exact same code, but by swapping the context we can ultimately modify the semantics. This makes testing the underlying behavior much more scalable.\" [23d4d72]\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\n1. **Define reusable expressions**: Create contextless expressions for common calculations or filter conditions that will be used multiple times [23d4d72].\n\n2. **Compose complex queries incrementally**: Build up complex queries by combining simpler, well-tested components [0e98bac].\n\n3. **Test components independently**: Verify the correctness of individual expressions before combining them into a complete query [23d4d72].\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nDefining a contextless expression even for a simple filter condition provides several advantages:\n\n1. It allows for reuse of the filter condition across different parts of your query or in different queries entirely.\n\n2. It makes your code more maintainable by separating the definition of the condition from its application.\n\n3. It facilitates testing by allowing you to verify the correctness of the filter condition independently.\n\n4. It makes your code more readable by giving meaningful names to filter conditions.\n\n5. It supports a \"WHAT-IF\" analysis approach where you can quickly modify and test different scenarios [0e98bac].\n\nIn summary, contextless expressions in PyDough, even for simple filter conditions, promote code reusability, maintainability, testability, and readability, making them a valuable tool for writing effective PyDough queries."}]}]}

It can be used to count non-null rows globally or per an ancestor of a sub-collection.\n\n## Function Syntax and Parameters\n\nFrom the documentation [0a7d61d], `RELCOUNT` takes the following arguments:\n\n```python\nRELCOUNT(expression, levels=None)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `expression`: the singular expression to count the number of non-null entries across multiple rows.\n- `levels` (optional): optional argument (default `None`) for the same `levels` argument as all other window functions.\n\n## Example Scenarios\n\nThe documentation provides two key examples of using `RELCOUNT` [0a7d61d]:\n\n### Example 1: Global Ratio Calculation\n```python\n# Divides each customer's account balance by the total number of positive\n# account balances globally.\nCustomers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELCOUNT(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0.0)))\n```\n\nIn this example, `RELCOUNT` is used to count all customers with a positive account balance across the entire dataset. Each customer's account balance is then divided by this count to calculate a ratio.\n\n### Example 2: Group-Based Ratio Calculation\n```python\n# Divides each customer's account balance by the total number of positive\n# account balances in the same nation.\nNations.customers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELCOUNT(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0.0), levels=1))\n```\n\nIn this example, `RELCOUNT` is used with `levels=1` to count customers with positive account balances within each nation. Each customer's account balance is then divided by the count of positive balances in their nation.\n\n## How RELCOUNT Addresses Conditional Counting Within Groups\n\nThe `RELCOUNT` function is particularly useful for calculating ratios based on conditional counts within groups because:\n\n1. It can be combined with conditional expressions (like `KEEP_IF`) to count only records that meet specific criteria [0a7d61d]\n2. It supports the `levels` parameter to specify the grouping level for the count [0a7d61d]\n3. It handles non-null values automatically, making it robust for real-world data scenarios\n\n## Comparison with Related Functions\n\nThe documentation also mentions a related function called `RELSIZE` [0a7d61d], which returns the total number of records (regardless of null values) either globally or per ancestor collection. This provides context for when to use `RELCOUNT` versus `RELSIZE`:\n\n- Use `RELCOUNT` when you need to count non-null values that meet specific conditions\n- Use `RELSIZE` when you need to count all records regardless of their values\n\n## PyDough Patterns and Best Practices\n\nThe examples demonstrate several PyDough patterns:\n\n1. Using `CALCULATE` to define new derived fields [988171e]\n2. Combining functions like `KEEP_IF` with `RELCOUNT` to create conditional counts\n3. Using the `levels` parameter to control the grouping context for window functions\n4. Creating ratio calculations by dividing a value by a count\n\nThese examples follow PyDough conventions by using the hierarchical thinking approach mentioned in the documentation [988171e], which allows for more intuitive data analysis compared to traditional SQL approaches."}]}]}

It allows for:\n\n1. Writing code that is interleaved with Python\n2. Lazy evaluation (only executes when requested)\n3. Translation of logic into SQL for database execution\n\n## Recommended Approach for Complex Calculations\n\n### 1. Use Contextless Expressions for Composability\n\nPyDough allows defining expressions that can be reused across different contexts:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\n```\n\nAs shown in [0e98bac], this \"Contextless Expression\" is a fundamental building block for PyDough's composability. On its own, this expression doesn't mean anything, but it can be used in various calculations.\n\n### 2. Apply the CALCULATE Method for Transformations\n\nThe `CALCULATE` method is the primary way to express transformations in PyDough [e67e9de]:\n\n```python\n# Basic calculation\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    full_name=first_name + \" \" + last_name\n)\n\n# Referencing scalar properties of a singular sub-collection\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    current_state=current_address.state\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Use WHERE for Filtering\n\nWhile not explicitly shown in a code block, filtering is done using the `WHERE` method in PyDough, which allows you to specify conditions to filter collections.\n\n### 4. Apply Aggregation Functions for Summarizing Data\n\nPyDough provides various aggregation functions [e67e9de]:\n\n```python\n# Invoking aggregation functions on plural data\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages),\n    home_has_had_packages_billed=HAS(current_address.billed_packages),\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.package_cost),\n    n_states_shipped_to=NDISTINCT(packages.shipping_address.state),\n    most_recent_package_ordered=MAX(packages.order_date)\n)\n```\n\n### 5. Chain Operations for Complex Calculations\n\nFor complex calculations, PyDough allows chaining operations [8e03891]:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nThis example shows how to:\n1. Define a reusable expression\n2. Calculate aggregations at different levels\n3. Reference calculated values from parent contexts\n4. Sort and limit results\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\n### 1. Down-Streaming\n\nWhen an expression is defined inside a `CALCULATE` call, it's available to all descendants using the same name [e67e9de]. However:\n\n- Avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections\n- Only names placed in a `CALCULATE` are available to descendant terms\n- It's acceptable to create a term with a name conflict if it's a no-op assignment\n\n### 2. Incremental Development\n\nPyDough encourages building complex queries incrementally [0e98bac]:\n- Define reusable expressions\n- Build components that can be combined\n- This allows for more proportional scaling and easier modification\n\n### 3. Avoid Explicit Joins\n\nUnlike SQL, PyDough abstracts away joins in favor of thinking about logical relationships between collections and sub-collections [7ea5a7b]. This makes the code more intuitive and closer to the natural language question.\n\n## Comparison with SQL\n\nPyDough offers significant advantages over SQL for complex calculations [988171e, 8e03891]:\n\n```sql\nSelect\n (L_EXTENDED_PRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) / order_total as revenue_ratio,\n orderkey,\n l_linenumber as line_number\nfrom lines\ninner join (\n select\n o_orderkey as order_key,\n SUM(L_EXTENDED_PRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as order_total\n from orders\n inner join lines\n on l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n group by o_orderkey\n)\non l_orderkey = order_key\norder by revenue_ratio ASC, order_key DESC, line_number DESC\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nVersus the equivalent PyDough:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nThe PyDough version is more concise and avoids explicit join information, which is encoded in the metadata [8e03891].\n\n## Summary\n\nThe recommended approach in PyDough for complex calculations involves:\n1. Defining reusable contextless expressions\n2. Using CALCULATE for transformations\n3. Applying WHERE for filtering\n4. Using aggregation functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG\n5. Chaining operations in a logical sequence\n6. Leveraging the hierarchical document model to avoid explicit joins\n7. Following down-streaming conventions for referencing values across contexts\n\nThis approach makes PyDough code more intuitive, concise, and closer to natural language than equivalent SQL queries."}]}]}

It's specifically used in filtering operations to determine if a relationship contains any data.\n\nAs shown in example [aed8f9e], the `HAS` function is used in a `WHERE` clause to filter records based on whether a related collection contains any data:\n\n```python\nAddresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants))\n```\n\nThis example filters the `Addresses` collection to only include addresses that have at least one occupant (i.e., the `current_occupants` sub-collection is not empty).\n\n## Usage Pattern in PyDough\n\nThe `HAS` function is typically used within a `WHERE` clause to filter collections based on the existence of related records. This is a common pattern when working with relationships between tables in PyDough.\n\nFor example, in [aed8f9e], the full example shows:\n\n```python\nAddresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants)).CALCULATE(\n  city,\n  state,\n  n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants),\n).BEST(\n  current_occupants.CALCULATE(n_orders=COUNT(packages)),\n  by=(n_orders.DESC(), ssn.ASC())\n).CALCULATE(\n  first_name,\n  last_name,\n  n_orders,\n  n_living_in_same_addr=n_occupants,\n  city=city,\n  state=state,\n)\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Starts with the `Addresses` collection\n2. Filters to only include addresses that have occupants using `WHERE(HAS(current_occupants))`\n3. Calculates city, state, and the number of occupants\n4. Finds the \"best\" occupant (the one who ordered the most packages)\n5. Calculates additional information about that occupant\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using the `HAS` function, the data flow follows this pattern:\n1. The collection is filtered to only include records where the related sub-collection has at least one record\n2. This filtered collection can then be further processed with other PyDough operations\n\nThe transformation is essentially a filtering operation that checks for the existence of related records.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices\n\nThe example in [aed8f9e] demonstrates a best practice of using `HAS` to avoid processing records that don't have the necessary related data. By filtering early in the query chain, subsequent operations only need to process relevant records.\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe use of `HAS` follows PyDough's convention of providing intuitive, readable functions that abstract away complex SQL operations. In SQL, checking for the existence of related records would typically require a subquery or join with an EXISTS clause. PyDough simplifies this with the `HAS` function.\n\n## Addressing the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about the specific purpose of the `HAS` function in relation to table relationships. Based on the provided context, the `HAS` function is used to check whether a relationship (represented as a sub-collection in PyDough) contains any records. This is particularly useful when filtering records based on whether they have related data in another table.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nPyDough allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking [988171e], which makes functions like `HAS` particularly useful for working with related data. The hierarchical model in PyDough is designed to be closer to human linguistics than a relational model, making it more intuitive to express conditions like \"addresses that have occupants\" using `HAS(current_occupants)`."}]}]}

This allows you to compute global metrics across the entire dataset.\n\nAs shown in example [d2c25f0], you can use the special `GRAPH` reference to apply calculations at the graph level:\n\n```python\nGRAPH.CALCULATE(n_cases=SUM(package_info.is_shipped_to_current_addr))\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can directly reference the graph by name as shown in [23d4d72]:\n\n```python\nTPCH.CALCULATE(total_line_revenue=total_revenue)\n```\n\n## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns\n\n1. **Global Aggregation**: When `CALCULATE` is applied to the graph, it performs aggregation across the entire dataset [91a43fe]:\n   ```python\n   print(pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(NDISTINCT(nations.comment), SUM(nations.key))))\n   ```\n\n2. **Contextual Evaluation**: The graph provides the highest-level context for evaluation, allowing access to all collections within it [988171e].\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen `CALCULATE` is applied to the graph:\n\n1. The expressions inside `CALCULATE` are evaluated in the context of the entire graph\n2. Aggregation functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `NDISTINCT` operate across all records in the specified collections\n3. The result is a single row containing the calculated values [23d4d72]\n\nFor example, in [23d4d72], the following code calculates the total revenue across all line items:\n```python\npydough.to_df(TPCH.CALCULATE(total_line_revenue=total_revenue))\n```\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\n1. **Using Graph-Level Calculations for Global Metrics**: As shown in [91a43fe], applying `CALCULATE` to the graph is appropriate for computing global metrics:\n   ```python\n   TPCH.CALCULATE(COUNT(nations), COUNT(nations.comment))\n   ```\n\n2. **Reusing Expressions**: The documentation shows how expressions can be defined once and reused in different contexts, including at the graph level [23d4d72].\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe use of `CALCULATE` at the graph level follows PyDough's hierarchical thinking model [988171e], where operations can be applied at any level of the data hierarchy, from individual records to the entire graph.\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about applying `CALCULATE` directly on the graph itself. The documentation shows that:\n\n1. It's a valid operation in PyDough\n2. It produces global aggregations across the entire dataset\n3. It returns a single row with the calculated values\n4. It can be used with various aggregation functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `NDISTINCT`\n\n## Key Examples from the Documentation\n\nFrom [91a43fe]:\n```python\n# Aggregation operations\nprint(\"\\\\nQ9\")\nprint(pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(NDISTINCT(nations.comment), SUM(nations.key))))\n# Count can be used on a column for non-null entries or a collection\n# for total entries.\nprint(\"\\\\nQ10\")\nprint(pydough.to_sql(TPCH.CALCULATE(COUNT(nations), COUNT(nations.comment))))\n```\n\nFrom [23d4d72]:\n```python\npydough.to_df(TPCH.CALCULATE(total_line_revenue=total_revenue))\n```\n\nFrom [d2c25f0]:\n```python\nGRAPH.CALCULATE(n_cases=SUM(package_info.is_shipped_to_current_addr))\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate that applying `CALCULATE` directly to the graph is a standard pattern in PyDough for computing global metrics across the entire dataset."}]}]}

The syntax is:\n\n```\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of one or more partitioning keys\n\n## Why the Email Property Reference is Invalid\n\nThe specific Bad Example #1 [7330190] is described as:\n\n> **Bad Example #7**: Partition people by their birth year to find the number of people born in each year. Invalid because the `email` property is referenced, which is not one of the partition keys, even though the data being partitioned does have an `email` property.\n\nThe key issue is that when using PARTITION, only the partitioning keys (specified in the `by` parameter) are preserved in the resulting collection. In this example:\n\n1. The original collection `People` is first transformed with `CALCULATE(birth_year=YEAR(birth_date))`\n2. This collection is then partitioned by `birth_year` using `PARTITION(..., by=birth_year)`\n3. The resulting partitioned collection only has access to the `birth_year` property (the partitioning key)\n4. The attempt to reference `email` in the subsequent `CALCULATE` is invalid because `email` is not one of the partition keys\n\n## PyDough Data Flow and Best Practices\n\nThe data flow in PARTITION operations works as follows:\n\n1. The original collection is processed (optionally with CALCULATE or other operations)\n2. The PARTITION operation groups records by the specified key(s)\n3. Each unique combination of values for those keys corresponds to a single record in the new collection\n4. Only the partitioning keys are preserved in the resulting collection\n\nA best practice demonstrated here is that when using PARTITION, you should only reference:\n- The partitioning keys specified in the `by` parameter\n- The name of the partitioned collection (in this case `ppl`) for aggregation operations like COUNT\n\n## Correct Usage Example\n\nFor comparison, here's a valid example from the documentation [7330190]:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\n\nPARTITION(People, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\nThis example works because it only references:\n1. `state` - which is the partitioning key\n2. `addrs` - which is the name given to the partitioned collection for aggregation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe invalid example attempts to access the `email` property which is not preserved during the PARTITION operation because it wasn't specified as a partitioning key. Only the properties specified in the `by` parameter (in this case `birth_year`) are accessible in the resulting partitioned collection, along with the ability to aggregate over the partitioned data using the specified name (`ppl`)."}]}]}

This pattern allows for calculating aggregates at a higher level and then accessing those aggregates at a lower level.\n\n## Key Functions and Patterns\n\nThe primary pattern involves:\n\n1. Using `CALCULATE` at a higher/parent level to compute the aggregate\n2. Using another `CALCULATE` at a lower/child level to compare individual values against the aggregated value\n3. Leveraging PyDough's \"down-streaming\" capability to make aggregated values available to descendant collections\n\n## Example from Source\n\nA clear example of this pattern is shown in [79d3c82], where PyDough compares package costs to the average package cost for a customer:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- First, `CALCULATE` computes `avg_package_cost` at the customer level using the aggregation function `AVG`\n- Then, at the packages level, another `CALCULATE` compares each individual package's `cost` to the `avg_package_cost` from the parent level\n- The result is a boolean field `is_above_avg` that indicates whether each package's cost is above the customer's average\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in this pattern follows these steps:\n1. Aggregate values are calculated at a higher level (e.g., department, customer)\n2. These aggregate values are made available to lower levels through down-streaming\n3. Individual records at the lower level can then be compared against these aggregates\n4. The comparison results in new calculated fields at the individual record level\n\n## Another Example: Query 17\n\nIn [880905f], we see a more complex example from TPC-H Query 17:\n\n```python\nselected_lines = parts.WHERE(\n    (brand == \"Brand#23\") & (container == \"MED BOX\")\n).CALCULATE(\n    avg_quantity=AVG(lines.quantity)\n).lines.WHERE(quantity < 0.2 * avg_quantity)\n```\n\nThis example:\n1. Filters parts by brand and container\n2. Calculates the average quantity for each part's lines\n3. Then filters lines where the quantity is less than 20% of the average quantity for that part\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe examples demonstrate these PyDough best practices:\n1. Using `CALCULATE` to create named expressions that can be referenced later\n2. Leveraging the hierarchical nature of data to compute aggregates at appropriate levels\n3. Using down-streaming to make aggregated values available to descendant collections\n4. Creating clear, readable code that expresses the business logic directly\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThis pattern follows PyDough conventions by:\n1. Using the `CALCULATE` function to define new expressions\n2. Using aggregation functions like `AVG`, `SUM`, etc. to compute group-level statistics\n3. Leveraging the hierarchical document model to express relationships between entities\n4. Following the down-streaming pattern to make parent-level calculations available to children\n\n## Addressing the Original Question\n\nThe original question asks about comparing individual records against aggregates calculated over a group. The answer is that PyDough uses the down-streaming pattern with `CALCULATE` at different levels, combined with aggregation functions like `AVG`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, etc. This allows for elegant and intuitive expression of such comparisons without requiring complex subqueries or joins as would be needed in SQL.\n\nThe key is that PyDough's hierarchical model and down-streaming capability make it natural to express these kinds of comparisons, which would typically require correlated subqueries in SQL."}]}]}

Define a revenue or value expression (often using multiplication) [8e03891]\n2. Calculate the total for each subgroup using SUM and CALCULATE [23d4d72]\n3. Calculate the ratio of individual items to their group total [c681fcf]\n\nA clear example from the search results shows this pattern in the \"what-if\" analysis notebook [0e98bac], where they calculate the ratio of line item revenue to total order revenue:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe search results demonstrate several PyDough best practices:\n\n1. **Define reusable expressions** - Creating contextless expressions like `revenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)` that can be reused in different contexts [23d4d72]\n\n2. **Composable building blocks** - Breaking down complex calculations into smaller, verifiable components [23d4d72]:\n   > \"Since these can be verify independently, we can develop greater confidence in our question since it arises from composable building blocks.\"\n\n3. **Hierarchical thinking** - Using the document model to express relationships naturally [988171e]\n\n## PyDough Conventions\n\nThe solution follows PyDough conventions by:\n\n1. Using the logical document model to represent relationships between entities (like orders and line items) [988171e]\n2. Using CALCULATE to define new properties [0e98bac]\n3. Using ratio expressions for percentage calculations [c681fcf]\n4. Leveraging the hierarchical nature of the data (orders containing lines) [0e98bac]\n\n## Addressing the Original Question\n\nThe original question asks about calculating percentages within subgroups. The search results show a concrete example of this in [8e03891] and [c681fcf], where they calculate the ratio of a line item's revenue to the total order revenue:\n\n```python\nratio = revenue_def / order_revenue\n```\n\nThis is exactly the pattern needed to calculate \"percentage of sales for a product within its category\" as mentioned in the original question.\n\n## Key Example from Search Results\n\nThe most relevant example from the search results is from the \"what-if\" analysis notebook [0e98bac], which demonstrates calculating the percentage of each line item's revenue within an order:\n\n```python\n# Define revenue calculation\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\n\n# Calculate total revenue per order\norder_total_price = orders.CALCULATE(order_revenue=total_revenue)\n\n# Calculate ratio (percentage) of each line item to its order total\nline_ratios = order_total_price.lines.CALCULATE(revenue_ratio=ratio, order_key=order_key, line_number=line_number)\n```\n\nThis pattern can be adapted to calculate the percentage of sales for a product within its category by replacing orders with categories and lines with products."}]}]}

Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\"\n\nThe syntax for PARTITION is:\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\nWhere:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of 1+ partitioning keys\n\n## Why PARTITION Might Be Used Twice\n\nWhile the specific \"Ticker Symbol Monthly Stats\" example isn't directly shown in the provided context, we can understand why PARTITION might be used twice based on examples in the documentation:\n\n### Multi-level Partitioning\n\nIn [c9997c6], there are several examples of multi-level partitioning, including:\n\n```python\ndef multi_partition_access_2()\n# Identify transactions that are below the average number of shares for\n# transactions of the same combinations of (customer, stock, type), or\n# the same combination of (customer, stock), or the same customer.\ncust_tick_typ_groups = PARTITION(\ncust_tick_groups = PARTITION(\ncus_groups = PARTITION(cust_tick_groups, name=\"ticks\", by=customer_id).CALCULATE(\n```\n\nThis shows that PARTITION can be used multiple times to create hierarchical groupings of data.\n\n### Hierarchical Aggregation\n\nThe most likely reason for using PARTITION twice would be to perform hierarchical aggregations at different levels. For example, in [7b73db5], there's an example that first partitions by year/month and then performs calculations:\n\n```python\npackage_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_year=YEAR(order_date), order_month=MONTH(order_date))\n\nPARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n).packs.WHERE(\n    package_cost < avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\n## Specific Example for Ticker Symbol Monthly Stats\n\nBased on the context, a likely scenario for using PARTITION twice in a ticker symbol monthly stats example would be:\n\n1. First PARTITION: Group ticker data by symbol to get symbol-level statistics\n2. Second PARTITION: Further group each symbol's data by month to get monthly statistics for each symbol\n\nThis approach allows for hierarchical aggregation - first at the symbol level, then at the monthly level within each symbol.\n\nA conceptual example might look like:\n\n```python\n# First partition by ticker symbol\nsymbol_groups = PARTITION(Tickers, name=\"ticker_data\", by=symbol)\n\n# Second partition by month within each symbol\nmonthly_stats = PARTITION(symbol_groups.ticker_data, name=\"monthly_data\", by=month).CALCULATE(\n    symbol,\n    month,\n    avg_price=AVG(monthly_data.price),\n    volume=SUM(monthly_data.volume)\n)\n```\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe documentation [7330190] shows several best practices when using PARTITION:\n\n1. Using CALCULATE before PARTITION to prepare data:\n   ```python\n   package_info = Packages.CALCULATE(\n       order_year=YEAR(order_date),\n       shipping_state=shipping_address.state\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. Accessing partitioned data using the provided name:\n   ```python\n   PARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=shipping_state).WHERE(\n       COUNT(packs) > 10000\n   ).packs.WHERE(\n       package_cost < avg_cost\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. Downstream access to ancestor terms:\n   ```python\n   PARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n       avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n   ).packs.WHERE(\n       package_cost < avg_package_cost\n   )\n   ```\n\nIn conclusion, using PARTITION twice in the Ticker Symbol Monthly Stats example likely enables hierarchical grouping and aggregation - first by symbol and then by month - allowing for complex multi-level analysis of ticker data."}]}]}

The search results don't contain explicit documentation about year-over-year calculation conventions in PyDough.\n\nHowever, I can provide information about PyDough's date/time functions and patterns that would likely be used in such calculations, based on the available context:\n\n## PyDough Date/Time Functions\n\nPyDough supports several date-related functions that would be relevant for year-over-year calculations:\n\n- `YEAR(date)`: Extracts the year component from a date [09e9927]\n- `MONTH(date)`: Extracts the month component from a date [09e9927]\n- `DAY(date)`: Extracts the day component from a date [09e9927]\n- `HOUR(date)`, `MINUTE(date)`, `SECOND(date)`: Extract time components [09e9927]\n\nFrom the example in [09e9927]:\n```python\nprint(pydough.to_sql(lines.CALCULATE(YEAR(ship_date), MONTH(ship_date), DAY(ship_date),HOUR(ship_date),MINUTE(ship_date),SECOND(ship_date))))\n```\n\n## Relevant PyDough Patterns\n\nFor year-over-year calculations, several PyDough patterns would likely be used:\n\n1. **Filtering by year**: As shown in [4c0de5f], you can filter data by year:\n```python\ncustomers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)\n```\n\n2. **Partitioning by time periods**: The `PARTITION` function allows grouping data by time components [8ad9c9f]:\n```python\n# Example from documentation showing partitioning by year\nyear_info = PARTITION(\n    package_info,\n    name=\"packs\",\n    by=year,\n).CALCULATE(\n    year,\n    pct_trans_coastal=100.0 * SUM(packs.is_trans_coastal) / COUNT(packs),\n)\n```\n\n3. **Aggregation functions**: PyDough supports aggregation functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` that would be used in year-over-year calculations [09e9927].\n\n## Best Practices for Time-Based Analysis\n\nWhile not specific to year-over-year calculations, the search results demonstrate some best practices for time-based analysis in PyDough:\n\n1. **Define contextless expressions** for reusability [8e03891]:\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\n```\n\n2. **Use CALCULATE with aggregation functions** to compute metrics over time periods [8ad9c9f]:\n```python\nCALCULATE(\n    year,\n    pct_trans_coastal=100.0 * SUM(packs.is_trans_coastal) / COUNT(packs),\n)\n```\n\n3. **Use ORDER_BY for time-based sorting** [8ad9c9f]:\n```python\nresult = year_info.ORDER_BY(year.ASC())\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the search results don't provide a specific convention for \"year over year\" calculations when years aren't specified, PyDough provides the necessary date functions, filtering capabilities, and aggregation functions to implement such calculations. A typical approach would likely involve partitioning data by year, calculating metrics for each year, and then computing the differences or ratios between consecutive years.\n\nFor a definitive answer on PyDough conventions for unspecified year-over-year calculations, additional documentation would be needed."}]}]}

However, based on the search results, the relevant example appears to be **Bad Example #6** (not Bad Example #1), which is a variant of Good Example #8.\n\n## The Core Issue\n\nAccording to [7330190], the core issue in Bad Example #6 is that the code attempts to use `state` and `first_name[:1]` as partition terms without first making them available through a `CALCULATE` operation. The documentation explicitly states:\n\n> **Bad Example #6**: Invalid version of good example #8 that did not use a `CALCULATE` to make `state` available via down-streaming or to bind `first_name[:1]` to a name, therefore neither can be used as a partition term.\n\n```py\n%%pydough\n\nPARTITION(Addresses.current_occupants, name=\"ppl\", by=(state, first_name[:1])).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    first_name[:1],\n    n_people=COUNT(ppl),\n).TOP_K(10, by=n_people.DESC())\n```\n\n## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns\n\nThe example demonstrates several PyDough-specific concepts:\n\n1. **PARTITION operation** [7330190]: Used to create a new collection by partitioning records based on specific terms. The syntax is `PARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)`.\n\n2. **Down-streaming** [7330190]: A mechanism where properties defined in an ancestor collection are made available to descendant collections.\n\n3. **CALCULATE** [7330190]: An operation that creates new properties or makes existing ones available for downstream operations.\n\n4. **COUNT** [7330190]: An aggregation function that counts records in a collection.\n\n5. **TOP_K** [7330190]: An operation that returns the top K records based on specified criteria.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nIn the invalid example [7330190], the code attempts to:\n\n1. Take `Addresses.current_occupants` (people living at addresses)\n2. Partition them by `state` and the first letter of their first name (`first_name[:1]`)\n3. Calculate counts for each partition\n4. Return the top 10 partitions by count\n\nThe problem is that neither `state` nor `first_name[:1]` are directly available for partitioning because they haven't been properly prepared through a `CALCULATE` operation.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe documentation [7330190] highlights an important best practice:\n\n> PyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys, not an ancestor term, or a term from a child collection, or the result of a function call.\n\nThis means that before using expressions as partition keys, they must be:\n1. Made available through a `CALCULATE` operation\n2. Bound to a name if they involve operations like slicing (`first_name[:1]`)\n\n## The Correct Approach\n\nThe documentation [7330190] provides Good Example #8, which correctly implements the intended functionality:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\n\npeople_info = Addresses.CALCULATE(state).current_occupants.CALCULATE(\n    first_letter=first_name[:1],\n)\n\nPARTITION(people_info, name=\"ppl\", by=(state, first_letter)).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    first_letter,\n    n_people=COUNT(ppl),\n).TOP_K(10, by=n_people.DESC())\n```\n\nIn this correct version:\n1. `state` is made available via down-streaming through `Addresses.CALCULATE(state)`\n2. `first_name[:1]` is bound to the name `first_letter` through `.CALCULATE(first_letter=first_name[:1])`\n3. These properly prepared terms are then used for partitioning\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe documentation clearly identifies that the core issue is the unavailability of `state` and `first_name[:1]` for partitioning because they weren't properly prepared through `CALCULATE` operations. The `state` property needs to be made available via down-streaming, and the slice expression `first_name[:1]` needs to be bound to a name.\n\nThis aligns with PyDough's requirement that partition keys must be scalar expressions from the data collection itself, properly prepared and named."}]}]}

Based on the search results, this restriction is related to how PyDough handles data relationships and context.\n\nThe key issue is that when working with different child collections in a single operation, PyDough cannot automatically determine the relationship between these collections without explicit guidance. This creates ambiguity in how the data should be processed.\n\n## Down-Streaming and CALCULATE as the Recommended Alternative\n\nThe recommended approach to handle this restriction is to use the `CALCULATE` operation, which implements a concept called \"down-streaming\" [79d3c82].\n\n### Down-Streaming Explained\n\nFrom the documentation [79d3c82]:\n\n> Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`. As a result, it is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used.\n\nThis means that when you define expressions in a `CALCULATE` operation, those expressions become available to all descendant collections, allowing you to pass data from one context to another.\n\n### Key Rules of Down-Streaming\n\n1. Only names placed in a `CALCULATE` are available to descendant terms\n2. Other properties of the current context are not made available to descendants\n3. Name conflicts should be avoided between `CALCULATE` terms and existing collection properties\n\n## Good Examples of Using CALCULATE for Cross-Collection Operations\n\n### Example 1: Accessing address information from occupants\n\n```python\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    current_city=city, current_state=state\n).current_occupants.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    current_city,\n    current_state=current_state,\n)\n```\n\nThis example [79d3c82] shows how to make address information (city and state) available to the occupants collection by first defining them in a `CALCULATE` operation on the Addresses collection.\n\n### Example 2: Checking if packages are shipped to current addresses\n\n```python\npackage_info = Addresses.CALCULATE(\n    first_address_id=address_id\n).current_occupants.packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_shipped_to_current_addr=shipping_address.address_id == first_address_id\n)\n\nGRAPH.CALCULATE(n_cases=SUM(package_info.is_shipped_to_current_addr))\n```\n\nThis example [79d3c82] demonstrates how to compare information across collections by first capturing the address ID and then using it in a descendant collection.\n\n### Example 3: Comparing package costs to customer averages\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis example [79d3c82] shows how to compare individual package costs against the average cost of all packages for a customer.\n\n## Bad Examples and Common Mistakes\n\nThe documentation provides several examples of incorrect approaches [79d3c82]:\n\n1. Trying to access terms that don't exist in ancestors:\n```python\nGRAPH.CALCULATE(x=foo)  # Bad: foo doesn't exist\n```\n\n2. Trying to access properties not included in a parent's CALCULATE:\n```python\nPeople.packages.CALCULATE(email)  # Bad: email wasn't in a CALCULATE\n```\n\n3. Name conflicts between CALCULATE terms and collection properties:\n```python\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    zip_code=15213\n).current_address.CALCULATE(\n    is_chosen_zip_code = zip_code == 55555  # Ambiguous: which zip_code?\n)\n```\n\n## PyDough Functions and Patterns\n\nThe examples demonstrate several PyDough functions and patterns:\n- `CALCULATE`: The primary operation for defining expressions and enabling down-streaming\n- Aggregation functions like `AVG`, `SUM`, and `COUNT` for working with collections\n- Comparison operators for creating boolean conditions\n- Property access using dot notation\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in PyDough using `CALCULATE` follows this pattern:\n1. Define expressions in a parent collection using `CALCULATE`\n2. These expressions become available to descendant collections\n3. Access these expressions in descendant collections to perform operations that span multiple collections\n\nThis approach allows for clear data lineage and avoids ambiguity when working with multiple collections.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nFrom the documentation, these best practices emerge:\n1. Use `CALCULATE` to explicitly define which properties should be available to descendants\n2. Avoid name conflicts between `CALCULATE` terms and existing collection properties\n3. Structure operations as a chain of `CALCULATE` calls to maintain clear data flow\n4. Use descriptive names for calculated terms to improve readability\n\nBy following these practices and using `CALCULATE` for down-streaming, you can effectively work with multiple collections in PyDough while maintaining clear data relationships and avoiding ambiguity."}]}]}

Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\"\n\nIn essence, `PARTITION` groups data by specified keys and allows operations on these groups.\n\n## Syntax and Parameters\n\nThe syntax for `PARTITION` is [2ba30a5]:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data`: The PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name`: A string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by`: Either a single partitioning key or an iterable of 1+ partitioning keys\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using `PARTITION`:\n\n1. The original collection is grouped by the specified key(s)\n2. A new collection is created where each record represents a unique combination of the partitioning key values\n3. The original data is accessible through a sub-collection with the name specified in the `name` parameter\n4. The partitioned data loses its original ancestry and inherits ancestry from the `PARTITION` clause [2ba30a5]\n\n## Important Limitations\n\nThe documentation notes an important limitation [2ba30a5]:\n\n> \"PyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys, not an ancestor term, or a term from a child collection, or the result of a function call.\"\n\n## Examples from Documentation\n\n### Example 1: Finding unique states [2ba30a5]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(state)\n```\n\n### Example 2: Counting addresses by state [2ba30a5]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\n### Example 3: Counting people by city/state [2ba30a5]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    city,\n    n_people=COUNT(addrs.current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\n### Example 4: Finding years with most people born with yahoo emails [2ba30a5]\n```python\nyahoo_people = People.CALCULATE(\n    birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)\n).WHERE(ENDSWITH(email, \"@yahoo.com\"))\n\nPARTITION(yahoo_people, name=\"yah_ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    n_people=COUNT(yah_ppl)\n).TOP_K(5, by=n_people.DESC())\n```\n\n### Example 5: Finding packages below average cost by year/month [7b73db5]\n```python\npackage_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_year=YEAR(order_date), order_month=MONTH(order_date))\n\nPARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n).packs.WHERE(\n    package_cost < avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\n1. **Naming convention**: Using descriptive names for the partitioned data (like \"addrs\" or \"packs\")\n2. **Downstream access**: The examples show how to access the partitioned data using the name provided\n3. **Combining with other operations**: The examples demonstrate combining `PARTITION` with `CALCULATE`, `WHERE`, and `TOP_K`\n4. **Multiple partition keys**: Several examples show partitioning by multiple keys using a tuple syntax `by=(key1, key2)`\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe `PARTITION` method follows PyDough's philosophy of expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking [988171e]. It allows users to think about data in terms of groups and subgroups, which is closer to human linguistics than a relational model.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nUnder the hood, PyDough implements `PARTITION` using a `PartitionKey` class [6418705] that wraps expressions to denote them as keys used for partitioning. This class ensures that partition keys maintain proper relationships with their parent collections.\n\nIn summary, the `PARTITION` method is a powerful PyDough operation that enables grouping data by specified keys, allowing for aggregations and calculations on these groups in a way that's more intuitive than equivalent SQL GROUP BY operations."}]}]}

This is done by appending a PyDough collection with `.WHERE(cond)` where `cond` is any expression that could have been placed in a `CALCULATE` term and should have a True/False value. Every record where `cond` evaluates to True will be preserved, and the rest will be dropped from the answer. The terms in the collection are unchanged by the `WHERE` clause, since the only change is which records are kept/dropped.\n\n### Examples of WHERE\n\n**Example 1** [988171e]:\n```py\nPeople.WHERE(PRESENT(middle_name) & ENDSWITH(email, \"gmail.com\")).CALCULATE(first_name, last_name)\n```\nThis filters the People collection to only include records where the person has a middle name AND their email ends with \"gmail.com\".\n\n**Example 2** [988171e]:\n```py\nPackages.WHERE(package_cost > 100).CALCULATE(package_id, shipping_state=shipping_address.state)\n```\nThis filters the Packages collection to only include records where the package cost is greater than 100.\n\n**Example 3** [988171e]:\n```py\nPeople.CALCULATE(first_name, last_name, email).WHERE(COUNT(packages) > 5)\n```\nThis filters the People collection to only include records where the person has ordered more than 5 packages.\n\n## KEEP_IF Function\n\nFrom the search results [7a617df], `KEEP_IF` is a conditional function that selects between values based on a condition:\n\n> ### KEEP_IF\n> \n> The `KEEP_IF` function returns its first argument if the second argument is True, otherwise it returns null.\n\nThis means `KEEP_IF` operates at the expression level rather than the collection level. It doesn't filter records but conditionally selects values within a record.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\n- With `WHERE`: The entire collection is filtered, removing records that don't meet the condition. The resulting collection has fewer records but the same structure.\n- With `KEEP_IF`: All records remain in the collection, but specific values within those records may be replaced with null based on the condition.\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThe search results demonstrate that:\n\n1. Use `WHERE` when you want to filter out entire records/rows from your result set\n2. Use `KEEP_IF` when you want to conditionally include values within records while keeping all records\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about the fundamental difference between these two operations. The key distinction is their scope of operation:\n\n- `WHERE` operates on collections (rows/records)\n- `KEEP_IF` operates on expressions (values within records)\n\nThis means they serve different purposes in data transformation pipelines, with `WHERE` being used for record filtering and `KEEP_IF` being used for conditional value selection within records."}]}]}
