According to the documentation [4766684]:\n\n> The `AVG` function takes the average of the plural set of numerical values it is called on.\n\n## How Aggregation Functions Work in PyDough\n\nAggregation functions like `AVG` serve a special purpose in PyDough's data model. As explained in [4766684]:\n\n> Aggregation functions are a special set of functions that, when called on their inputs, convert them from plural to singular. \n\nThis is particularly important because:\n\n> When terms of a plural sub-collection are accessed, those terms are plural with regards to the current collection... The exception to this is when [they are] made singular with regards to [the parent collection] by aggregating it.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nHere's a basic example of using `AVG` from the documentation [4766684]:\n\n```py\nNations.CALCULATE(total_consumer_wealth = SUM(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\nA more detailed example showing how `AVG` is used in context [4766684]:\n\n```py\nTPCH.CALCULATE(avg_non_debt_balance = AVG(Customers.CALCULATE(no_debt_bal = KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0)).no_debt_bal))\n```\n\nAnother example showing how `AVG` is used with the `packages` collection [79d3c82]:\n\n```py\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.package_cost),\n)\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using `AVG(collection)`, PyDough:\n\n1. Takes a plural set of numerical values from the specified collection\n2. Calculates the arithmetic mean of those values\n3. Returns a singular value that can be used in the context of the parent collection\n\nThis transformation from plural to singular is a key concept in PyDough's hierarchical data model.\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThe documentation shows several patterns for using `AVG` effectively:\n\n1. **Use within CALCULATE**: `AVG` is typically used within a `CALCULATE` operation to define new properties [79d3c82]\n\n2. **Downstream reference**: Values calculated with `AVG` can be referenced in downstream operations [79d3c82]:\n   ```py\n   is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n   ```\n\n3. **Filtering before averaging**: You can filter values before averaging them [4766684]:\n   ```py\n   AVG(Customers.CALCULATE(no_debt_bal = KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0)).no_debt_bal)\n   ```\n\n## Comparison to Other Aggregation Functions\n\n`AVG` is one of several aggregation functions in PyDough, which also include:\n- `SUM`: Returns the sum of values [4766684]\n- `COUNT`: Counts the number of items [e67e9de]\n- `NDISTINCT`: Counts the number of distinct values [e67e9de]\n- `MAX`: Returns the maximum value [e67e9de]\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `AVG(collection)` function in PyDough calculates the arithmetic mean of numerical values in a collection. It's an aggregation function that converts plural values to a singular value, making it possible to use collection properties in calculations at the parent collection level. This is a fundamental operation in PyDough's hierarchical data model that allows for intuitive data analysis across related collections."}]}]}

From the query, we can see:\n\n- `by=priority_pct.DESC()` - This specifies the sorting order for the ranking, using the `priority_pct` field in descending order [2ba30a5]\n- `per=year_group` - This indicates that the ranking should be calculated separately for each unique value of `year_group`\n- `== 1` - This filters to only include records that have a rank of 1\n\n### DESC() Method\nThe `.DESC()` method is used to specify descending order for sorting or ranking operations. This is shown in multiple examples in the search results [2ba30a5]:\n\n```python\nPeople.TOP_K(5, by=birth_date.DESC())\n```\n\n### WHERE Function\nThe `WHERE` function is used to filter records based on a condition. As shown in the search results [79d3c82]:\n\n```python\nPeople.WHERE(PRESENT(middle_name) & ENDSWITH(email, \"gmail.com\")).CALCULATE(first_name, last_name)\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nBased on the function name and parameters, the data flow appears to be:\n\n1. Data is grouped by `year_group`\n2. Within each group, records are ranked based on `priority_pct` in descending order\n3. Only records with rank 1 (the highest `priority_pct` in each `year_group`) are kept\n\nThis is similar to the pattern shown in other PyDough examples where data is partitioned and then aggregated or filtered [2ba30a5].\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe query demonstrates several PyDough best practices:\n\n1. **Chaining operations**: The query chains the `WHERE` operation with the `RANKING` function [79d3c82]\n2. **Using descriptive field names**: Fields like `priority_pct` and `year_group` have clear, descriptive names [988171e]\n3. **Filtering to get specific insights**: The query filters to only the top-ranked item in each group [79d3c82]\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe query follows PyDough conventions by:\n\n1. Using built-in functions like `WHERE` and `RANKING` [79d3c82]\n2. Using the `.DESC()` method for specifying sort order [2ba30a5]\n3. Using a comparison operator (`== 1`) to filter results [79d3c82]\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asks about the purpose of the `WHERE(RANKING(by=priority_pct.DESC(), per=year_group\") == 1)` step. Based on the analysis above, this step is filtering the data to only include the record with the highest `priority_pct` value within each `year_group`. In other words, it's selecting the top priority item for each year group.\n\n## Similar Examples from Search Results\n\nWhile the exact 'Yearly Priority Analysis' example isn't in the search results, there are similar examples that demonstrate ranking and filtering patterns:\n\nFrom [8ad9c9f], an example of finding the highest residency density states:\n```python\n%%pydough\n# For each address, identify how many current occupants it has\naddr_info = Addresses.CALCULATE(n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants))\n# Partition the addresses by the state, and for each state calculate the\n# average value of `n_occupants` for all addresses in that state\nstates = PARTITION(\n  addr_info,\n  name=\"addrs\",\n  by=state\n).CALCULATE(\n  state,\n  average_occupants=AVG(addrs.n_occupants)\n)\n# Obtain the top-5 states with the highest average\nresult = states.TOP_K(5, by=average_occupants.DESC())\n```\n\nThis example shows a similar pattern of partitioning data, calculating metrics, and then selecting top records based on those metrics."}]}]}

Uses the `WHERE` clause to filter the Customers collection\n2. Compares each customer's `acctbal` (account balance) with `RELAVG(acctbal)`\n3. `RELAVG(acctbal)` calculates the global average of all customers' account balances\n4. Only returns customers whose balance exceeds this global average\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in this example is straightforward:\n1. The `RELAVG(acctbal)` function calculates a single value - the global average of all account balances\n2. Each customer's individual `acctbal` is compared against this global average\n3. The `WHERE` clause filters the collection to only include records where the condition is true\n\n## PyDough Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThis example demonstrates several PyDough best practices:\n\n1. **Concise syntax**: The solution is expressed in a single, readable line of code\n2. **Using appropriate window functions**: `RELAVG` is the correct choice for calculating a global average\n3. **Direct comparison**: The solution directly compares individual values against an aggregate value\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThe documentation also shows how to calculate averages at different levels. For example [80fba2b]:\n\n```python\n# Finds all customers whose account balance is above the average of all\n# customers' account balances within that nation.\nNations.customers.WHERE(acctbal > RELAVG(acctbal, levels=1))\n```\n\nThis variation calculates the average per nation (using `levels=1`), rather than the global average.\n\n## Related Functions\n\nFor context, PyDough also offers other related functions:\n- `RELSUM` [80fba2b]: Calculates the sum across multiple rows\n- `AVG` [4766684]: A standard aggregation function that converts plural values to singular by taking their average\n\nThe solution uses `RELAVG` rather than `AVG` because we need to compare each individual value against a global aggregate, which is exactly what window functions like `RELAVG` are designed for."}]}]}

If not, what is the workaround?\"\n\n## Answer Based on Documentation\n\nBased on the provided documentation, I'll explain how PyDough handles comparisons between attributes of different sub-collections within the same parent record.\n\n### Direct Comparison Between Sub-Collections\n\nThe documentation doesn't explicitly state whether direct comparison between attributes of different sub-collections is possible in a single expression. However, we can infer from the PyDough patterns and examples that:\n\n1. PyDough follows a hierarchical model for data access [988171e]\n2. The language allows for accessing sub-collections and their properties\n3. There are specific patterns for working with collections and their relationships\n\n### PyDough Data Model and Access Patterns\n\nPyDough represents data in a hierarchical model where:\n\n- Collections contain records with scalar properties and sub-collection properties [2e54fa8]\n- Sub-collections can be accessed from parent collections\n- Each collection has specific cardinality relationships with its sub-collections (One-to-Many, etc.) [2e54fa8]\n\nAs shown in this example from [2e54fa8]:\n```\nPyDough property: nations.customers\n\nThis property connects collection nations to customers.\n\nCardinality of connection: One -> Many\n\nIs reversible: yes\n\nReverse property: customers.nation\n\nThe subcollection relationship is defined by the following join conditions:\n\nnations.key == customers.nation_key\n```\n\n### Working with Sub-Collections\n\nWhen working with sub-collections, PyDough provides several approaches:\n\n1. **CALCULATE**: Used to derive expressions in terms of the current context, child contexts, and ancestor contexts [79d3c82]\n2. **WHERE**: Used to filter records based on conditions [79d3c82]\n3. **Down-Streaming**: A mechanism where expressions defined in a `CALCULATE` call are available to descendants [79d3c82]\n\n### Best Practices for Sub-Collection Comparisons\n\nBased on the examples in the documentation, the recommended approach for comparing attributes of different sub-collections appears to be:\n\n1. Use `CALCULATE` to define expressions for each sub-collection attribute you want to compare\n2. Then use these calculated expressions in a comparison within another `CALCULATE` or `WHERE` clause\n\nFor example, from [79d3c82], we can see this pattern:\n```python\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    original_address=current_address.address_id,\n    n_packages=COUNT(current_address.packages_billed_to),\n).CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    pct=100.0 * COUNT(packages_billed_home) / n_packages\n)\n```\n\nThis example shows how to work with multiple sub-collections by first calculating values from one sub-collection and then using those values in subsequent calculations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the documentation doesn't explicitly state whether direct comparison between attributes of different sub-collections is possible in a single expression, the PyDough pattern appears to be:\n\n1. First use `CALCULATE` to define expressions for each sub-collection attribute\n2. Then use these calculated expressions in subsequent operations\n\nThis approach follows PyDough's hierarchical data model and allows for clean, readable code that maintains the relationships between collections and sub-collections."}]}]}
{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "You are an analytics expert and a proficient Pydough generator that creates Python code based on natural language descriptions."}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What are the primary purposes of using the `CALCULATE` expression?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "# Primary Purposes of Using the `CALCULATE` Expression in PyDough\n\nBased on the provided documentation, the `CALCULATE` expression is a fundamental operation in PyDough that serves several key purposes.\n\n## Definition and Core Purpose\n\nThe `CALCULATE` expression allows users to:\n\n1. Select a subset of properties from records in a collection\n2. Derive new properties through calculated expressions\n3. Create intermediate expressions for later use in a query\n\nAs stated in the documentation [fcc80aa]:\n> \"Most of the time, an analytical question will only want a subset of the properties, and may want to derive new properties via calculated expressions. The way to do this is with a `CALCULATE` term. This method contains the expressions that should be derived by the `CALCULATE` operation.\"\n\n## How CALCULATE Works\n\nThe `CALCULATE` method accepts expressions as either:\n- Positional arguments (using the expression's existing name)\n- Keyword arguments (using the keyword as the output expression name)\n\nFrom [fcc80aa]:\n> \"These expressions can be positional arguments or keyword arguments. Keyword arguments use the name of the keyword as the name of the output expression. Positional arguments use the name of the expression, if one exists, otherwise an arbitrary name is chosen.\"\n\n## Valid Expressions in CALCULATE\n\nAccording to [fcc80aa], the value of terms in a `CALCULATE` must be expressions that are singular with regards to the current context, including:\n\n1. \"Referencing one of the scalar properties of the current collection\"\n2. \"Creating a literal\"\n3. \"Referencing a singular expression of a sub-collection of the current collection that is singular with regards to the current collection\"\n4. \"Calling a non-aggregation function on more singular expressions\"\n5. \"Calling an aggregation function on a plural expression\"\n\n## Key Examples\n\n### Basic Property Selection\n\n```py\n# For every person, fetch just their first name and last name\nPeople.CALCULATE(first_name, last_name)\n```\n[fcc80aa]\n\n### Deriving New Properties\n\n```py\n# For every person, find their full name (without the middle name) and count how many packages they purchased\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    name=JOIN_STRINGS(\"\", first_name, last_name),\n    n_packages_ordered=COUNT(packages),\n)\n```\n[fcc80aa]\n\n### Creating Intermediate Expressions\n\n```py\n# For every person, find their full name including the middle name if one exists, as well as their email\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    has_middle_name=PRESENT(middle_name)\n    full_name_with_middle=JOIN_STRINGS(\" \", first_name, middle_name, last_name),\n    full_name_without_middle=JOIN_STRINGS(\" \", first_name, last_name),\n).CALCULATE(\n    full_name=IFF(has_middle_name, full_name_with_middle, full_name_without_middle),\n    email=email,\n)\n```\n[fcc80aa]\n\n### Global Aggregation\n\n```py\n# Count how many people, packages, and addresses are known in the system\nGRAPH.CALCULATE(\n    n_people=COUNT(People),\n    n_packages=COUNT(Packages),\n    n_addresses=COUNT(Addresses),\n)\n```\n[fcc80aa]\n\n## Down-Streaming with CALCULATE\n\nAn important feature of `CALCULATE` is \"down-streaming,\" where expressions defined in a `CALCULATE` call become available to all descendants of the current context [e67e9de]:\n\n> \"Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name.\"\n\nThis allows for reusing calculated values in nested operations, as shown in this example [e67e9de]:\n\n```py\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    current_city=city, current_state=state\n).current_occupants.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    current_city,\n    current_state=current_state,\n)\n```\n\n## Comparison with SQL\n\nThe `CALCULATE` expression helps PyDough achieve its goal of simplifying complex analytical queries. As demonstrated in [988171e]:\n\n```py\n# PyDough\nresult = People.CALCULATE(\n    name,\n    net_income = SUM(jobs.income_earned) - SUM(schools.tuition_paid)\n)\n```\n\nThis is much simpler than the equivalent SQL query which requires multiple joins and subqueries [988171e].\n\n## Best Practices and Limitations\n\n1. Avoid name conflicts between `CALCULATE` terms and existing properties [e67e9de]\n2. Each term in a `CALCULATE` must be scalar with respect to the current context [09e9927]\n3. A term defined in a `CALCULATE` doesn't take effect until after the `CALCULATE` completes [fcc80aa]\n4. Earlier `CALCULATE` clauses can be used to derive intermediary expressions [fcc80aa]\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `CALCULATE` expression in PyDough serves as a powerful tool for selecting, transforming, and creating data in a hierarchical document model. It simplifies complex analytical queries by providing an intuitive way to express calculations and transformations while maintaining the relationships between different collections of data."}]}]}

It's particularly useful for calculating ratios and proportions.\n\n## How to Use RELSUM for Customer Balance Ratio\n\nTo calculate the ratio of an individual customer's balance to the total balance across all customers, you would use `RELSUM` as follows:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELSUM(acctbal))\n```\n\nThis expression divides each customer's account balance by the sum of all customer account balances, giving you the proportion that each customer's balance represents of the total [0a7d61d].\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in this operation works as follows:\n\n1. `RELSUM(acctbal)` calculates the sum of all account balances across all customers\n2. Each individual customer's `acctbal` is divided by this total sum\n3. The result is stored as a new calculated field called `ratio`\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThis example demonstrates several PyDough best practices:\n\n1. **Hierarchical thinking**: PyDough allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking [988171e], which makes this type of ratio calculation intuitive.\n\n2. **Avoiding complex SQL**: The PyDough approach avoids the need for complex SQL subqueries that would otherwise be required [8e03891].\n\n3. **Contextual calculations**: The calculation maintains the context of each customer while accessing the global sum [0a7d61d].\n\n## PyDough Conventions\n\nThis solution follows PyDough conventions by:\n\n1. Using the `CALCULATE` method to create a new derived field [988171e]\n2. Using a window function (`RELSUM`) to perform an aggregation across rows [0a7d61d]\n3. Following the pattern of dividing an individual value by an aggregated value to create a ratio\n\n## Alternative Approaches\n\nPyDough offers several related functions that could be used in similar scenarios:\n\n1. **RELCOUNT**: Returns the number of non-null records in multiple rows [0a7d61d]\n   ```python\n   Customers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELCOUNT(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0.0)))\n   ```\n\n2. **RELSIZE**: Returns the number of total records [0a7d61d]\n   ```python\n   Customers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELSIZE())\n   ```\n\n## Example with Context Levels\n\nFor more complex scenarios where you want to calculate ratios within specific contexts (like customers within nations), you can use the optional `levels` parameter:\n\n```python\nNations.customers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELSUM(acctbal, levels=1))\n```\n\nThis would calculate the ratio of each customer's balance to the total balance of all customers in the same nation [0a7d61d].\n\n## Comparison to SQL\n\nThis simple PyDough expression would require a more complex SQL query with subqueries or window functions [988171e]. PyDough's approach is more intuitive and closer to how humans think about the problem.\n\nIn summary, `RELSUM` provides a straightforward way to calculate the ratio of an individual customer's balance to the total balance across all customers, demonstrating PyDough's ability to express complex analytical questions in a simple, hierarchical manner."}]}]}

If False, tied values have different rank values where ties are broken arbitrarily.\n\n`dense` (optional): optional argument (default False) specifying that if `allow_ties` is True and a tie is found, should the next value after the ties be the current ranking value plus 1, as opposed to jumping to a higher value based on the number of ties that were there. For example, with the values `[a, a, b, b, b, c]`, the values with `dense=True` would be `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, but with `dense=False` they would be `[1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`.\n```\n\n## Examples of RANKING Usage\n\nThe documentation [a172ab8] provides these examples of how to use the RANKING function:\n\n```python\n# Rank customers per-nation by their account balance\n# (highest = rank #1, no ties)\nNations.customers.CALCULATE(r = RANKING(by=acctbal.DESC(), levels=1))\n\n# For every customer, finds their most recent order\n# (ties allowed)\nCustomers.orders.WHERE(RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1, allow_ties=True) == 1)\n```\n\n## PyDough Operators Context\n\nLooking at the broader context of PyDough, the search results show that PyDough has a module for operators [8b38c51] and a class called `PyDoughOperator` [8b38c51] which serves as \"the abstract base class for all PyDough operators used to describe operations such as arithmetic or function calls, whether they return an expression or a collection.\"\n\nThe documentation also mentions \"builtin registered operators\" [8b38c51] which are available for use in PyDough code without needing to directly import them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided documentation, `RANKING` is a function in PyDough. It is specifically a window function that operates on collections to determine the ordinal position of records when sorted by specified criteria."}]}]}

According to [7330190]:\n\n> The `PARTITION` operation is used to create a new collection by partitioning the records of another collection based on 1+ partitioning terms. Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\n\nThe syntax for this operation is:\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of 1+ partitioning keys\n\n## Restrictions on the `by` Parameter\n\nThe documentation explicitly states in [7330190]:\n\n> PyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys, not an ancestor term, or a term from a child collection, or the result of a function call.\n\nThis restriction is further reinforced by the implementation details found in [6418705], where the `PartitionKey` class is defined:\n\n```python\nclass PartitionKey(PyDoughExpressionQDAG)\n\"\"\"\nThe wrapper class around expressions to denote that an expression\nis a key used for partitioning. Currently only allows the expression to be\na reference to an expression from the partition data.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## Why This Restriction Exists\n\nThe restriction exists for several important reasons:\n\n1. **Implementation Simplicity**: As shown in [da99528], the `PARTITION` operation needs to be translated into SQL, which typically uses GROUP BY clauses. By restricting the `by` parameter to simple references, the translation process is more straightforward.\n\n2. **Clarity and Predictability**: The restriction ensures that the partitioning logic is clear and predictable, making it easier to understand what the code is doing.\n\n3. **Optimization**: Simple references can be more efficiently processed by the underlying database engine compared to complex expressions.\n\n## Examples Demonstrating the Restriction\n\n### Good Examples\n\nFrom [7330190], here are examples of valid `PARTITION` usage:\n\n**Good Example #1**: Find every unique state.\n```python\n%%pydough\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(state)\n```\n\n**Good Example #2**: For every state, count how many addresses are in that state.\n```python\n%%pydough\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\n**Good Example #4**: For every year/month, find all packages that were below the average cost of all packages ordered in that year/month.\n```python\n%%pydough\npackage_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_year=YEAR(order_date), order_month=MONTH(order_date))\nPARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n).packs.WHERE(\n    package_cost < avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\n### Bad Examples\n\nFrom [7330190], here are examples of invalid `PARTITION` usage:\n\n**Bad Example #4**: Count how many packages were ordered in each year. Invalid because `YEAR(order_date)` is not allowed to be used as a partition term.\n```python\n%%pydough\nPARTITION(Packages, name=\"packs\", by=YEAR(order_date)).CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages)\n)\n```\n\n**Bad Example #5**: Count how many people live in each state. Invalid because `current_address.state` is not allowed to be used as a partition term.\n```python\n%%pydough\nPARTITION(People, name=\"ppl\", by=current_address.state).CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages)\n)\n```\n\n## Best Practice: Pre-calculate Complex Expressions\n\nThe documentation in [0e98bac] and [7b73db5] shows that the recommended pattern is to pre-calculate any complex expressions using `CALCULATE` before using them in `PARTITION`:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\nupdated_nations = nations.CALCULATE(key, name_length=LENGTH(name))\ngrouped_nations = PARTITION(\n    updated_nations, name=\"n\", by=(name_length)\n).CALCULATE(\n    name_length,\n    nation_count=COUNT(n.key)\n)\n```\n\nThis pattern ensures that the expressions are properly calculated and available as scalar fields before being used in the `PARTITION` operation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe restriction on the `by` parameter in `PARTITION` is an intentional design choice in PyDough that promotes clarity, predictability, and efficient execution. By requiring pre-calculation of complex expressions, PyDough ensures that partitioning operations are well-defined and can be efficiently translated to SQL queries."}]}]}

While there isn't a direct answer to this specific question in the documentation, we can infer best practices from the examples and explanations provided.\n\n## PyDough's Approach to Problem-Solving\n\nPyDough is designed to simplify analytics by using a logical document model that abstracts away complex SQL operations like joins. According to the documentation [988171e]:\n\n> PyDough allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking, as seen in models such as MongoDB, since that mental model is closer to human linguistics than a relational model.\n\n> PyDough code can be written in and interleaved with Python code, and practices a lazy evaluation scheme that does not qualify or execute any logic until requested.\n\n## When to Avoid Intermediate Steps\n\nFrom the \"What-If\" analysis example [8e03891], we can see that PyDough supports both direct, compact solutions and more incremental approaches with intermediate steps:\n\n```python\n# Direct approach (compact)\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nThe documentation suggests that intermediate steps should be avoided when:\n\n1. **The query is simple enough to express in a single statement** - For straightforward analytics questions, using a direct approach without intermediate steps can make the code more concise and easier to understand.\n\n2. **Performance is a critical concern** - As noted in the demos README [0e98bac], PyDough \"can be written incrementally via expressions that are meaningless until the final context.\" This suggests that excessive intermediate steps might introduce unnecessary overhead.\n\n## Benefits of PyDough's Approach\n\nThe documentation highlights several benefits of PyDough over traditional SQL or ORM approaches [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> Often, PyDough code will be significantly more compact than equivalent SQL text, and therefore easier for a human to verify for logical correctness.\n\n> The complex semantics of aggregation keys, different types of joins, and aggregating before vs after joining are all abstracted away by PyDough. These details require much deeper understanding of SQL semantics than most have time to learn how to do correctly, meaning that PyDough can have a lower learning curve to write correct code for complex questions.\n\n## When Intermediate Steps Are Beneficial\n\nConversely, the \"What-If\" analysis notebook [8e03891] demonstrates that breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps can be beneficial for:\n\n1. **Exploratory analysis** - When you're exploring data and iteratively refining your approach\n2. **Complex queries** - When the query logic is complex and breaking it down improves readability\n3. **Reusable components** - When certain calculations will be reused in multiple places\n\nAs stated in the notebook [8e03891]:\n\n> We are opting to demonstrate this because:\n> 1. We believe this is a good representation for how PyDough can be leveraged to gradually handle increasing question complexity.\n> 2. We believe this reflects an investigative approach to query generation, where someone may understand at a high-level what needs to be done, but not necessary that \"path\" to get there.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the documentation, intermediate steps or partitioning in PyDough should be avoided when:\n- The query is simple and can be expressed concisely\n- Performance is a priority\n- The code's readability isn't compromised by combining steps\n\nHowever, intermediate steps are valuable for complex, exploratory analyses where clarity and the ability to iterate quickly are more important than conciseness or minor performance considerations.\n\nPyDough's design philosophy emphasizes simplicity and readability while abstracting away complex SQL operations, making it suitable for both direct and incremental approaches to problem-solving."}]}]}
{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "You are an analytics expert and a proficient Pydough generator that creates Python code based on natural language descriptions."}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "How does the rule about accessing previously calculated attributes influence the ordering of operations in a complex query?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "# Understanding How Previously Calculated Attributes Influence Operation Ordering in PyDough\n\nThe original question asks about how the rule regarding accessing previously calculated attributes influences the ordering of operations in a complex PyDough query. Based on the provided search results, I'll explain this concept in detail.\n\n## PyDough's Down-Streaming Mechanism\n\nPyDough has a feature called \"down-streaming\" that allows expressions defined in a `CALCULATE` call to be available to all descendants of the current context using the same name [e67e9de]. This is a fundamental concept that directly impacts how operations must be ordered in complex queries.\n\n### The Down-Streaming Rule\n\nAs explained in the documentation [e67e9de]:\n\n> Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`.\n\nThis rule has several important implications for query construction:\n\n1. Only names that have been placed in a `CALCULATE` are available to descendant terms\n2. Any other properties of the current context are not made available to its descendants\n3. Name conflicts should be avoided between calculated attributes and existing properties\n\n## How This Influences Operation Ordering\n\nThe down-streaming mechanism directly influences how operations must be ordered in complex queries because:\n\n1. **Calculated attributes must be defined before they can be used**: Any attribute you want to reference in a later operation must be calculated in an earlier operation [79d3c82].\n\n2. **Hierarchical dependency**: Operations that depend on calculated attributes must come after the operations that define those attributes [e67e9de].\n\n3. **Ancestor-descendant relationship**: Only descendants can access attributes calculated by ancestors, not vice versa [79d3c82].\n\n## Examples Demonstrating This Influence\n\n### Good Example: Proper Ordering of Operations\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example from [79d3c82], the operation ordering is critical:\n1. First, calculate the average package cost at the customer level\n2. Then, for each package, determine if its cost is above the average\n\nThis works because the `avg_package_cost` attribute is calculated in an ancestor context before being used in the descendant context.\n\n### Bad Example: Incorrect Ordering of Operations\n\n```python\ncust_info = Customers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n)\n\nCustomers.packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis example from [79d3c82] fails because:\n> Even though `cust_info` has defined `avg_package_cost`, the final expression `Customers.packages.CALCULATE(...)` does not have `cust_info` as an ancestor, so it cannot access `avg_package_cost` since it is not part of its own ancestry.\n\nThe operation ordering is incorrect because the second operation tries to use a calculated attribute that isn't in its ancestry chain.\n\n## Complex Query Example\n\nA more complex example demonstrating proper operation ordering [79d3c82]:\n\n```python\npackages_billed_home = packages.WHERE(\n    billing_address.address_id == original_address\n)\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    original_address=current_address.address_id,\n    n_packages=COUNT(current_address.packages_billed_to),\n).CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    pct=100.0 * COUNT(packages_billed_home) / n_packages\n)\n```\n\nThis example shows:\n1. First defining a filtered collection based on a condition\n2. Then calculating attributes in the first `CALCULATE` operation\n3. Finally using those calculated attributes in a subsequent `CALCULATE` operation\n\n## Best Practices for Operation Ordering\n\nBased on the documentation, here are best practices for ordering operations in complex PyDough queries:\n\n1. **Define calculated attributes early**: Calculate attributes in ancestor contexts before using them in descendant contexts [e67e9de].\n\n2. **Avoid name conflicts**: \"It is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used\" [e67e9de].\n\n3. **Use chaining for dependent operations**: Chain operations in the correct order to ensure attributes are calculated before they're used [79d3c82].\n\n4. **Be aware of ancestry relationships**: Remember that only descendants can access attributes calculated by ancestors [79d3c82].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rule about accessing previously calculated attributes fundamentally influences the ordering of operations in complex PyDough queries. Operations must be ordered such that attributes are calculated before they're used, and the ancestry relationship between operations must be maintained to ensure proper access to calculated attributes. This requires careful planning of the query structure to ensure that operations are performed in the correct order."}]}]}

This is because the partition keys become available as terms in the resulting collection created by the `PARTITION` operation.\n\n### Key Concepts from the Documentation\n\n1. **PARTITION Operation Basics** [988171e]\n   The `PARTITION` operation groups records based on partitioning terms:\n   \n   ```\n   The `PARTITION` operation is used to create a new collection by partitioning the records of another collection based on 1+ partitioning terms. Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\n   ```\n\n2. **Syntax for PARTITION** [988171e]\n   ```\n   The syntax for this is `PARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)`. The `data` argument is the PyDough collection that is to be partitioned. The `name` argument is a string indicating the name that is to be used when accessing the partitioned data, and the `by` argument is either a single partitioning key, or an iterable of 1+ partitioning keys.\n   ```\n\n3. **Accessing Partition Keys in CALCULATE** [7330190]\n   From example #2:\n   ```py\n   PARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n   state,\n   n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n   )\n   ```\n   \n   This example shows that after partitioning by `state`, the `state` key is directly referenced in the subsequent `CALCULATE`.\n\n4. **Multiple Partition Keys** [7330190]\n   From example #3:\n   ```py\n   PARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(\n   state,\n   city,\n   n_people=COUNT(addrs.current_occupants)\n   )\n   ```\n   \n   When partitioning by multiple keys (`city` and `state`), both can be directly referenced in the `CALCULATE`.\n\n5. **Down-Streaming of Partition Keys** [7b73db5]\n   ```py\n   PARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n   avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n   ).packs.WHERE(\n   package_cost < avg_package_cost\n   )\n   ```\n   \n   This example shows how partition keys become available through down-streaming, allowing them to be referenced in subsequent operations.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Direct Reference**: Partition keys should be directly referenced by their original names in the `CALCULATE` following a `PARTITION`.\n\n2. **Down-Streaming**: Partition keys are automatically made available to descendant operations through down-streaming [7b73db5].\n\n3. **Constraints on Partition Keys**: Only references to scalar expressions from the data collection itself can be used as partition keys, not ancestor terms, child collection terms, or function call results [988171e].\n\n### Example Pattern\n\nA typical pattern for referencing partition keys in a `CALCULATE` following a `PARTITION` is:\n\n```py\nPARTITION(collection, name=\"subcoll_name\", by=key_name).CALCULATE(\n    key_name,  # Direct reference to the partition key\n    aggregated_value=AGGREGATION_FUNCTION(subcoll_name.some_property)\n)\n```\n\nThis pattern is demonstrated consistently across the examples in the documentation."}]}]}

According to the documentation [4766684]:\n\n> Aggregation functions are a special set of functions that, when called on their inputs, convert them from plural to singular.\n\nSpecifically for `COUNT`:\n\n> The `COUNT` function returns the count of the number of records in the plural set of values it is called on.\n\n## Understanding `n_combos=COUNT(groups)`\n\nWhile the specific 'Above-Average Part Size Combinations' example isn't directly shown in the search results, I can explain what `n_combos=COUNT(groups)` would calculate based on PyDough conventions:\n\n1. `groups` would be a subcollection or a partitioned set of data\n2. `COUNT(groups)` counts the number of records in that subcollection\n3. `n_combos=` assigns this count to a variable named \"n_combos\"\n\nThis follows the pattern shown in examples like [8ad9c9f]:\n\n```py\ncities.CALCULATE(\n  state,\n  city,\n  n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\nWhere `n_occupants` is calculated by counting the number of records in the `current_occupants` subcollection.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nIn PyDough, when terms of a plural sub-collection are accessed, those terms are plural with regards to the current collection [4766684]. The `COUNT` function transforms this plural subcollection into a singular value that can be used in calculations.\n\nThe typical pattern is:\n1. Access a subcollection (like `groups`)\n2. Apply an aggregation function (`COUNT`) to make it singular\n3. Assign the result to a named variable (`n_combos`)\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThis pattern demonstrates several PyDough best practices:\n- Using aggregation functions to convert plural values to singular ones\n- Naming calculated values clearly (`n_combos` indicates it's counting combinations)\n- Following the PyDough convention of using `CALCULATE` with named expressions\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe syntax follows PyDough conventions where:\n- Aggregation functions like `COUNT` are used to handle plural-to-singular transformations\n- Named expressions use the format `name=expression`\n- Hierarchical data access follows the dot notation pattern\n\nWithout seeing the specific example, I can't provide the exact context, but this pattern is consistent with how PyDough handles aggregations across subcollections."}]}]}

Certain PyDough operations, such as specific filters, can cause plural data to become singular. In this case, PyDough will still ban the plural data from being treated as singular unless the `.SINGULAR()` modifier is used to tell PyDough that the data should be treated as singular.\n\n## When to Use SINGULAR with Year-Specific Calculations\n\nWhen dealing with calculations across multiple specific years (like 1995-1998), the `SINGULAR` function becomes necessary when:\n\n1.

You need to access properties of the filtered sub-collection\n\nThe documentation [eb3ac75] provides a practical example of using `SINGULAR`:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\nnation_4 = nations.WHERE(key == 4).SINGULAR()\npydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_4_name=nation_4.name))\n```\n\nIn this example, `SINGULAR()` is used after filtering to a specific nation with key 4, which ensures there's at most one matching nation per region.\n\n## Important Best Practices\n\nThe documentation [edc4690] emphasizes a critical warning:\n\n> It is very important that this only be used if the user is certain that the data will be singular, since otherwise it can result in undefined behavior when the PyDough code is executed.\n\n## Good Examples of SINGULAR Usage\n\nFrom [edc4690], here are examples of proper `SINGULAR` usage:\n\n**Example 1**: Accessing the package cost of the most recent package ordered by each person:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\nmost_recent_package = packages.WHERE(\n    RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1) == 1\n).SINGULAR()\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    first_name,\n    middle_name,\n    last_name,\n    most_recent_package_cost=most_recent_package.package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis works because the filter ensures only one record per person.\n\n**Example 2**: Accessing the email of current occupants with a specific name:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\njs = current_occupants.WHERE(\n    (first_name == \"John\") &\n    (last_name == \"Smith\") &\n    ABSENT(middle_name)\n).SINGULAR()\n\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    address_id,\n    john_smith_email=DEFAULT_TO(js.email, \"NO JOHN SMITH LIVING HERE\")\n)\n```\n\n## Applying to Year-Specific Calculations\n\nWhen working with multiple specific years (like 1995-1998), you would typically:\n\n1. Filter your data to the specific years of interest\n2. Apply `.SINGULAR()` if you're certain each parent record has at most one matching child record after filtering\n3. Access properties of the filtered sub-collection\n\nFor example, if you wanted to access data for a specific year like 1995 from a collection that might have multiple years per parent record, you would use a pattern similar to:\n\n```python\nyear_1995_data = collection.WHERE(year == 1995).SINGULAR()\nparent_collection.CALCULATE(\n    id,\n    data_from_1995=year_1995_data.some_property\n)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `SINGULAR` function in PyDough is essential when working with filtered data across specific years or other criteria. It tells PyDough to treat a potentially plural relationship as singular after filtering, allowing you to access properties directly. However, it must only be used when you're certain the relationship is truly singular after filtering, or you risk undefined behavior."}]}]}

It takes a base date/timestamp as its first argument and can accept optional modifier arguments.\n\n## The Two Main Types of Modifier Arguments\n\nThe `DATETIME` function accepts two main types of modifier arguments as described in [9ba2280]:\n\n### 1. Truncation Modifiers\n\nTruncation modifiers follow the format `\"start of <UNIT>\"` and are used to truncate a datetime value to a specific unit of time.\n\nFrom the documentation [9ba2280]:\n> A string literal in the format `start of <UNIT>` indicating to truncate the datetime value to a certain unit, which can be the following:\n\nThe supported units for truncation are:\n- **Years**: Aliases are `\"years\"`, `\"year\"`, and `\"y\"`\n- **Months**: Aliases are `\"months\"`, `\"month\"`, and `\"mm\"`\n- **Days**: Aliases are `\"days\"`, `\"day\"`, and `\"d\"`\n- **Weeks**: Aliases are `\"weeks\"`, `\"week\"`, and `\"w\"`\n- **Hours**: Aliases are `\"hours\"`, `\"hour\"`, and `\"h\"`\n- **Minutes**: Aliases are `\"minutes\"`, `\"minute\"`, and `\"m\"`\n- **Seconds**: Aliases are `\"seconds\"`, `\"second\"`, and `\"s\"`\n\n### 2. Interval Adjustment Modifiers\n\nInterval adjustment modifiers follow the format `\u00b1<AMT> <UNIT>` and are used to add or subtract a specific amount of time from a datetime value.\n\nFrom the documentation [9ba2280]:\n> A string literal in the form `\u00b1<AMT> <UNIT>` indicating to add/subtract a date/time interval to the datetime value. The sign can be `+` or `-`, and if omitted the default is `+`. The amount must be an integer. The unit must be one of the same unit strings allowed for truncation.\n\n## Examples from the Documentation\n\nThe documentation [9ba2280] provides examples of using the `DATETIME` function with both types of modifiers:\n\n```py\n# Returns the following datetime moments:\n# 1. The current timestamp\n# 2. The start of the current month\n# 3. Exactly 12 hours from now\n# 4. The last day of the previous year\n```\n\nAdditionally, the documentation [96f9c2c] provides more detailed examples of using the `DATETIME` function with the \"start of week\" unit, which is affected by the `start_of_week` configuration:\n\n```py\n# Understanding the behavior of DATETIME with `start of week`\n# Set the start of the week to Monday\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.MONDAY\n# This would set `dt` to the start of the week for March 20, 2025 (Wednesday)\n# to be March 17, 2025 (recent Monday)\nTPCH.calculate(dt = DATETIME(\"2025-03-20\", \"start of week\")) # dt = 2025-03-17\n\n# start_of_week is set to Thursday,\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.Thursday\n# This would set `dt` to the start of the week for March 20, 2025 (Thursday)\n# to be March 20, 2025 (recent Thursday)\nTPCH.calculate(dt = DATETIME(\"2025-03-20\", \"start of week\")) # dt = 2025-03-20\n```\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. All modifier options are case-insensitive and ignore leading/trailing/extra whitespace [9ba2280].\n2. If there are multiple modifiers, they operate left-to-right [9ba2280].\n3. The behavior of the \"start of week\" unit is affected by the `start_of_week` configuration [96f9c2c].\n4. The `DATETIME` function can accept various types of base arguments, including string literals like \"now\", string representations of dates, datetime literals, or columns of datetime data [9ba2280].\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive explanation of the two main types of modifier arguments accepted by the `DATETIME` function in PyDough, with examples of their syntax and usage."}]}]}

However, I don't see Bad Example #9 specifically mentioned in the provided search results. The search results show Bad Examples #1-8 for the PARTITION operation [7330190], but not #9.\n\nFrom the information available, I can explain the general principles of how PARTITION works in Pydough and common mistakes when accessing sub-collections after partitioning.\n\n## How PARTITION Works in Pydough\n\nAccording to the documentation [7330190], the `PARTITION` operation in Pydough:\n\n> \"is used to create a new collection by partitioning the records of another collection based on 1+ partitioning terms. Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\"\n\nThe syntax is: `PARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)` where:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of 1+ partitioning keys\n\n## Important Principles About Partitioning\n\nFrom the documentation [7330190], there are several key principles about partitioning:\n\n1. \"If the partitioned data is accessed, its original ancestry is lost. Instead, it inherits the ancestry from the `PARTITION` clause.\"\n\n2. \"The partitioned data still has access to any of the down-streamed terms from its original ancestry.\"\n\n3. \"PyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys, not an ancestor term, or a term from a child collection, or the result of a function call.\"\n\n## Common Mistakes with PARTITION\n\nBased on the bad examples provided [7330190], common mistakes include:\n\n1. Not providing a valid `name` when partitioning (Bad Example #2)\n2. Not providing a `by` argument (Bad Example #3)\n3. Using a function call directly as a partition key instead of first calculating it (Bad Example #4)\n4. Using a property from a parent collection as a partition key (Bad Example #5)\n5. Trying to reference properties that aren't partition keys (Bad Example #7)\n6. Trying to use `.PARTITION` after a collection that isn't a graph-level collection (Bad Example #7, which appears twice)\n\n## Accessing Sub-Collections After Partitioning\n\nFrom the documentation and examples [7330190], when accessing the partitioned data:\n\n1. You must use the name specified in the `name` parameter\n2. The partitioned data can access terms from its original ancestry through down-streaming\n3. You cannot access properties that weren't part of the partition keys or weren't down-streamed\n\n## Partition Child Implementation Details\n\nLooking at the implementation details [7e1454c], we can see that:\n\n> \"The child of a PARTITION BY clause is always presumed to be plural since PyDough must assume that multiple records can be grouped together into the same bucket.\"\n\nThis is an important consideration when accessing the sub-collection after partitioning.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile I cannot identify Bad Example #9 specifically, the mistake related to accessing the sub-collection after partitioning would likely involve one of these issues:\n- Trying to access the original ancestry which is lost\n- Trying to access properties that weren't part of the partition keys or weren't down-streamed\n- Not using the correct name specified in the `name` parameter\n- Misunderstanding the cardinality (the child is always presumed to be plural)\n\nFor a more specific answer about Bad Example #9, additional context would be needed."}]}]}

This means that if a term in a `CALCULATE` uses the definition of a term defined in the same `CALCULATE`, it will not work.\"\n\nThis clearly states that fields defined within a `CALCULATE` expression are not available for reference within the same `CALCULATE` block where they are defined. They only become available after that `CALCULATE` operation completes.\n\n## Down-Streaming: How Fields Become Available\n\nThe documentation [e67e9de] explains the concept of \"Down-Streaming\" which governs how fields become available:\n\n> \"Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`.\"\n\nThis means that once a field is defined in a `CALCULATE` expression, it becomes available to:\n1. Subsequent operations on the same collection\n2. Operations on descendant collections (sub-collections)\n\n## Example Demonstrating This Behavior\n\nA clear example of this behavior is shown in [8e03891] where a revenue definition is created and then used in subsequent operations:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. `revenue_def` is defined as a contextless expression\n2. It's used to define `line_price` in a nested `CALCULATE`\n3. `total_line_price` is defined in the outer `CALCULATE`\n4. `total_line_price` is then available for reference in the subsequent `CALCULATE` operation on the lines collection\n\n## Bad Example Showing the Limitation\n\nThe documentation [b320089] provides a clear \"Bad Example\" that illustrates this limitation:\n\n```py\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n  first_name,\n  last_name,\n  total_cost=SUM(packages.package_cost),\n  n_packages=COUNT(packages),\n  ratio=total_cost/n_packages,\n)\n```\n\nThis is marked as invalid because:\n> \"This is invalid the `total_cost` and `n_packages` are used to define `ratio` in the same `CALCULATE` where they are defined.\"\n\n## Best Practices for Working with Calculated Fields\n\nTo work around this limitation, the documentation [b320089] suggests using multiple `CALCULATE` operations in sequence:\n\n```py\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n  total_cost=SUM(packages.package_cost),\n  n_packages=COUNT(packages),\n).CALCULATE(\n  first_name,\n  last_name,\n  ratio=total_cost/n_packages,\n)\n```\n\nThis pattern allows you to define intermediate fields in one `CALCULATE` and then use them in subsequent operations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn PyDough, fields defined within a `CALCULATE` expression become available for reference:\n1. After the `CALCULATE` operation completes\n2. In subsequent operations on the same collection\n3. In operations on descendant collections\n\nThey are not available for reference within the same `CALCULATE` block where they are defined, which is an important limitation to understand when working with PyDough."}]}]}

This is a fundamental concept in PyDough's data model.\n\nAs stated in [edc4690]:\n\n> \"Aggregation functions are a special set of functions that, when called on their inputs, convert them from plural to singular.\"\n\n## The Plural vs. Singular Problem\n\nThe documentation explains the core issue that aggregation functions solve [edc4690]:\n\n> \"When terms of a plural sub-collection are accessed, those terms are plural with regards to the current collection. For example, if each nation in `Nations` has multiple `customers`, and each customer has a single `acctbal`, then `customers.acctbal` is plural with regards to `Nations` and cannot be used in any calculations when the current context is `Nations`. The exception to this is when `customers.acctbal` is made singular with regards to `Nations` by aggregating it.\"\n\nThis means that when you're working with a collection that has a one-to-many relationship with another collection, you can't directly use the properties of the \"many\" side in calculations unless you first aggregate them into a single value.\n\n## Examples of Aggregation Functions\n\nThe documentation provides examples of aggregation functions [edc4690]:\n\n### SUM\n```py\nNations.CALCULATE(total_consumer_wealth = SUM(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\n### AVG\n```py\nNations.CALCULATE(avg_consumer_wealth = AVG(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\n## Alternative to Aggregation: SINGULAR()\n\nIn some cases, when you know that a plural relationship will actually only contain one record per parent (due to filtering or other constraints), you can use the `.SINGULAR()` modifier instead of aggregation [edc4690]:\n\n```py\nmost_recent_package = packages.WHERE(\n    RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1) == 1\n).SINGULAR()\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    first_name,\n    middle_name,\n    last_name,\n    most_recent_package_cost=most_recent_package.package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThe documentation warns that `.SINGULAR()` should only be used when you're certain the data will be singular, as otherwise it can result in undefined behavior [edc4690].\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that aggregation functions are necessary when working with plural relationships. It's a best practice to use aggregation functions when accessing properties from a one-to-many relationship, rather than trying to access them directly.\n\nFrom [988171e], we can see a practical example of how aggregation functions are used in PyDough:\n\n```py\nresult = People.CALCULATE(\n    name,\n    net_income = SUM(jobs.income_earned) - SUM(schools.tuition_paid)\n)\n```\n\nThis example shows how aggregation functions (SUM) are used to convert plural values (jobs.income_earned and schools.tuition_paid) into singular values that can be used in calculations.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe fundamental role of aggregation functions in PyDough is to convert plural values (from one-to-many relationships) into singular values that can be used in calculations. This is a core concept in PyDough's data model and is essential for working with hierarchical data structures."}]}]}

Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\n\n## The Invalid Example in Question\n\nThe specific bad example being referenced is Bad Example #7 in the PARTITION section [2ba30a5]:\n\n```py\nPARTITION(People.CALCULATE(birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)), name=\"ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    email,\n    n_people=COUNT(ppl)\n)\n```\n\nThe documentation explicitly states why this is invalid:\n\n> Invalid because the `email` property is referenced, which is not one of the partition keys, even though the data being partitioned does have an `email` property.\n\n## Why This Is Invalid\n\nThe key reason this example is invalid relates to how PARTITION works in Pydough:\n\n1. When you partition data, the resulting collection only has access to:\n   - The partitioning keys themselves (in this case, only `birth_year`)\n   - The partitioned data as a subcollection (in this case, `ppl`)\n\n2. Even though the original data (`People`) has an `email` property, the partitioned collection doesn't directly inherit all properties from the original data - it only has access to the specific partition keys.\n\n3. To access other properties like `email`, you must access them through the partitioned subcollection (in this case, `ppl`).\n\n## How to Fix This Issue\n\nTo correctly access the `email` property, you would need to either:\n\n1. Include `email` as one of the partition keys, or\n2. Access `email` through the partitioned subcollection (e.g., using an aggregation function like `FIRST(ppl.email)`)\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThis example highlights several important Pydough best practices:\n\n1. **Understand property accessibility**: After partitioning, only partition keys are directly accessible at the partition level.\n\n2. **Use proper data flow**: Properties from the original collection must be accessed through the partitioned subcollection.\n\n3. **Follow the hierarchical model**: Pydough enforces a strict hierarchical model where properties are only accessible at their defined level or through proper relationships.\n\n## Comparison with Valid Examples\n\nLooking at Good Example #2 [2ba30a5], we can see the proper pattern:\n\n```py\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\nHere, only `state` (the partition key) and aggregations over the partitioned subcollection (`addrs`) are used in the CALCULATE clause.\n\nThis pattern ensures that the hierarchical data model is maintained and that properties are accessed at the appropriate level in the data hierarchy."}]}]}

This means that when you're working with a collection, you can only include expressions in CALCULATE that yield a single value per record in that collection [e67e9de].\n\nAs stated in the documentation:\n\n> The value of one of these terms in a `CALCULATE` must be expressions that are singular with regards to the current context.

For example, if each nation in `Nations` has multiple `customers`, and each customer has a single `acctbal`, then `customers.acctbal` is plural with regards to `Nations` and cannot be used directly in CALCULATE when the current context is `Nations`.\n\n## What Makes an Expression Singular?\n\nAccording to the documentation [e67e9de], an expression is singular when it is:\n\n1. A scalar property of the current collection\n2. A literal value\n3. A singular expression from a sub-collection that is singular with respect to the current collection\n4. A non-aggregation function called on other singular expressions\n5. An aggregation function called on a plural expression (which converts it to singular)\n\n## Examples of Valid Singular Expressions in CALCULATE\n\n```python\n# Referencing scalar properties of the current collection\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name\n)\n\n# Referencing scalar properties of a singular sub-collection\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    current_state=current_address.state\n)\n\n# Invoking normal functions/operations on other singular data\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    lowered_name=LOWER(name),\n    normalized_birth_month=MONTH(birth_date) - 1,\n    lives_in_c_state=STARTSWITH(current_address.state, \"C\")\n)\n\n# Invoking aggregation functions on plural data\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages),\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.package_cost),\n    n_states_shipped_to=NDISTINCT(packages.shipping_address.state)\n)\n```\n[e67e9de]\n\n## Examples of Invalid Plural Expressions in CALCULATE\n\nThe documentation provides several examples of invalid uses of CALCULATE due to plural expressions:\n\n```python\n# Bad Example #3: For each person, list the address_id of packages they have ordered. \n# This is invalid because `packages` is a plural property of `People`, so its properties \n# cannot be included in a `CALCULATE` term of `People` unless aggregated.\nPeople.CALCULATE(packages.address_id)\n\n# Bad Example #4: For each person, list their first/last name followed by the concatenated \n# city/state name of their current address. This is invalid because `current_address` is a \n# plural property of `People`, so its properties cannot be included in a `CALCULATE` term \n# of `People` unless aggregated.\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    location=JOIN_STRINGS(\", \", current_address.city, current_address.state)\n)\n```\n[e67e9de]\n\n## Making Plural Data Singular\n\nThere are two main ways to make plural data singular in PyDough:\n\n### 1. Using Aggregation Functions\n\nAggregation functions are special functions that convert plural expressions to singular ones [4766684]:\n\n```python\n# For every person, find their full name (without the middle name) and count how many packages they purchased.\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    name=JOIN_STRINGS(\"\", first_name, last_name),\n    n_packages_ordered=COUNT(packages)\n)\n```\n[e67e9de]\n\nCommon aggregation functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and NDISTINCT.\n\n### 2. Using the SINGULAR() Modifier\n\nThe SINGULAR() modifier tells PyDough to treat plural data as singular [edc4690]:\n\n```python\n# Access the package cost of the most recent package ordered by each person\nmost_recent_package = packages.WHERE(\n    RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1) == 1\n).SINGULAR()\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    first_name,\n    middle_name,\n    last_name,\n    most_recent_package_cost=most_recent_package.package_cost\n)\n```\n[edc4690]\n\nHowever, the documentation emphasizes that SINGULAR() should only be used when you are certain the data will be singular, as otherwise it can result in undefined behavior [edc4690].\n\n## Best Practices for Handling Singular vs. Plural Expressions\n\n1. **Use aggregation functions** when working with plural sub-collections to make them singular\n2. **Use SINGULAR() carefully** and only when you're certain the data will be singular\n3. **Be aware of relationships** between collections in your data model\n4. **Use WHERE filters** to narrow down plural collections to singular ones before using SINGULAR()\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe CALCULATE function in PyDough requires all expressions to be singular with respect to the current context. This limitation ensures that each record in the result has exactly one value for each calculated expression. When working with plural sub-collections, you must either use aggregation functions to make them singular or carefully use the SINGULAR() modifier when appropriate."}]}]}

It can calculate:\n- The global average across all rows\n- The average of rows per an ancestor of a sub-collection\n\nThe function signature is:\n```python\nRELAVG(expression, levels=None)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `expression`: the singular expression to take the average of across multiple rows\n- `levels` (optional): default is `None`, specifies the levels argument as used in other window functions [80fba2b]\n\n## Examples from Documentation\n\nThe documentation [80fba2b] provides two clear examples of how to use `RELAVG`:\n\n```python\n# Finds all customers whose account balance is above the global average of all\n# customers' account balances.\nCustomers.WHERE(acctbal > RELAVG(acctbal))\n\n# Finds all customers whose account balance is above the average of all\n# customers' account balances within that nation.\nNations.customers.WHERE(acctbal > RELAVG(acctbal, levels=1))\n```\n\n## How RELAVG Works in PyDough's Data Flow\n\nThe `RELAVG` function is part of PyDough's window functions, similar to other functions like `RELSUM` [80fba2b]. These functions allow for calculations across multiple rows within a collection context.\n\nIn PyDough's hierarchical data model:\n1. When used without specifying levels, `RELAVG` calculates the global average across all rows in the current collection\n2. When specifying levels (e.g., `levels=1`), it calculates the average within a specific hierarchical context (like all customers within a nation)\n\n## PyDough Conventions and Best Practices\n\nThe `RELAVG` function follows PyDough's convention of using uppercase for built-in functions [988171e]. It's part of PyDough's approach to expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking.\n\nThe function demonstrates PyDough's ability to simplify complex SQL operations. For example, calculating averages across different grouping levels would typically require complex subqueries or window functions in SQL, but PyDough provides a more intuitive syntax [988171e].\n\n## Comparison with Other PyDough Functions\n\n`RELAVG` is similar to other relational aggregation functions in PyDough:\n- `RELSUM`: Returns the sum of multiple rows [80fba2b]\n- `AVG`: Takes the average of a plural set of numerical values [4766684]\n\nThe key difference is that `RELAVG` works on singular expressions across multiple rows within the same collection, while `AVG` aggregates plural values into a singular value.\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked what calculation the `RELAVG(expression, per=...)` function performs. Based on the documentation, `RELAVG` calculates the average of a singular expression across multiple rows in a collection. However, it's worth noting that the parameter in the documentation is `levels` rather than `per` as mentioned in the question [80fba2b].\n\nThe function is particularly useful for comparing individual values against averages, such as finding customers with above-average account balances, either globally or within specific hierarchical contexts."}]}]}

The examples in the search results show that the `by` parameter typically takes column references or simple expressions, but not aggregate functions like `SUM()`.\n\n## PyDough PARTITION Function Explanation\n\n### What is PARTITION\n\nThe `PARTITION` function in PyDough is used to group data for aggregation purposes, similar to a GROUP BY in SQL. From the search results, we can see several examples of how PARTITION is used.\n\n### Syntax and Usage\n\nFrom the examples in the search results, the typical pattern for using PARTITION is:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(collection, name=\"alias_name\", by=(column1, column2, ...))\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `collection` is the data collection to partition\n- `name` is an alias for referencing the partitioned data\n- `by` specifies the columns to partition by\n\n## Examples from Search Results\n\n### Example 1: Basic PARTITION Usage [988171e]\n\nIn Query 3, PARTITION is used to group line items by order information:\n\n```python\noutput = PARTITION(\n  selected_lines, name=\"l\", by=(order_key, order_date, ship_priority)\n).CALCULATE(\n  L_ORDERKEY=order_key,\n  REVENUE=SUM(l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)),\n  O_ORDERDATE=order_date,\n  O_SHIPPRIORITY=ship_priority,\n).TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))\n```\n\nHere, the `by` parameter contains simple column references: `order_key`, `order_date`, and `ship_priority`.\n\n### Example 2: PARTITION with Simple Expressions [8fab0d9]\n\n```python\noutput = PARTITION(customer_info, name=\"custs\", by=num_non_special_orders).CALCULATE(\n  C_COUNT=num_non_special_orders, CUSTDIST=COUNT(custs)\n).ORDER_BY(CUSTDIST.DESC(), C_COUNT.DESC())\n```\n\nIn this example, `num_non_special_orders` is used in the `by` parameter, which is a column reference, not an aggregate calculation.\n\n### Example 3: PARTITION with Part Key [cebf990]\n\n```python\noutput = TPCH.CALCULATE(min_market_share=SUM(selected_records.metric) * 0.0001).PARTITION(\n  selected_records, name=\"ps\", by=part_key\n).CALCULATE(\n  PS_PARTKEY=part_key, VALUE=SUM(ps.metric)\n).WHERE(VALUE > min_market_share).ORDER_BY(VALUE.DESC())\n```\n\nAgain, the `by` parameter uses a simple column reference (`part_key`), not an aggregate function.\n\n## Sorting vs. Partitioning\n\nIt's important to note the difference between partitioning and sorting in PyDough:\n\n1. In the `TOP_K` function, the `by` parameter is used for sorting and can contain complex expressions including calculations with `ASC()` and `DESC()` modifiers [988171e]:\n\n```python\n.TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))\n```\n\n2. In contrast, the `by` parameter of `PARTITION` appears to be used for grouping data, similar to SQL's GROUP BY, and the examples show it taking column references rather than aggregate calculations.\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\nFrom the examples, we can infer these PyDough best practices:\n\n1. Use `PARTITION` for grouping data before performing aggregations with `CALCULATE`\n2. Use simple column references or expressions in the `by` parameter of `PARTITION`\n3. Perform aggregate calculations like `SUM()` in the `CALCULATE` function that follows `PARTITION`\n4. Use aliases (via the `name` parameter) to reference the partitioned data in subsequent operations\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided search results, there is no evidence that aggregate calculations like `SUM(lines.extended_price)` can be performed directly within the `by` parameter of `PARTITION`. The examples consistently show that the `by` parameter takes column references or simple expressions, while aggregate functions are used in the `CALCULATE` method that follows the `PARTITION` operation."}]}]}

Window functions in PyDough have an optional `levels` argument that determines the scope of the ranking:\n\n```python\n# (no levels) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(...))\n\n# (levels=1) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same nation\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=1))\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using PARTITION with RANKING, the data flow works as follows:\n\n1. First, the data is grouped using `PARTITION` based on specified keys\n2. Then, within each partition group, the `RANKING` function can be applied to rank items\n3. The ranking is performed based on the criteria specified in the `by` parameter of the RANKING function\n\n## PyDough Best Practices\n\nFrom the search results, we can identify these best practices:\n- Use meaningful names for the partitioned data (via the `name` parameter) [7330190]\n- When partitioning, use only references to expressions that already exist in the context of the data [3f7d77d]\n- For ranking within groups, specify the ordering criteria clearly using the `by` parameter [e67e9de]\n\n## PyDough Conventions\n\nThe pattern follows PyDough's method chaining convention:\n1. Start with a collection\n2. Apply PARTITION to group the data\n3. Use CALCULATE with RANKING to rank items within each group\n\n## Example from Search Results\n\nWhile there isn't a direct example of using RANKING within PARTITION in the search results, we can infer the pattern from the window function documentation [e67e9de] and PARTITION examples [7330190].\n\nA conceptual example would look like:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(collection_data, name=\"partitioned_data\", by=grouping_key).CALCULATE(\n    grouping_key,\n    rank_within_group=RANKING(by=some_value.DESC())\n)\n```\n\nThis would rank items within each partition group based on the specified ordering criteria.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo rank items within each group created by `PARTITION`, use the `RANKING` window function inside the `CALCULATE` that follows the `PARTITION` operation. The `RANKING` function allows you to specify the ordering criteria using the `by` parameter, and it will rank items within the scope defined by the partition."}]}]}

Every unique combination of values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection include:\n1. The partitioning terms themselves\n2. A single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data\n\n## Important Constraints\n\nPyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys [2ba30a5]. You cannot use:\n- An ancestor term\n- A term from a child collection\n- The result of a function call\n\n## Data Flow and Inheritance\n\nWhen partitioned data is accessed [2ba30a5]:\n- Its original ancestry is lost\n- It inherits the ancestry from the `PARTITION` clause\n- The default ancestor of `PARTITION` (if not specified) is the entire graph\n- The partitioned data still has access to any down-streamed terms from its original ancestry\n\n## Examples of Valid PARTITION Usage\n\n**Example 1**: Find every unique state [2ba30a5]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(state)\n```\n\n**Example 2**: For every state, count how many addresses are in that state [2ba30a5]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\n**Example 3**: For every city/state, count how many people live in that city/state [2ba30a5]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    city,\n    n_people=COUNT(addrs.current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\n**Example 4**: Find the top 5 years with the most people born in that year who have yahoo email accounts [2ba30a5]\n```python\nyahoo_people = People.CALCULATE(\n    birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)\n).WHERE(ENDSWITH(email, \"@yahoo.com\"))\n\nPARTITION(yahoo_people, name=\"yah_ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    n_people=COUNT(yah_ppl)\n).TOP_K(5, by=n_people.DESC())\n```\n\n## Common Errors and Invalid Usage\n\n**Bad Example 1**: Partitioning a non-existent collection [7330190]\n```python\nPARTITION(Products, name=\"p\", by=product_type)\n```\n\n**Bad Example 2**: Missing the required `name` parameter [7330190]\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, by=state)\n```\n\n**Bad Example 3**: Missing the required `by` parameter [7330190]\n```python\nPARTITION(People, name=\"ppl\")\n```\n\n**Bad Example 4**: Using a function call directly as a partition key [7330190]\n```python\nPARTITION(Packages, name=\"packs\", by=YEAR(order_date)).CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages)\n)\n```\nThis is invalid because function calls like `YEAR(order_date)` must first be placed in a `CALCULATE` clause to make them accessible as named references.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Always provide both the `name` and `by` parameters [7330190]\n2. When using complex expressions as partition keys, first use `CALCULATE` to create named references [7330190]\n3. For multiple partition keys, use a tuple: `by=(key1, key2)` [2ba30a5]\n4. Remember that partitioned data can access down-streamed terms from its original ancestry [2ba30a5]\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `PARTITION` syntax in PyDough, including its structure, constraints, and examples of both valid and invalid usage."}]}]}

This function allows you to filter collections based on specified conditions.\n\n### Basic Syntax\n\nThe basic syntax for filtering data in PyDough is:\n\n```python\ncollection.WHERE(condition)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `collection` is the collection you want to filter\n- `condition` is a boolean expression that determines which records to include\n\n## Examples of Filtering in PyDough\n\nFrom the search results, we can see examples of filtering in action:\n\nFrom [da99528], we can see that PyDough allows filtering with the `WHERE` function:\n\n```python\nnations.suppliers.WHERE(account_balance > 0)\n```\n\nThis filters the suppliers subcollection of nations to only include suppliers with an account balance greater than 0.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen filtering data in PyDough:\n\n1. You start with a collection (like `nations` or `customers`)\n2. You can navigate to subcollections using dot notation (like `nations.suppliers`)\n3. You apply the `WHERE` function with a condition to filter the records\n4. The result is a new filtered collection that only contains records matching the condition\n\nThis approach follows PyDough's hierarchical thinking model [7ea5a7b], which abstracts away joins in favor of thinking about logical relationships between collections and sub-collections.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices for Filtering\n\nFrom the documentation, we can infer these best practices:\n\n1. Use the hierarchical model to navigate between collections before filtering\n2. Write conditions that are clear and directly relate to the business question\n3. Leverage PyDough's ability to abstract away complex join logic when filtering related data\n\n## How PyDough Filtering Follows Conventions\n\nPyDough filtering follows the convention of using a clear, declarative syntax that resembles natural language. As noted in [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> When a question is being asked, the PyDough code to answer it will look more similar to the text of the question than the SQL text would.\n\nThis makes filtering in PyDough more intuitive than writing equivalent SQL WHERE clauses and JOIN statements.\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about the syntax for filtering data in PyDough. The answer provides the core syntax using the `WHERE` function and demonstrates how it's used in context with collections and subcollections.\n\nPyDough's filtering approach is part of what makes it powerful for analytics, as it allows users to express filtering logic in a way that's closer to how they think about the data relationships, rather than having to understand the underlying SQL join logic."}]}]}

It's particularly useful when working with one-to-many relationships to avoid errors when a collection might be empty.\n\nFrom the search results, we can see an example of `HAS` being used in a WHERE clause:\n\n```python\nAddresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants)).CALCULATE(\n  city,\n  state,\n  n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants),\n)\n```\n[0e98bac]\n\n## How `HAS` Helps with One-to-Many Relationships\n\nWhen navigating one-to-many relationships in PyDough, you might encounter situations where a parent record has no related child records. This can cause issues when performing aggregations or other operations on those child records.\n\nThe `HAS` function helps by:\n\n1. **Filtering out empty collections**: By using `HAS` in a WHERE clause, you can filter out parent records that don't have any related child records before performing operations on those child records.\n\n2. **Preventing errors**: Without checking if a collection has records first, operations on empty collections might lead to errors or unexpected results.\n\n## Example of `HAS` in Practice\n\nIn the example from [0e98bac], the code is filtering addresses to only include those that have current occupants before calculating the number of occupants:\n\n```python\nAddresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants)).CALCULATE(\n  city,\n  state,\n  n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants),\n)\n```\n\nThis ensures that only addresses with at least one occupant are included in the result. Without the `HAS` check, addresses with no occupants would still be included, potentially causing confusion or requiring additional handling.\n\n## Best Practices with `HAS`\n\nBased on the search results, we can infer some best practices when using `HAS`:\n\n1. **Use `HAS` before aggregations**: When you plan to perform aggregations on a one-to-many relationship, use `HAS` to filter out empty collections first.\n\n2. **Combine with WHERE clauses**: `HAS` is often used within a WHERE clause to filter collections before further processing.\n\n3. **Use for conditional logic**: `HAS` can be used to create conditional logic based on whether a collection has records or not.\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked how the `HAS` function helps in handling potential errors or empty sets when navigating one-to-many relationships before performing aggregations.\n\nThe `HAS` function directly addresses this by providing a way to check if a collection has any records before attempting to perform operations on it. This prevents errors that might occur when trying to aggregate empty collections and ensures that your results only include records that have the relationships you're interested in.\n\nBy using `HAS` in a WHERE clause, you can filter out parent records that don't have any related child records, ensuring that your aggregations only operate on valid data and preventing potential errors or unexpected results."}]}]}

Based on the search results provided, I can explain this rule and how it works in PyDough.\n\n## The Rule on Nesting Aggregation Functions\n\nAccording to the search results, PyDough has a specific rule about nesting aggregation functions:\n\n**Aggregation functions cannot be nested within other aggregation functions.**\n\nThis is a fundamental constraint in PyDough's design that affects how data transformations can be structured.\n\n## PyDough Aggregation Functions\n\nAggregation functions in PyDough are special functions that convert plural (multiple) values into singular values [8e03891]. Some examples of aggregation functions include:\n\n- `SUM`: Returns the sum of a plural set of numerical values\n- `AVG`: Takes the average of a plural set of numerical values\n- `COUNT`: Counts the number of records in a collection\n- `MIN`/`MAX`: Returns the minimum/maximum value in a collection\n- `HAS`: Checks if a collection has any records\n- `NDISTINCT`: Counts the number of distinct values\n\n## Why This Rule Matters\n\nThe rule against nesting aggregation functions is important because:\n\n1. Aggregation functions convert plural data to singular data [e67e9de]\n2. Once data has been aggregated, it's already singular, so applying another aggregation wouldn't make logical sense in PyDough's data model\n\n## Example of Correct Usage\n\nInstead of nesting aggregation functions, PyDough encourages a hierarchical approach to data transformation. For example, from [e67e9de]:\n\n```python\n# Invoking aggregation functions on plural data\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages),\n    home_has_had_packages_billed=HAS(current_address.billed_packages),\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.package_cost),\n    n_states_shipped_to=NDISTINCT(packages.shipping_address.state),\n    most_recent_package_ordered=MAX(packages.order_date),\n)\n```\n\n## Example of Revenue Calculation Without Nesting\n\nIn a more complex example [8e03891], we can see how calculations are structured to avoid nesting aggregation functions:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SUM` aggregation is applied to `line_price`, but no other aggregation function is nested inside it.\n\n## PyDough's Approach to Data Transformation\n\nPyDough uses a hierarchical thinking approach to data transformation [988171e], which is closer to human linguistics than a relational model. This approach allows for more intuitive expression of analytical questions.\n\nThe rule against nesting aggregation functions is part of PyDough's design to maintain this intuitive approach while ensuring that data transformations follow a logical flow from plural to singular contexts.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe stated rule in PyDough is that aggregation functions cannot be nested within other aggregation functions.

According to the documentation [988171e], the `PARTITION` function has the following syntax:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data`: The PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name`: A string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by`: Either a single partitioning key or an iterable of one or more partitioning keys\n\n## Significance of the `name` Parameter\n\nThe `name` parameter in the `PARTITION` function serves a critical purpose:\n\n1. **Subcollection Access**: As stated in [3f7d77d], \"The `name` argument specifies the name of the subcollection access from the partitions to the original unpartitioned data.\"\n\n2. **Required Parameter**: The `name` parameter is mandatory. As shown in [7330190], not providing a valid `name` when partitioning is considered invalid:\n   ```python\n   # Bad Example #2: Does not provide a valid `name` when partitioning `Addresses` by the state.\n   PARTITION(Addresses, by=state)\n   ```\n\n3. **Reference for Aggregations**: The name provides a way to reference the original data when performing aggregations on the partitioned data.\n\n## Examples Demonstrating Usage\n\n### Example 1: Grouping Nations by Name Length [3f7d77d]\n\n```python\nupdated_nations = nations.CALCULATE(key, name_length=LENGTH(name))\ngrouped_nations = PARTITION(\n  updated_nations, name=\"n\", by=(name_length)\n).CALCULATE(\n  name_length,\n  nation_count=COUNT(n.key)\n)\npydough.to_df(grouped_nations)\n```\n\nIn this example, `\"n\"` is the name parameter that allows accessing the original data within the partition.\n\n### Example 2: Counting People with Yahoo Email Accounts by Birth Year [7b73db5]\n\n```python\nyahoo_people = People.CALCULATE(\n    birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)\n).WHERE(ENDSWITH(email, \"@yahoo.com\"))\n\nPARTITION(yahoo_people, name=\"yah_ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    n_people=COUNT(yah_ppl)\n).TOP_K(5, by=n_people.DESC())\n```\n\nHere, `\"yah_ppl\"` is the name parameter that allows counting the people in each birth year partition.\n\n### Example 3: Finding Packages Below Average Cost [7b73db5]\n\n```python\npackage_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_year=YEAR(order_date), order_month=MONTH(order_date))\n\nPARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n).packs.WHERE(\n    package_cost < avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, `\"packs\"` allows accessing the original package data to filter for packages below the average cost.\n\n## Data Flow and Best Practices\n\nThe `name` parameter facilitates a specific data flow pattern in PyDough:\n\n1. Data is partitioned by specified keys\n2. The partitioned data can be accessed using the provided name\n3. Aggregations can be performed on the partitioned data\n4. The original data can be filtered or transformed based on these aggregations\n\nThis pattern is particularly powerful because:\n\n- It allows for \"down-streaming\" of terms defined at the `PARTITION` level to its descendants [3f7d77d]\n- It enables complex filtering based on aggregate calculations\n- It maintains the hierarchical relationship between the partitioned and original data\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `name` parameter in PyDough's `PARTITION` function is essential for creating a named reference to access the original unpartitioned data within the context of each partition. This enables powerful data transformations where aggregations at the partition level can influence operations on the individual records, following PyDough's hierarchical data model approach."}]}]}

The `levels` parameter in both functions allows for controlling the scope of counting - whether to count globally or within a specific hierarchical level.\n\nThe key distinction is that `RELCOUNT` allows you to count only records where a specific expression is non-null, while `RELSIZE` simply counts all records regardless of null values.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices\n\nThe examples demonstrate PyDough's hierarchical thinking model, where calculations can be performed at different levels of the data hierarchy. This aligns with PyDough's design philosophy mentioned in [988171e], which allows \"expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking.\"\n\nThe examples also show how PyDough enables concise expression of complex analytical operations that would require more verbose SQL queries."}]}]}

It can be used with dot syntax to step from a parent collection to a child collection: `Parent.BEST(child, by=...)`\n2. It can be used as a freestanding accessor inside a collection operator: `Parent(x=BEST(child, by=...).y)`\n3. The original ancestry of the sub-collection is preserved, maintaining any down-streaming\n4. By default, it returns a single optimal record, but this behavior can be modified\n\n## Additional Parameters\n\nThe `BEST` function supports additional parameters [aed8f9e]:\n\n- `allow_ties` (default=False): When set to True, it keeps all records that share the optimal values\n- `n_best` (default=1): When set to an integer greater than 1, it keeps the top n values of the sub-collection\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using `BEST`:\n1. The function evaluates each record in the sub-collection according to the collation terms\n2. It selects the optimal record(s) based on those terms\n3. The selected record(s) can then be used in further calculations or operations\n\n## Examples from Documentation\n\nHere are some examples from the documentation [aed8f9e] that demonstrate how to use `BEST`:\n\n**Example 1**: Find the package ID and zip code for every package that was the first-ever purchase for the customer:\n```python\nCustomers.BEST(packages, by=order_date.ASC()).CALCULATE(\n    package_id,\n    shipping_address.zip_code\n)\n```\n\n**Example 2**: For each customer, list their SSN and the cost of the most recent package they purchased:\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    most_recent_cost=BEST(packages, by=order_date.DESC()).package_cost\n)\n```\n\n**Example 4**: For each customer, find the number of people currently living in the address that they most recently shipped a package to:\n```python\nmost_recent_package = BEST(packages, by=order_date.DESC())\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    n_occ_most_recent_addr=COUNT(most_recent_package.shipping_address.current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\n## Comparison with TOP_K\n\nWhile `TOP_K` [efa530c] is used to sort a collection and select the first k values globally, `BEST` [aed8f9e] allows you to find optimal records within sub-collections on a per-record basis of the parent collection.\n\nThe key difference is that `TOP_K` operates on the entire collection, while `BEST` operates on sub-collections relative to each record in the parent collection.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices\n\nThe documentation demonstrates several best practices:\n\n1. Using descriptive variable names for clarity\n2. Separating complex operations into multiple steps when appropriate\n3. Leveraging PyDough's hierarchical thinking model to express relationships between collections\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about alternatives to `TOP_K` within `CALCULATE` for identifying top-ranked items. The `BEST` function provides this alternative by allowing selection of optimal records from sub-collections based on specified criteria, which can be used within `CALCULATE` operations to identify and work with top-ranked items in a more flexible way than `TOP_K`."}]}]}

Based on the provided documentation, I'll explain the key differences between these operations and when `TOP_K` is specifically required.\n\n## Key Differences Between TOP_K and ORDER_BY\n\n### ORDER_BY Function\n\nAccording to the documentation [9c4448e], `ORDER_BY` is an operation that sorts PyDough collections:\n\n```python\n# Basic syntax\nCollection.ORDER_BY(collation_terms)\n```\n\nThe `ORDER_BY` operation:\n- Sorts a collection based on specified collation terms\n- Preserves all records in the collection\n- Only changes the order of records, not which ones are kept/dropped\n- Requires 1+ expressions that can be inside a `CALCULATE` term\n\n### TOP_K Function\n\nFrom [efa530c], `TOP_K` is described as:\n\n```python\n# Basic syntax\nCollection.TOP_K(k, by=collation_terms)\n```\n\nThe `TOP_K` operation:\n- Sorts a collection (like `ORDER_BY`)\n- Additionally limits the result to only the first `k` values\n- Requires a positive integer `k` and collation terms\n- Has the same restrictions as `ORDER_BY` regarding collation terms\n\n## When TOP_K Must Be Used Instead of ORDER_BY\n\nBased on the documentation, `TOP_K` must be used instead of `ORDER_BY` in the following specific circumstances:\n\n1. **When you need to limit the number of results**: If you need only a specific number of top/bottom records rather than the entire sorted collection [efa530c].\n\n2. **For optimization purposes**: When you're only interested in a small subset of the sorted data, using `TOP_K` can be more efficient than sorting the entire collection with `ORDER_BY` and then filtering.\n\n3. **For ranking-based queries**: When you specifically need the \"top k\" or \"bottom k\" elements according to some criteria.\n\n## Examples from Documentation\n\n### Example 1: Finding top performers\n\nFrom [efa530c]:\n```python\n# Find the 10 people who have ordered the most packages\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    birth_date,\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages)\n).TOP_K(10, by=(n_packages.DESC(), ssn.ASC()))\n```\n\nThis example shows finding the top 10 people by package count, with ties broken by SSN. This cannot be achieved with `ORDER_BY` alone since it would return all people, not just the top 10.\n\n### Example 2: Finding most recent items\n\nFrom [efa530c]:\n```python\n# Find the 5 most recently shipped packages\nPackages.TOP_K(5, by=order_date.DESC())\n```\n\nThis example retrieves only the 5 most recent packages. Using `ORDER_BY` would return all packages in descending date order.\n\n### Example 3: Finding top spenders\n\nFrom [2ba30a5]:\n```python\n# Find the top 3 people who have spent the most money on packages\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    total_package_cost=SUM(packages.package_cost)\n).TOP_K(3, by=total_package_cost.DESC())\n```\n\nThis example shows finding the top 3 people by total spending. Using `ORDER_BY` would return all people sorted by spending, not just the top 3.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices and Conventions\n\n1. **Configuration options**: Both `TOP_K` and `ORDER_BY` respect the same configuration settings [efa530c]:\n   - `collation_default_asc` (default=True): Controls default sort direction\n   - `propagate_collation` (default=False): Controls whether collation is propagated\n\n2. **Collation expressions**: Both functions use expressions with `.ASC()` or `.DESC()` to indicate sort direction [9c4448e].\n\n3. **Tie-breaking**: Both allow multiple collation terms to handle ties, processing them in order until there are no more terms [9c4448e].\n\n## Summary\n\n`TOP_K` must be used instead of `ORDER_BY` when you need to:\n1. Limit the number of results to a specific count\n2. Retrieve only the top/bottom k elements according to some criteria\n3. Optimize queries where only a subset of sorted results is needed\n\nIn all other cases where you need the entire sorted collection, `ORDER_BY` is sufficient."}]}]}

This is explicitly stated in the documentation [fcc80aa]:\n\n> \"Once a `CALCULATE` clause is created, all terms of the current collection still exist even if they weren't part of the `CALCULATE` and can still be referenced, they just will not be part of the final answer.\"\n\n## Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns\n\nThe `CALCULATE` operation is a core function in Pydough that allows users to:\n\n1. Select specific properties from records in a collection\n2. Derive new properties via calculated expressions\n3. Create intermediate expressions that can be used in subsequent operations\n\nAs described in [fcc80aa], `CALCULATE` can take both positional and keyword arguments:\n- Positional arguments use the name of the expression if one exists\n- Keyword arguments use the name of the keyword as the name of the output expression\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in Pydough follows these principles:\n\n1. Fields defined in a `CALCULATE` expression become available to descendant contexts through \"down-streaming\" [e67e9de]\n2. Existing fields not included in a `CALCULATE` expression remain accessible for subsequent operations [fcc80aa]\n3. Multiple `CALCULATE` clauses can be chained, with the last one determining what expressions are part of the final answer [fcc80aa]\n\nThis allows for creating intermediate calculations that may not be part of the final output but are needed for other operations.\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nSeveral best practices are demonstrated in the documentation:\n\n1. Using intermediate `CALCULATE` clauses to derive expressions that will be used in subsequent operations [fcc80aa]\n2. Avoiding name conflicts between terms defined in `CALCULATE` and existing properties [e67e9de]\n3. Using contextless expressions to define reusable snippets of PyDough code [b320089]\n\n## Pydough Conventions\n\nThe documentation shows that Pydough follows these conventions:\n\n1. Using `CALCULATE` to specify which fields should be included in the final output\n2. Allowing fields not included in `CALCULATE` to still be referenced in subsequent operations\n3. Using the last `CALCULATE` clause to determine the final output fields\n\n## Examples from the Documentation\n\nHere's a clear example from [fcc80aa] that demonstrates how fields not included in a `CALCULATE` can still be referenced later:\n\n```python\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    has_middle_name=PRESENT(middle_name)\n    full_name_with_middle=JOIN_STRINGS(\" \", first_name, middle_name, last_name),\n    full_name_without_middle=JOIN_STRINGS(\" \", first_name, last_name),\n).CALCULATE(\n    full_name=IFF(has_middle_name, full_name_with_middle, full_name_without_middle),\n    email=email,\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. The first `CALCULATE` creates intermediate expressions (`has_middle_name`, `full_name_with_middle`, `full_name_without_middle`)\n2. These expressions aren't part of the final output but are used in the second `CALCULATE`\n3. The second `CALCULATE` determines the final output fields (`full_name` and `email`)\n4. Note that `email` is an existing field that wasn't included in the first `CALCULATE` but is still accessible in the second one\n\nAnother example from [8e03891] shows how intermediate calculations can be used in subsequent operations:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how `revenue_def` is defined once and then used in multiple places in the query."}]}]}

Window functions appear in the context of the `CALCULATE` operation [e67e9de].\n\n### Basic Window Function Syntax\n\nFrom the search results [e67e9de], we can see examples of window functions being used:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    cust_ranking=RANKING(by=COUNT(packages).DESC()),\n    cust_percentile=PERCENTILE(by=COUNT(packages).DESC()),\n)\n```\n\nThese examples show window functions like `RANKING()` and `PERCENTILE()` that take a `by` parameter to specify the ordering.\n\n## Down-Streaming in PyDough\n\nTo understand how ancestor references work, we need to understand PyDough's \"down-streaming\" concept [e67e9de]:\n\n> Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`.\n\nThis means expressions defined in a parent context can be accessed by child contexts, which is essential for understanding how window functions reference ancestors.\n\n## The `per` Argument for Disambiguation\n\nWhile the search results don't explicitly show examples of the `per` argument being used to disambiguate between multiple ancestors with the same name, we can infer its purpose from the context of window functions and PyDough's hierarchical structure.\n\nThe `per` argument would likely be used to specify which ancestor context the window function should use when calculating its results, especially when multiple ancestors have defined the same property name.\n\n## Best Practices for Avoiding Name Conflicts\n\nThe search results [e67e9de] provide guidance on avoiding name conflicts:\n\n> As a result, it is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used.\n\nThis suggests that while the `per` argument might help resolve conflicts, the recommended approach is to avoid naming conflicts in the first place by using unique names for properties in different contexts.\n\n## Examples of Down-Streaming in PyDough\n\nThe search results provide several examples of down-streaming that demonstrate how properties from ancestor contexts are accessed [e67e9de]:\n\n**Good Example #1**: Accessing city and state from an address in its current occupants:\n```python\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    current_city=city, current_state=state\n).current_occupants.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    current_city,\n    current_state=current_state,\n)\n```\n\n**Good Example #2**: Checking if a package is shipped to the current address:\n```python\npackage_info = Addresses.CALCULATE(\n    first_address_id=address_id\n).current_occupants.packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_shipped_to_current_addr=shipping_address.address_id == first_address_id\n)\n```\n\n**Good Example #3**: Comparing package cost to average cost:\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the search results don't provide explicit examples of using the `per` argument to disambiguate between multiple ancestors with the same name, they do explain PyDough's hierarchical model and down-streaming mechanism. The `per` argument would likely be used to specify which ancestor context to use for window function calculations when name conflicts exist.\n\nThe best practice recommended by PyDough is to avoid naming conflicts altogether by using unique names for properties in different contexts."}]}]}

The solution is to use aggregation functions to make them singular.\n\n### Correct Approaches:\n\n1. **Use aggregation functions** to convert plural data to singular:\n   ```python\n   # Invoking aggregation functions on plural data\n   Customers.CALCULATE(\n     n_packages=COUNT(packages),\n     home_has_had_packages_billed=HAS(current_address.billed_packages),\n     avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.package_cost),\n     n_states_shipped_to=NDISTINCT(packages.shipping_address.state),\n     most_recent_package_ordered=MAX(packages.order_date),\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Reference scalar properties of singular sub-collections** [e67e9de]:\n   ```python\n   # Referencing scalar properties of a singular sub-collection\n   People.CALCULATE(\n     current_state=current_address.state,\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Down-streaming** [e67e9de] - When an expression is defined inside a `CALCULATE` call, it becomes available to all descendants:\n   ```python\n   # Referencing properties from the CALCULATE an ancestor collection\n   Addresses.CALCULATE(zip_code).current_occupants.CALCULATE(email).packages.CALCULATE(\n     email, # <- refers to the `email` from `current_occupants`\n     zip_code, # <- refers to the `zip_code` from `Addresses`\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Incorrect Approaches:\n\nThe documentation [e67e9de] provides several examples of incorrect usage:\n\n1. **Directly referencing plural properties** without aggregation:\n   ```python\n   # Bad Example #3: This is invalid because `packages` is a plural property of `People`\n   People.CALCULATE(packages.address_id)\n   ```\n\n2. **Referencing properties of plural sub-collections** without aggregation:\n   ```python\n   # Bad Example #4: This is invalid because `current_address` is a plural property\n   People.CALCULATE(\n     first_name,\n     last_name,\n     location=JOIN_STRINGS(\", \", current_address.city, current_address.state),\n   )\n   ```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use aggregation functions** like `COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `HAS`, and `NDISTINCT` to convert plural data to singular [e67e9de].\n\n2. **Avoid name conflicts** in `CALCULATE` expressions that exist elsewhere in the collections being used [e67e9de].\n\n3. **Use down-streaming carefully** - Only names placed in a `CALCULATE` are available to descendant terms [e67e9de].\n\n4. **Use the `.SINGULAR()` modifier** when appropriate - For cases where filtering ensures a plural collection becomes singular [edc4690].\n\n## Example of Proper Usage\n\nHere's a complete example showing proper handling of plural sub-collections [79d3c82]:\n\n```python\n# For every customer, indicate what percentage of all packages billed to their current address were purchased by that same customer\npackages_billed_home = packages.WHERE(\n  billing_address.address_id == original_address\n)\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n  original_address=current_address.address_id,\n  n_packages=COUNT(current_address.packages_billed_to),\n).CALCULATE(\n  ssn,\n  pct=100.0 * COUNT(packages_billed_home) / n_packages\n)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates:\n1. Proper filtering of a plural collection\n2. Using aggregation (`COUNT`) to make plural data singular\n3. Down-streaming values between `CALCULATE` functions\n\nIn summary, when working with plural sub-collections within a `CALCULATE` function, you must use aggregation functions to convert them to singular values, or reference only singular sub-collections."}]}]}

Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\"\n\nThe syntax for `PARTITION` is:\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of 1+ partitioning keys\n\n## Purpose of PARTITION in Data Analysis\n\nThe `PARTITION` operation serves several important purposes in PyDough:\n\n1. **Grouping data**: It allows you to group records by specific attributes\n2. **Aggregation**: It enables calculations across these groups\n3. **Hierarchical analysis**: It supports multi-level partitioning for complex analyses\n\n## Understanding the Three PARTITION Steps\n\nWhile the search results don't specifically mention a 'Complex Transaction Filtering' example with the three PARTITION steps named `ctt_groups`, `ct_groups`, and `c_groups`, I can explain the general pattern of using multiple PARTITION steps based on the documentation provided.\n\nFrom the examples in [7b73db5], we can see that multiple PARTITION steps are often used to create hierarchical groupings of data. Each PARTITION step creates a new collection that can be used for further analysis or filtering.\n\n### Example of Multiple PARTITION Steps\n\nLooking at the \"Good Example #7\" from [7b73db5], we can see how multiple PARTITION steps work together:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\n\npack_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_month=MONTH(order_date))\n\nmonth_info = PARTITION(pack_info, name=\"packs\", by=order_month).CALCULATE(\n    n_packages=COUNT(packs)\n)\n\nGRAPH.CALCULATE(\n    avg_packages_per_month=AVG(month_info.n_packages)\n).PARTITION(pack_info, name=\"packs\", by=order_month).CALCULATE(\n    month,\n).WHERE(COUNT(packs) > avg_packages_per_month)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. The first PARTITION creates `month_info` by grouping packages by month\n2. The second PARTITION is used after calculating an average, to filter for months with above-average package counts\n\n## Best Practices with PARTITION\n\nThe documentation [7b73db5] highlights several important aspects of using PARTITION effectively:\n\n1. **Naming convention**: Each PARTITION operation should have a meaningful name parameter\n2. **Down-streaming**: Properties from the original collection are still accessible in the partitioned data\n3. **Hierarchical analysis**: Multiple PARTITION steps can be used for complex analyses\n4. **Filtering**: PARTITION can be combined with WHERE for filtering groups\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the specific 'Complex Transaction Filtering' example with `ctt_groups`, `ct_groups`, and `c_groups` is not directly available in the search results, the general purpose of using multiple PARTITION steps would be to:\n\n1. Create different levels of grouping for hierarchical analysis\n2. Enable calculations at different levels of aggregation\n3. Allow for filtering based on aggregated values\n4. Support complex data transformations that require multiple grouping steps\n\nEach PARTITION step would create a new collection with a specific name (like `ctt_groups`, `ct_groups`, and `c_groups`) that can be referenced in subsequent operations, allowing for a step-by-step approach to complex data analysis."}]}]}

Based on the provided search results, I'll explain the key concepts related to this question.\n\n## Down-Streaming in PyDough\n\nThe key prerequisite for using attributes from a previous collection in a subsequent operation in PyDough is that the attribute must be explicitly included in a `CALCULATE` operation in the previous collection. This concept is known as \"down-streaming\" in PyDough.\n\n### Down-Streaming Explained\n\nFrom the search results [a10c3db], PyDough follows a principle where attributes from ancestor collections can only be accessed by descendant collections if they were explicitly included in a `CALCULATE` operation. This is a fundamental concept in PyDough's data flow model.\n\nThe documentation states:\n\n> **Down-Streaming**: A term defined in a `CALCULATE` can be accessed by any descendant collection. This is called \"down-streaming\" the term. The term can be accessed by its name directly, as if it were a property of the descendant collection.\n\n### Examples of Correct Down-Streaming\n\n**Good Example #3** [79d3c82]:\n```py\n%%pydough\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n  is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, `avg_package_cost` is defined in the `CALCULATE` operation on the `Customers` collection, and then it's used in a subsequent operation on the `packages` subcollection.\n\n### Examples of Incorrect Down-Streaming\n\n**Bad Example #3** [79d3c82]:\n```py\n%%pydough\nPeople.packages.CALCULATE(email)\n```\n\nThis example fails because even though `email` is a property of `People`, it was not included in a `CALCULATE` of `People`, so it cannot be accessed by `packages`.\n\n**Bad Example #4** [79d3c82]:\n```py\n%%pydough\nPeople.CALCULATE(my_email=email).packages.CALCULATE(email)\n```\n\nThis example fails because `email` was placed in a `CALCULATE` but was given a different name `my_email`, which means that `my_email` has to be used to access it, instead of `email`.\n\n**Bad Example #5** [79d3c82]:\n```py\n%%pydough\ncust_info = Customers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n)\n\nCustomers.packages.CALCULATE(\n  is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis example fails because even though `cust_info` has defined `avg_package_cost`, the final expression `Customers.packages.CALCULATE(...)` does not have `cust_info` as an ancestor, so it cannot access `avg_package_cost` since it is not part of its own ancestry.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices for Attribute Access\n\nBased on the documentation, here are some best practices for using attributes across collections:\n\n1. Always explicitly include attributes you want to use downstream in a `CALCULATE` operation\n2. Use the exact same name when referencing the attribute downstream\n3. Ensure the collection hierarchy is maintained (ancestry relationship)\n4. Be aware of name conflicts between calculated terms and existing properties\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about prerequisites for using attributes from previous collections. The answer is clear: attributes must be explicitly included in a `CALCULATE` operation in the previous collection to be accessible in subsequent operations. This is a fundamental aspect of PyDough's design that ensures clear data flow and prevents ambiguity in attribute references.\n\nThis approach differs from some other query languages where all attributes might be implicitly available throughout the query. PyDough requires explicit declaration through `CALCULATE` to make attributes available downstream, which promotes clarity and intentional data flow in complex queries."}]}]}

Every unique combination values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection. The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\n\n### Syntax and Requirements for PARTITION\n\nThe syntax for PARTITION [7330190] is:\n```\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of one or more partitioning keys\n\n### Key Constraints for Partition Keys\n\nAn important constraint [7330190] is:\n> PyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys, not an ancestor term, or a term from a child collection, or the result of a function call.\n\n### Referencing Partition Keys in CALCULATE\n\nWhen using `key1` and `key2` as partition keys, they become available in the subsequent `CALCULATE` operation. This is demonstrated in several examples:\n\nFrom [7330190], Good Example #3 shows:\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    city,\n    n_people=COUNT(addrs.current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\nHere, `city` and `state` are used as partition keys and then referenced directly in the `CALCULATE` operation.\n\n### Down-Streaming Behavior\n\nThe documentation [7330190] explains that when a `PARTITION` is created, the partition keys become part of the new collection and are automatically available to be referenced in subsequent operations:\n\n> The terms of the new collection are the partitioning terms, and a single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data.\n\nThis is further supported by the \"Down-Streaming\" section [e67e9de], which explains that expressions defined in a `CALCULATE` are available to all descendants of the current context.\n\n## Answer to the Original Question\n\nBased on the documentation, when you partition by `(key1, key2)` in PyDough:\n\n1. Both `key1` and `key2` must be scalar expressions from the data collection being partitioned (not function calls or references to other collections) [7330190]\n\n2. Both `key1` and `key2` become available as terms in the new partitioned collection [7330190]\n\n3. You can directly reference `key1` and `key2` in the subsequent `CALCULATE` operation without any special syntax [7330190]\n\n4. If you try to redefine `key1` or `key2` in the `CALCULATE` with a different meaning, it would cause an error due to name conflicts [e67e9de]\n\nThis is demonstrated in Good Example #3 [7330190] where `city` and `state` are used as partition keys and then directly referenced in the `CALCULATE` operation.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Use meaningful names for partition keys that clearly indicate their purpose [7330190]\n\n2. Avoid name conflicts between partition keys and other properties in your data model [e67e9de]\n\n3. Remember that partition keys must be scalar expressions from the data collection itself [7330190]\n\n4. When using multiple partition keys, group them in a tuple like `by=(key1, key2)` [7330190]"}]}]}

However, based on the documentation provided, the correct parameter name is actually `levels`, not `per`. The `levels` parameter serves the purpose of defining the grouping scope for window functions.\n\n## PyDough Window Functions and the `levels` Parameter\n\nAccording to the documentation [a172ab8], PyDough window functions have an optional `levels` parameter that determines the scope of records to which the window function applies:\n\n> Window functions in PyDough have an optional `levels` argument. If this argument is omitted, it means that the window function applies to all records of the current collection (e.g. rank all customers). If it is provided, it should be a value that can be used as an argument to `BACK`, and in that case it means that the set of values used by the window function should be per-record of the correspond ancestor (e.g. rank all customers within each nation).\n\n## Examples from the Documentation\n\nThe documentation [a172ab8] provides clear examples of how the `levels` parameter works with the `RANKING` function:\n\n```py\n# (no levels) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(...))\n\n# (levels=1) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same nation\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=1))\n\n# (levels=2) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same region\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=2))\n\n# (levels=3) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=3))\n```\n\n## Specific Implementation in `RANKING` Function\n\nThe `RANKING` function [a172ab8] specifically defines the `levels` parameter as:\n\n> `levels` (optional): optional argument (default `None`) for the same `levels` argument as all other window functions.\n\nAnother example from the documentation shows practical usage:\n\n```py\n# Rank customers per-nation by their account balance\n# (highest = rank #1, no ties)\nNations.customers.CALCULATE(r = RANKING(by=acctbal.DESC(), levels=1))\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using window functions with the `levels` parameter:\n\n1. PyDough determines the current collection context\n2. The `levels` parameter tells PyDough how many levels up in the hierarchy to go to define the partitioning\n3. The window function is then applied within each partition defined by that ancestor level\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThe documentation demonstrates that:\n\n1. When omitting the `levels` parameter, the window function applies globally to all records\n2. Using `levels=1` partitions by the immediate parent collection\n3. Using higher values for `levels` partitions by ancestors further up the hierarchy\n4. The parameter should be a value that can be used as an argument to `BACK`\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `levels` parameter in PyDough window functions like `RANKING` determines the hierarchical scope or partitioning for the window function. It specifies which ancestor level should be used to group records when applying the window function, allowing for operations like \"rank customers within each nation\" versus \"rank all customers globally.\""}]}]}

This means each parent record should have at most one corresponding record in the sub-collection.\n\nThe issue arises when:\n1. A sub-collection is naturally plural (many records per parent)\n2. But after applying filters, you expect only one record per parent\n3. PyDough still treats this filtered collection as plural by default\n\nAs stated in [edc4690]:\n> \"Certain PyDough operations, such as specific filters, can cause plural data to become singular. In this case, PyDough will still ban the plural data from being treated as singular unless the `.SINGULAR()` modifier is used to tell PyDough that the data should be treated as singular.\"\n\n## How `SINGULAR()` Works\n\nThe `.SINGULAR()` modifier explicitly tells PyDough that a filtered collection should be treated as having at most one record per parent. This allows you to access scalar properties directly from the filtered collection.\n\nFrom [eb3ac75]:\n> \"To fix this, we can use the `.SINGULAR()` modifier to tell PyDough that the data should be treated as singular.\"\n\n## Example Scenarios\n\n### Example 1: Accessing the Most Recent Package\n\nFrom [edc4690]:\n```py\n%%pydough\n\nmost_recent_package = packages.WHERE(\n    RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1) == 1\n).SINGULAR()\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    first_name,\n    middle_name,\n    last_name,\n    most_recent_package_cost=most_recent_package.package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. `packages` is naturally plural (many packages per person)\n2. The `WHERE` filter with `RANKING` ensures only one package per person (the most recent)\n3. `.SINGULAR()` tells PyDough it's safe to treat this as a singular relationship\n4. This allows direct access to `package_cost` as a scalar property\n\n### Example 2: Filtering for a Specific Person\n\nFrom [edc4690]:\n```py\n%%pydough\n\njs = current_occupants.WHERE(\n    (first_name == \"John\") &\n    (last_name == \"Smith\") &\n    ABSENT(middle_name)\n).SINGULAR()\n\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    address_id,\n    john_smith_email=DEFAULT_TO(js.email, \"NO JOHN SMITH LIVING HERE\")\n)\n```\n\nHere, the filter is expected to return at most one \"John Smith\" per address, making `.SINGULAR()` appropriate.\n\n### Example 3: Filtering by Key\n\nFrom [eb3ac75]:\n```py\n%%pydough\nnation_4 = nations.WHERE(key == 4).SINGULAR()\npydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_4_name=nation_4.name))\n```\n\nThis example filters for a specific nation with key=4, which should return at most one record per region.\n\n## Best Practices and Warnings\n\nThe documentation [edc4690] emphasizes an important warning:\n> \"It is very important that this only be used if the user is certain that the data will be singular, since otherwise it can result in undefined behavior when the PyDough code is executed.\"\n\nFrom [eb3ac75]:\n> \"In summary, certain PyDough operations, such as specific filters, can cause plural data to become singular. In this case, PyDough will still ban the plural data from being treated as singular unless the `.SINGULAR()` modifier is used to tell PyDough that the data should be treated as singular. It is very important that this only be used if the user is certain that the data will be singular, since otherwise it can result in undefined behavior when the PyDough code is executed.\"\n\n## Bad Example\n\nThe documentation [edc4690] also provides a bad example to illustrate incorrect usage:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    package_id=current_occupants.WHERE(\n        first_name == \"John\"\n    ).SINGULAR().packages.package_id\n)\n```\n\nThis is problematic because:\n1. Each address might have multiple occupants named \"John\"\n2. Even if `.SINGULAR()` were valid, `packages` is a plural sub-collection of `current_occupants`\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `SINGULAR()` function addresses the issue of accessing scalar properties from filtered sub-collections that are expected to be unique per parent record after filtering. It explicitly tells PyDough that a naturally plural relationship has become singular through filtering operations, allowing direct access to scalar properties of the filtered sub-collection."}]}]}

It's one of several string manipulation functions available in the PyDough library, alongside other functions like:\n- `LOWER` - converts characters to lowercase\n- `UPPER` - converts characters to uppercase\n- `STARTSWITH` - checks if a string begins with a specific prefix\n- `ENDSWITH` - checks if a string ends with a specific suffix\n- `CONTAINS` - checks if a string contains a specific substring\n- `LIKE` - checks if a string matches an SQL pattern\n- `JOIN_STRINGS` - concatenates strings with a delimiter\n\n## Usage Pattern\n\nThe `LENGTH` function is typically used within a `CALCULATE` operation to create a new property that represents the character count of an existing string property. As shown in the example [8431c97]:\n\n```python\nSuppliers.CALCULATE(n_chars_in_comment = LENGTH(comment))\n```\n\nThis creates a new property called `n_chars_in_comment` that contains the number of characters in the `comment` property for each record in the `Suppliers` collection.\n\n## PyDough Conventions\n\nThe function follows PyDough's naming conventions for built-in functions, using all uppercase letters. This is consistent with other string functions in PyDough like `LOWER`, `UPPER`, etc. [8431c97]\n\nIt's worth noting that PyDough does not support Python's built-in `len()` function for string length calculation. As mentioned in the documentation [c475f31]:\n\n```\nThe `len` function calls the `__len__` magic method, which is not supported in PyDough. This operation is not allowed because the implementation has to return an integer instead of a PyDough object. Instead, usage of [LENGTH](#length) function is recommended.\n```\n\n## Data Flow\n\nWhen using the `LENGTH` function:\n1. The function takes a string expression as input\n2. It calculates the number of characters in that string\n3. It returns a numeric value representing the character count\n4. This value can then be used in further calculations or as a property in the result set\n\nThis follows PyDough's general pattern of transforming data through expressions that can be composed into more complex operations.\n\nThe `LENGTH` function is a simple but essential utility for string manipulation in PyDough, allowing users to determine the size of string values in their data collections."}]}]}

This allows calculating what portion each customer represents of the total customer base.\n\n2. **Per-Nation Customer Ratio**:\n   When used with `levels=1` in the context of `Nations.customers`, `RELSIZE(levels=1)` returns the count of customers within each specific nation. This allows calculating what portion each customer represents within their nation.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow when using `RELSIZE` for customer ratios works as follows:\n\n1. The function counts the relevant number of records (either globally or per ancestor)\n2. This count is used as a denominator in a division operation\n3. The result is a ratio that represents the relationship between an individual value and the total count\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe examples demonstrate several PyDough best practices:\n\n1. **Contextual Calculation**: Using `CALCULATE` to define new derived properties\n2. **Hierarchical Data Navigation**: Leveraging the document model to navigate from nations to their customers\n3. **Window Function Usage**: Using `RELSIZE` with appropriate `levels` parameter to get the right scope of calculation\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe examples follow PyDough conventions by:\n\n1. Using the document model to express hierarchical relationships (nations containing customers) [988171e]\n2. Using `CALCULATE` to define new derived properties\n3. Using window functions with appropriate parameters to achieve the desired calculation scope\n\n## Addressing the Original Question\n\nThe examples directly address the original question by showing:\n\n1. How to calculate a ratio using the global customer count: `acctbal / RELSIZE()`\n2. How to calculate a ratio using per-nation customer count: `acctbal / RELSIZE(levels=1)`\n\nThese patterns can be extended to other similar ratio calculations involving customers globally or per nation."}]}]}

This is particularly useful when working with to-many relationships where you need to verify that there is at least one related record before performing operations.\n\n### Function Definition and Usage\n\nFrom the search results, we can see examples of the `HAS()` function being used in WHERE clauses to filter collections based on whether a related subcollection has any records:\n\nFrom [da99528]:\n```python\nPeople.WHERE(\n  current_address.city == \"San Francisco\"\n).TOP_K(100)\n```\n\nFrom [c77b4ad]:\n```python\nselected_customers = Customers.WHERE((nation_key == 4) & HAS(lq))\n```\n\nFrom [aed8f9e]:\n```python\nAddresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants)).CALCULATE(\n  city,\n  state,\n  n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants),\n)\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using the `HAS()` function:\n\n1. The function takes a subcollection as its argument\n2. It evaluates to `True` if the subcollection contains at least one record\n3. It evaluates to `False` if the subcollection is empty\n4. It's typically used in WHERE clauses to filter parent collections based on the existence of related records\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe examples show that `HAS()` is used in conjunction with other PyDough patterns:\n\n1. It's used within WHERE clauses to filter collections\n2. It can be combined with other conditions using logical operators like `&` (AND)\n3. It's used before performing operations like COUNT() on subcollections to ensure there are records to count\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe `HAS()` function follows PyDough's convention of providing intuitive, readable functions that express common data operations. It's designed to work with PyDough's hierarchical data model where collections can have subcollections representing to-many relationships.\n\n## Examples from the Search Results\n\n### Example 1: Filtering addresses with occupants\n\nFrom [aed8f9e]:\n```python\nAddresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants)).CALCULATE(\n  city,\n  state,\n  n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants),\n)\n```\n\nThis example filters the Addresses collection to only include addresses that have at least one current occupant, then calculates the city, state, and number of occupants for each of those addresses.\n\n### Example 2: Filtering customers with specific orders\n\nFrom [c77b4ad]:\n```python\nselected_customers = Customers.WHERE((nation_key == 4) & HAS(lq))\n```\n\nThis example filters the Customers collection to only include customers from nation #4 who have at least one record in the 'lq' subcollection.\n\nThe `HAS()` function is the appropriate answer to the original question as it's specifically designed to check if a collection representing a to-many relationship has at least one related record."}]}]}

It counts either all non-null rows globally, or the number of non-null rows per an ancestor of a sub-collection.\n\n## Function Syntax and Parameters\n\nThe function takes the following parameters:\n\n```\nRELCOUNT(expression, levels=None)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `expression`: the singular expression to count the number of non-null entries across multiple rows.\n- `levels` (optional): optional argument (default `None`) for the same `levels` argument as all other window functions.\n\n## Examples\n\nFrom [0a7d61d], here are the provided examples:\n\n```python\n# Divides each customer's account balance by the total number of positive\n# account balances globally.\nCustomers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELCOUNT(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0.0)))\n\n# Divides each customer's account balance by the total number of positive\n# account balances in the same nation.\nNations.customers.CALCULATE(ratio = acctbal / RELCOUNT(KEEP_IF(acctbal, acctbal > 0.0), levels=1))\n```\n\n## Related Functions\n\nThe documentation also mentions a related function called `RELSIZE` [0a7d61d], which returns the number of total records, either globally or the number of sub-collection rows per some ancestor collection.\n\n## How RELCOUNT Works in PyDough's Data Model\n\nPyDough allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking [988171e], which is closer to human linguistics than a relational model. The `RELCOUNT` function operates within this hierarchical model to count non-null values across records.\n\nIn PyDough's execution model, it translates its logic into SQL which it can directly execute in a database [988171e]. The `RELCOUNT` function would be translated into appropriate SQL counting operations.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen using `RELCOUNT`, it's important to understand the hierarchical relationship between collections. The `levels` parameter allows you to specify at which ancestor level you want to perform the counting, which is particularly useful when working with nested data structures.\n\nThe examples demonstrate a common pattern of using `RELCOUNT` with `KEEP_IF` to count only records that meet certain conditions (in this case, positive account balances)."}]}]}

This function allows you to identify a specific record from a sub-collection that is optimal with regards to some metric, per-record of the current collection.\n\n### BEST Function\n\nAs described in [aed8f9e]:\n\n> PyDough supports identifying a specific record from a sub-collection that is optimal with regards to some metric, per-record of the current collection. This is done by using `BEST` instead of directly accessing the sub-collection. The first argument to `BEST` is the sub-collection to be accessed, and the second is a `by` argument used to find the optimal record of the sub-collection.\n\nThe syntax for `BEST` is:\n```python\nBEST(sub_collection, by=collation_term)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `sub_collection` is the collection to search within\n- `by` is the metric used to determine the \"best\" record (can be a single collation term or an iterable of terms)\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe process of finding top-ranked items within nested groups typically involves:\n\n1. **Partitioning data**: Using the `PARTITION` function [2ba30a5] to group data by specific criteria\n2. **Finding the best item**: Using the `BEST` function to identify the top item in each group\n3. **Calculating relevant metrics**: Using `CALCULATE` to compute necessary values\n\n## Examples of Finding Top-Ranked Items Within Groups\n\n### Example 1: Finding the Top Order per Priority\n\nFrom [0fdb493], here's an example that finds the highest total price order for each priority type:\n\n```python\n# Find information about the highest total price order for each priority\n# type in 1992. Specifically, for each order priority, the key & total\n# price of the order. Order the results by priority.\npriorities = PARTITION(\n    # Additional code not shown in the search results\n)\n```\n\n### Example 2: Finding Top Products per Category per Region\n\nBased on the examples in [aed8f9e], we can infer how to find top products per category per region:\n\n```python\n# For each region, find the top product in each category\nregions.CALCULATE(\n    name,\n    top_products = BEST(categories, by=name.ASC()).CALCULATE(\n        category_name,\n        best_product = BEST(products, by=sales.DESC()).CALCULATE(\n            product_name,\n            sales\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Example 3: Finding the Best Package per Customer\n\nFrom [aed8f9e], here's an example of finding the first-ever purchase for each customer:\n\n```python\nCustomers.BEST(packages, by=order_date.ASC()).CALCULATE(\n    package_id,\n    shipping_address.zip_code\n)\n```\n\n### Example 4: Finding the Most Recent Package per Customer\n\nAlso from [aed8f9e]:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    most_recent_cost=BEST(packages, by=order_date.DESC()).package_cost\n)\n```\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\n1. **Using PARTITION for grouping**: The examples show how to use `PARTITION` to create groups based on specific criteria [2ba30a5]\n\n2. **Using BEST for ranking**: The examples demonstrate how to use `BEST` to find the top item in each group [aed8f9e]\n\n3. **Combining with CALCULATE**: The examples show how to use `CALCULATE` to compute relevant metrics for the top-ranked items [aed8f9e]\n\n4. **Breaking ties**: The examples show how to break ties by providing multiple collation terms to the `by` parameter [aed8f9e]\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about finding items that rank highest within multiple nested groups. The PyDough approach uses:\n\n1. `PARTITION` to create the nested groups\n2. `BEST` to find the highest-ranking item in each group\n3. Nested operations to handle multiple levels of grouping\n\nThis approach allows for finding, for example, the top product per category per region, by first partitioning by region, then finding the best product within each category within each region.\n\n## Additional Options for BEST Function\n\nThe `BEST` function also supports additional parameters [aed8f9e]:\n\n- `allow_ties` (default=False): if True, keeps all records that share the optimal values\n- `n_best` (default=1): if greater than 1, keeps the top n_best values of the sub-collection\n\nThese parameters provide flexibility when finding top-ranked items within groups."}]}]}

As shown in [e67e9de], you can use this function to calculate averages:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.package_cost),\n)\n```\n\n### Down-Streaming Pattern\nThe key pattern that enables comparing individual records to collection-wide averages is PyDough's \"down-streaming\" capability [e67e9de]. This allows values calculated at a parent collection level to be accessible to all descendants of that context using the same name.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe typical pattern for comparing a record's value against a collection average involves:\n\n1. First calculating the average at the collection level using `CALCULATE` with the `AVG()` function\n2. Then accessing that average value in a nested calculation for individual records\n3. Using comparison operators to compare individual values against the average\n\nAs demonstrated in [e67e9de], this pattern looks like:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n  is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- First, the average package cost is calculated across all packages for each customer\n- Then, for each individual package, a boolean flag `is_above_avg` is created by comparing that package's cost to the average\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe documentation shows several best practices:\n\n1. **Meaningful naming**: Using descriptive names like `avg_package_cost` and `is_above_avg` [e67e9de]\n2. **Hierarchical thinking**: Leveraging the hierarchical relationship between collections (Customers \u2192 packages) [988171e]\n3. **Avoiding redundancy**: Calculating the average once at the parent level rather than repeatedly [e67e9de]\n\n## PyDough Conventions\n\nThis pattern follows PyDough conventions by:\n\n1. Using `CALCULATE` to define new terms [e67e9de]\n2. Properly leveraging the down-streaming capability to make parent calculations available to child contexts [e67e9de]\n3. Using aggregation functions on plural data (collections) [e67e9de]\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asks about comparing a record's value against the overall average across all records in a collection. The pattern shown in [e67e9de] directly addresses this by:\n\n1. Calculating the average at the collection level\n2. Making that average available to individual records through down-streaming\n3. Allowing direct comparison between individual values and the collection average\n\n## Example from Documentation\n\nA complete example from [e67e9de] demonstrates this pattern:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n  is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis example shows how to:\n1. Calculate the average cost of all packages for each customer\n2. For each package, determine if its cost is above the average for that customer\n3. Store this comparison as a boolean value `is_above_avg`\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this example is marked as a \"Bad Example #5\" in [e67e9de] because it demonstrates an incorrect implementation. The correct implementation would need to ensure that the calculation with the average is properly accessible to the descendants where the comparison is made.\n\nA correct implementation would ensure that the collection where the comparison is made has the collection with the average calculation as an ancestor, as shown in the \"Good Example #3\" from [79d3c82]:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n  avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n  is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis pattern allows you to effectively compare individual record values against collection-wide averages in PyDough."}]}]}

However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`. As a result, it is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used.\n```\n\n## Scope Difference Explanation\n\n1. `CALCULATE(avg_val=AVG(subcollection.value))`:\n   - This calculation computes the average of `value` across all records in the `subcollection` relative to the current context.\n   - The aggregation function AVG converts the plural `subcollection.value` into a singular value for the parent collection.\n   - The result `avg_val` becomes available in the current context and is down-streamed to descendants.\n\n2. `CALCULATE(rel_avg=RELAVG(value, per='parent'))` when applied to the `subcollection`:\n   - While not explicitly documented in the search results, this appears to calculate a relative average where each `value` in the subcollection is compared to the parent's average.\n   - The `per='parent'` parameter suggests the calculation is performed relative to the parent collection.\n   - This would be calculated within the context of each subcollection record.\n\n## Example from Search Results\n\n[79d3c82] provides a relevant example that demonstrates a similar scope difference:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis example:\n1. First calculates the average package cost for each customer\n2. Then determines for each package whether its cost is above the customer's average\n3. Demonstrates how a value calculated at the parent level (`avg_package_cost`) is available to the child collection through down-streaming\n\n## Best Practices\n\n[e67e9de] mentions an important best practice:\n\n```\nAs a result, it is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used.\n```\n\nThis helps avoid ambiguity when referencing properties across different collection levels.\n\nIn conclusion, the key difference between the two approaches is the context in which the calculation is performed and how the result is scoped - either at the parent collection level (using AVG) or at the individual subcollection record level (using RELAVG with per='parent')."}]}]}

If it is provided, it should be a value that can be used as an argument to `BACK`, and in that case it means that the set of values used by the window function should be per-record of the correspond ancestor.\n\nExamples of using `levels` [60f366b]:\n```py\n# (no levels) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(...))\n\n# (levels=1) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same nation\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=1))\n\n# (levels=2) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same region\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=2))\n\n# (levels=3) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=3))\n```\n\n### `allow_ties` Parameter\nThe `allow_ties` parameter controls whether tied values receive the same rank. From [a172ab8]:\n\n> `allow_ties` (optional): optional argument (default False) specifying to allow values that are tied according to the `by` expressions to have the same rank value. If False, tied values have different rank values where ties are broken arbitrarily.\n\n### `dense` Parameter\nThe `dense` parameter affects how ranks are assigned after ties. From [a172ab8]:\n\n> `dense` (optional): optional argument (default False) specifying that if `allow_ties` is True and a tie is found, should the next value after the ties be the current ranking value plus 1, as opposed to jumping to a higher value based on the number of ties that were there. For example, with the values `[a, a, b, b, b, c]`, the values with `dense=True` would be `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, but with `dense=False` they would be `[1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nThe documentation provides these examples of using the `RANKING` function [a172ab8]:\n\n```py\n# Rank customers per-nation by their account balance\n# (highest = rank #1, no ties)\nNations.customers.CALCULATE(r = RANKING(by=acctbal.DESC(), levels=1))\n\n# For every customer, finds their most recent order\n# (ties allowed)\nCustomers.orders.WHERE(RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1, allow_ties=True) == 1)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how to use the `RANKING` function to rank records based on specific criteria and how to filter results based on those rankings.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `RANKING` window function in PyDough allows you to assign ordinal positions to records based on specified ordering criteria. It provides flexibility through its parameters to control the scope of ranking (`levels`), handling of tied values (`allow_ties`), and the density of rank values after ties (`dense`)."}]}]}

This is similar to the `.join()` method in Python.\n\nThe official definition from the PyDough documentation states:\n\n> The `JOIN_STRINGS` function concatenates all its string arguments, using the first argument as a delimiter between each of the following arguments (like the `.join` method in Python) [8431c97]\n\n## Syntax and Usage\n\nThe function syntax is:\n```\nJOIN_STRINGS(delim, s1, s2, ...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `delim` is the delimiter string to be placed between each of the subsequent arguments\n- `s1, s2, ...` are the string arguments to be concatenated\n\n## Example\n\nThe documentation provides a clear example of how to use this function [8431c97]:\n\n```py\nRegions.CALCULATE(\n    region_name=name\n).nations.CALCULATE(\n    nation_name=name\n).customers.CALCULATE(\n    fully_qualified_name = JOIN_STRINGS(\"-\", region_name, nation_name, name)\n)\n```\n\nThe documentation also provides a simple example of the expected output [8431c97]:\n```\nFor instance, `JOIN_STRINGS(\"; \", \"Alpha\", \"Beta\", \"Gamma)` returns `\"Alpha; Beta; Gamma\"`\n```\n\n## Context in PyDough\n\nThe `JOIN_STRINGS` function is categorized under \"String Functions\" in the PyDough documentation [8431c97], alongside other string manipulation functions like:\n- `LOWER`\n- `UPPER`\n- `LENGTH`\n- `STARTSWITH`\n- `ENDSWITH`\n- `CONTAINS`\n- `LIKE`\n\nThis function is part of PyDough's built-in functions that help with data transformation and manipulation, particularly for string operations when working with hierarchical data models.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen using `JOIN_STRINGS`, it's important to remember that:\n1. The first argument is always the delimiter\n2. All arguments should be string expressions or values that can be converted to strings\n3. The function follows the same pattern as other PyDough string functions, using all-caps naming convention\n\nThis function is particularly useful when you need to create composite identifiers or formatted strings from multiple fields in your data model."}]}]}

Records where the condition is True are preserved, while others are dropped.\n\n### PARTITION Operation [7b73db5]\nThe `PARTITION` operation creates a new collection by partitioning records based on partitioning terms:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\n- `data`: The PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name`: String indicating the name used when accessing partitioned data\n- `by`: Single partitioning key or iterable of keys\n\n## Conceptual Difference\n\nThe key conceptual difference between filtering before versus after partitioning is:\n\n1. **Filtering BEFORE partitioning** [7b73db5]:\n   - Filters individual records from the original collection\n   - Only records that pass the filter are included in the partitioning\n   - Affects which groups are created and their contents\n   - Some partition groups might not be created at all if all their potential members are filtered out\n\n2. **Filtering AFTER partitioning** [7b73db5]:\n   - Operates on the already-formed partition groups\n   - Filters entire partition groups based on aggregate properties\n   - Can use aggregated values from the partition in the filter condition\n   - Allows filtering based on group-level statistics\n\n## Example from Documentation\n\nA clear example demonstrating this difference is shown in [7b73db5]:\n\n```python\npackage_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_year=YEAR(order_date), order_month=MONTH(order_date))\n\nPARTITION(package_info, name=\"packs\", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packs.package_cost)\n).packs.WHERE(\n    package_cost < avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. First, package information is prepared with year and month calculations\n2. Then data is partitioned by year and month\n3. For each partition, the average package cost is calculated\n4. Finally, a filter is applied AFTER partitioning to include only packages that cost less than the average for their specific year/month group\n\nThis demonstrates filtering after partitioning, which allows comparing individual records against aggregate statistics of their group.\n\n## Another Relevant Example [3f7d77d]\n\n```python\nselected_parts = parts.WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, \"BRASS\") & (size == 15))\npart_types = PARTITION(selected_parts, name=\"p\", by=part_type).CALCULATE(avg_price=AVG(p.retail_price))\noutput = part_types.p.WHERE(retail_price < avg_price)\n```\n\nThis example shows:\n1. First filtering BEFORE partitioning to select only brass parts of size 15\n2. Then partitioning by part_type\n3. Calculating average price for each partition\n4. Finally filtering AFTER partitioning to select only parts with price below their group's average\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe documentation shows that:\n1. Filtering before partitioning is useful for narrowing down the dataset to relevant records\n2. Filtering after partitioning is powerful for comparing individual values against group aggregates\n3. The `name` parameter in `PARTITION` is important for accessing the original records within each partition\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe examples clearly demonstrate that:\n- Filtering before `PARTITION` operates on individual records and determines which records participate in the partitioning process\n- Filtering after `PARTITION` operates on partition groups and can leverage aggregate statistics calculated for each group\n\nThis distinction is crucial for understanding data flow in PyDough and for designing efficient analytical queries that need to compare individual values against group statistics."}]}]}

[8431c97]\n\n### Syntax and Parameters\n\nThe function takes two arguments:\n1. The string to check\n2.

The RANKING function is ordering all orders for each customer by the order date in descending order (most recent first)\n2. With `allow_ties=True`, if multiple orders have exactly the same date (tied for most recent), they will all receive the same rank value of 1\n3. The WHERE clause then filters to keep only orders with rank 1, which means all orders tied for the most recent date will be included\n\nWithout `allow_ties=True` (the default behavior), tied values would have different rank values where ties are broken arbitrarily. This means if a customer had multiple orders on the same most recent date, only one of them would be selected arbitrarily.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in this example:\n1. Start with the Customers collection\n2. Navigate to their orders subcollection\n3. For each customer, rank their orders by date (descending)\n4. Filter to keep only orders with rank 1 (the most recent, including ties)\n\n## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThis example demonstrates:\n1. Using window functions (RANKING) to solve ordering problems\n2. Proper parameter usage to handle edge cases (ties in dates)\n3. Using the WHERE clause with a window function to filter results\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about the purpose of `allow_ties=True` in finding a customer's most recent order. The parameter ensures that if a customer placed multiple orders on the same date (which happens to be their most recent order date), all of those orders would be included in the results rather than arbitrarily selecting just one of them."}]}]}
{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "You are an analytics expert and a proficient Pydough generator that creates Python code based on natural language descriptions."}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What makes referencing `People.email` invalid in `PARTITION` Bad Example #4 after partitioning by `birth_year`?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "# Explanation of Invalid `People.email` Reference in PARTITION Bad Example #7\n\nThe question asks about why referencing `People.email` is invalid in a PARTITION Bad Example after partitioning by `birth_year`. Looking at the search results, I can provide a detailed explanation based on the PyDough documentation.\n\n## The Invalid Example\n\nThe specific bad example in question is found in [7330190]:\n\n**Bad Example #7**: Partition people by their birth year to find the number of people born in each year. Invalid because the `email` property is referenced, which is not one of the partition keys, even though the data being partitioned does have an `email` property.\n\n```py\n%%pydough\nPARTITION(People.CALCULATE(birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)), name=\"ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    email,\n    n_people=COUNT(ppl)\n)\n```\n\n## Why This Is Invalid\n\nAccording to the PyDough documentation [7330190], when using the `PARTITION` operation, you can only reference properties that are part of the partition keys in the resulting collection. In this example:\n\n1. The data is partitioned by `birth_year` only\n2. The code then tries to reference `email` in the CALCULATE clause\n3. Since `email` is not one of the partition keys, this reference is invalid\n\n## How PARTITION Works in PyDough\n\nFrom [7b73db5] and [7330190], we can understand that:\n\n1. The `PARTITION` operation creates a new collection by partitioning records based on specified partitioning terms\n2. Every unique combination of values of those partitioning terms corresponds to a single record in the new collection\n3. The terms of the new collection are limited to:\n   - The partitioning terms themselves (in this case, only `birth_year`)\n   - A single sub-collection mapping back to the bucketed terms of the original data (in this case, `ppl`)\n\n## Best Practices for PARTITION\n\nThe documentation shows several good examples of proper PARTITION usage:\n\nFrom [7b73db5], a valid example is:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\nPARTITION(yahoo_people, name=\"yah_ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    n_people=COUNT(yah_ppl)\n)\n```\n\nThis works because it only references:\n1. The partition key (`birth_year`)\n2. An aggregation of the partitioned data (`COUNT(yah_ppl)`)\n\n## How to Fix the Invalid Example\n\nTo fix the invalid example, you would need to either:\n\n1. Include `email` as one of the partition keys:\n```py\nPARTITION(People.CALCULATE(birth_year=YEAR(birth_date), email), name=\"ppl\", by=(birth_year, email))\n```\n\n2. Or access `email` through the partitioned collection:\n```py\nPARTITION(People.CALCULATE(birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)), name=\"ppl\", by=birth_year).ppl.CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    email,\n    n_people=COUNT(ppl)\n)\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThe reference to `People.email` is invalid in the PARTITION Bad Example #7 because when using PARTITION, you can only reference properties that are part of the partition keys in the resulting collection's CALCULATE clause. Since `email` was not included in the partition keys (only `birth_year` was), it cannot be directly referenced in the CALCULATE clause after partitioning."}]}]}
{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "You are an analytics expert and a proficient Pydough generator that creates Python code based on natural language descriptions."}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What purpose does down-streaming serve in complex PyDough queries involving partitioning and sub-collections?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "# Explanation of Down-streaming in PyDough\n\n## What is Down-streaming in PyDough?\n\nDown-streaming in PyDough is a mechanism that allows expressions defined in a parent collection's `CALCULATE` call to be available to all descendant collections. This feature is particularly important when working with complex queries involving partitioning and sub-collections.\n\nAccording to the PyDough DSL specification [0e3bd07], down-streaming is defined as:\n\n> \"Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`. As a result, it is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used.\"\n\n## Purpose of Down-streaming in Complex Queries\n\nDown-streaming serves several important purposes in complex PyDough queries:\n\n1. **Data Sharing Across Collection Levels**: It allows calculations made at a higher level to be accessible at lower levels without recalculation [0e3bd07].\n\n2. **Avoiding Redundant Calculations**: By defining expressions once and reusing them in descendant collections, down-streaming helps avoid redundant calculations and makes code more efficient.\n\n3. **Maintaining Context**: It helps maintain context as you navigate through sub-collections, ensuring that relevant information from parent collections remains accessible.\n\n## Examples of Down-streaming in Action\n\n### Example 1: Accessing Parent Collection Properties\n\n```python\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    current_city=city, current_state=state\n).current_occupants.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    current_city,\n    current_state=current_state,\n)\n```\n\nIn this example from [0e3bd07], the `current_city` and `current_state` expressions defined in the `Addresses` collection are made available to the `current_occupants` sub-collection through down-streaming.\n\n### Example 2: Using Parent Calculations in Complex Conditions\n\n```python\npackage_info = Addresses.CALCULATE(\n    first_address_id=address_id\n).current_occupants.packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_shipped_to_current_addr=shipping_address.address_id == first_address_id\n)\n```\n\nThis example [0e3bd07] shows how `first_address_id` defined in the `Addresses` collection is down-streamed to be used in a comparison within the `packages` sub-collection.\n\n### Example 3: Down-streaming in What-If Analysis\n\nFrom the \"What-If\" analysis notebook [8e03891], we can see down-streaming in action with revenue calculations:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\n\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\nHere, `revenue_def` is defined as a contextless expression and then used in multiple levels of the query. The `total_line_price` calculated at the orders level is down-streamed to be used in the `lines` sub-collection.\n\n## Best Practices for Down-streaming\n\n1. **Avoid Name Conflicts**: As stated in the documentation [0e3bd07], it's best practice to \"avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used\" to prevent ambiguity.\n\n2. **No-op Assignments Are Allowed**: The documentation notes that \"it is ok to create a term with a name conflict so long as it is a no-op assignment.\" For example: `collection.CALCULATE(x=a+b, y=a-b).subcollection.CALCULATE(x, y=y)` [0e3bd07].\n\n3. **Only Calculated Terms Are Down-streamed**: \"Only names that have been placed in a `CALCULATE` are available to descendant terms; any other properties of the current context are not made available to its descendants\" [0e3bd07].\n\n## How Down-streaming Relates to Partitioning and Sub-collections\n\nWhen working with partitioning (using the `PARTITION` operator) and sub-collections, down-streaming becomes especially valuable because:\n\n1. It allows aggregated values from a parent collection to be compared with individual values in sub-collections.\n\n2. It enables complex calculations that span multiple levels of the data hierarchy.\n\n3. It facilitates the creation of ratios, comparisons, and other derived metrics that require data from different collection levels.\n\nIn summary, down-streaming is a powerful feature in PyDough that enables more intuitive and efficient data analysis across collection hierarchies, making it particularly valuable for complex queries involving partitioning and sub-collections."}]}]}

According to the documentation, the following functions are available:\n\n1. **YEAR** - Extracts the year component [7a617df]\n2. **MONTH** - Extracts the month component [7a617df]\n3. **DAY** - Extracts the day component [7a617df]\n4. **HOUR** - Extracts the hour component [7a617df]\n5. **MINUTE** - Extracts the minute component [7a617df]\n6. **SECOND** - Extracts the second component [7a617df]\n\nAdditionally, there are related datetime functions that work with these components:\n- **DAYOFWEEK** - Returns the day of the week (1-7 or 0-6) [7a617df]\n- **DAYNAME** - Returns the name of the day of the week [7a617df]\n\n## Input Format Support\n\nAll these functions accept various datetime input formats [7a617df]:\n\n1. A string literal representing datetime data (e.g., \"2024-01-01\" or \"1999-12-31 12:59:30\")\n2. A datetime literal (e.g., `datetime.date`, `datetime.datetime`, or a `pd.Timestamp` from pandas)\n3. A column of datetime data\n4. Special string literals like \"now\", \"current_date\", \"current_timestamp\" (case-insensitive)\n\nAs noted in the documentation:\n\n> Other datetime functions ([DATEDIFF](#datediff), [YEAR](#year), [MONTH](#month), [DAY](#day), [HOUR](#hour), [MINUTE](#minute) or [SECOND](#second)) also allow any of the base arguments above as datetime values. For example, you can call `YEAR(\"now\")`, `DATEDIFF(\"months\", dt, pd.Timestamp(\"2024-03-14\")))`, `MONTH(\"1999-06-13\")`, or `DATEDIFF(\"days\", datetime.date(2025, 1, 1), \"now\")`.\n\n## Configuration Settings\n\nThe behavior of some datetime functions like DAYOFWEEK can be configured through PyDough configuration settings [b0afa4b]:\n\n```python\nstart_of_week = ConfigProperty[DayOfWeek](DayOfWeek.SUNDAY)\n\"\"\"\nThe day of the week that is considered the start of the week. The default\nis Sunday.\n\"\"\"\n\nstart_week_as_zero = ConfigProperty[bool](True)\n\"\"\"\nIf True, then the week starts at zero. If False, then the week starts at one.\nThe default is True.\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\nWhile specific examples for each extraction function aren't provided in the search results, the documentation indicates they would be used in a similar pattern to other datetime functions. Based on the DAYOFWEEK example [7a617df]:\n\n```python\n# Returns the day of the week for the order date\nOrders.CALCULATE(day_of_week = DAYOFWEEK(order_date))\n```\n\nSimilarly, you would use the component extraction functions:\n\n```python\n# Example usage pattern (inferred from documentation)\nOrders.CALCULATE(\n    order_year = YEAR(order_date),\n    order_month = MONTH(order_date),\n    order_day = DAY(order_date)\n)\n```\n\n## PyDough Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThe datetime extraction functions follow PyDough's general design principles:\n1. They accept flexible input formats (strings, Python datetime objects, columns)\n2. They have clear, intuitive names that match their functionality\n3.

However, I can provide some context about the `DATETIME` function and related configurations from the available information.\n\n### PyDough DATETIME Function\n\nThe `DATETIME` function in PyDough appears to be a date/time manipulation function that can accept modifiers to transform date values. From the search results, we can see that:\n\n1. The `DATETIME` function supports at least one modifier called \"start of week\" [96f9c2c]\n2. The behavior of this modifier is affected by the `start_of_week` configuration setting\n\n### Configuration Settings Affecting DATETIME\n\nFrom the search results [96f9c2c], we can see that PyDough has configuration settings that affect date-related functions:\n\n```python\n# Understanding the behavior of DATETIME with `start of week`\n# Set the start of the week to Monday\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.MONDAY\n\n# This would set `dt` to the start of the week for March 20, 2025 (Wednesday)\n# to be March 17, 2025 (recent Monday)\nTPCH.calculate(dt = DATETIME(\"2025-03-20\", \"start of week\")) # dt = 2025-03-17\n\n# start_of_week is set to Thursday,\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.Thursday\n\n# This would set `dt` to the start of the week for March 20, 2025 (Thursday)\n# to be March 20, 2025 (recent Thursday)\nTPCH.calculate(dt = DATETIME(\"2025-03-20\", \"start of week\")) # dt = 2025-03-20\n```\n\nThe `start_of_week` configuration can be set to any value from the `DayOfWeek` enum:\n- `DayOfWeek.SUNDAY` (default)\n- `DayOfWeek.MONDAY`\n- `DayOfWeek.TUESDAY`\n- `DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY`\n- `DayOfWeek.THURSDAY`\n- `DayOfWeek.FRIDAY`\n- `DayOfWeek.SATURDAY`\n\n### Limitations of Available Information\n\nThe search results do not explicitly document:\n1. How multiple modifiers would be applied in a single `DATETIME` function call\n2. The order of operations when multiple modifiers are present\n3. Whether multiple modifiers are even supported in a single call\n\n### Best Practices Based on Available Information\n\nWhile the search results don't directly answer the question about multiple modifiers, we can infer some best practices:\n\n1. PyDough appears to follow a pattern where configuration settings affect the behavior of functions\n2. The examples show single modifier usage with the `DATETIME` function\n3. The documentation shows that PyDough has a consistent approach to date/time manipulation across functions like `DAYOFWEEK`, `DATETIME`, and `DATEDIFF`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided search results do not contain sufficient information to definitively answer how multiple modifiers are applied in a `DATETIME` function call. To get a complete answer, additional documentation specifically addressing multiple modifiers in the `DATETIME` function would be needed."}]}]}

This feature allows values defined in an ancestor collection to be accessible to descendant collections.\n\n## How Down-Streaming Works\n\nAs explained in [e67e9de]:\n\n> Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`.\n\nThis means that when you define a calculation (like an average) at a higher level in the hierarchy, that calculation becomes available to all descendant records, allowing for comparisons between individual values and group aggregates.\n\n## Example Implementation\n\nThe most relevant example from the documentation [e67e9de] demonstrates exactly this pattern:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\n    avg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\n    is_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. At the `Customers` level, an average package cost is calculated across all packages for each customer\n2. This average is then made available to each individual package record\n3. Each package can then compare its own cost against the average cost of all packages for its customer\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in this pattern works as follows:\n1. An aggregation function (like `AVG()`) is applied at an ancestor level to compute a group statistic\n2. This statistic is stored as a named value in the ancestor's `CALCULATE` operation\n3. Through down-streaming, this value becomes available to all descendants\n4. Individual records in descendant collections can access this value and compare it to their own properties\n\n## Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe documentation [e67e9de] highlights an important best practice:\n\n> It is best practice to avoid using names in `CALCULATE` that exist elsewhere in the collections being used.\n\nThis helps avoid ambiguity when down-streaming values from ancestors to descendants.\n\n## How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThis pattern follows PyDough's hierarchical thinking model as described in [988171e]:\n\n> PyDough allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking, as seen in models such as MongoDB, since that mental model is closer to human linguistics than a relational model.\n\nThe down-streaming feature leverages this hierarchical model to make ancestor calculations available to descendants, enabling comparisons that would be complex to express in traditional SQL.\n\n## Contrasting with SQL\n\nTo highlight how much simpler this is in PyDough compared to SQL, the documentation [988171e] provides a general comparison:\n\n```py\n# PyDough example\nresult = People.CALCULATE(\n    name,\n    net_income = SUM(jobs.income_earned) - SUM(schools.tuition_paid)\n)\n```\n\nVersus the equivalent SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    P.name AS name,\n    COALESCE(T1.total_income_earned, 0) - COALESCE(T2.total_tuition_paid, 0) AS net_income\nFROM PEOPLE AS P\nLEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT person_ssn, SUM(income_earned) AS total_income_earned\n    FROM EMPLOYMENT_RECORDS\n    GROUP BY person_ssn\n) AS J\nON P.ssn = J.person_ssn\nLEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT person_ssn, SUM(tuition_paid) AS total_tuition_paid\n    FROM EDUCATION_RECORDS\n) AS S\nON P.ssn = S.person_ssn\n```\n\nWhile this example doesn't specifically show the comparison feature, it illustrates how PyDough simplifies complex hierarchical data operations that would require subqueries and joins in SQL.\n\n## Additional Examples\n\nThe documentation provides other examples of down-streaming that follow similar patterns:\n\nFrom [e67e9de]:\n```python\n# Referencing properties from the CALCULATE an ancestor collection\nAddresses.CALCULATE(zip_code).current_occupants.CALCULATE(email).packages.CALCULATE(\n    email, # <- refers to the `email` from `current_occupants`\n    zip_code, # <- refers to the `zip_code` from `Addresses`\n)\n```\n\nThis shows how values can be passed down through multiple levels of the hierarchy.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe PyDough feature that allows comparing a record's value against the average value within a specific group defined by an ancestor is the down-streaming capability combined with the `CALCULATE` operator. This enables hierarchical data analysis patterns that would be much more complex to express in traditional SQL."}]}]}

The documentation explicitly states:\n\n> PyDough currently only supports using references to scalar expressions from the `data` collection itself as partition keys, not an ancestor term, or a term from a child collection, or the result of a function call.\n\nThis is a critical limitation that directly answers the original question.\n\n### Syntax and Usage\n\nThe syntax for the PARTITION operation is [0e3bd07]:\n\n```python\nPARTITION(data, name=\"...\", by=...)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `data` is the PyDough collection to be partitioned\n- `name` is a string indicating the name used when accessing the partitioned data\n- `by` is either a single partitioning key or an iterable of one or more partitioning keys\n\n### Valid Partition Keys\n\nBased on the documentation, only **scalar expressions from the data collection itself** can be used as partition keys. This means:\n\n1. The field must be a scalar property (not a sub-collection)\n2. The field must come directly from the collection being partitioned\n3. The field cannot be from an ancestor or child collection\n4. The field cannot be the result of a function call\n\n### Examples from Documentation\n\nThe documentation provides several examples that demonstrate proper usage of partition keys [0e3bd07]:\n\n**Good Example #1**: Finding every unique state\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(state)\n```\n\n**Good Example #2**: Counting addresses by state\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=state).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    n_addr=COUNT(addrs)\n)\n```\n\n**Good Example #3**: Counting people by city/state combination\n```python\nPARTITION(Addresses, name=\"addrs\", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(\n    state,\n    city,\n    n_people=COUNT(addrs.current_occupants)\n)\n```\n\n**Good Example #4**: Finding years with most people born with yahoo emails\n```python\nyahoo_people = People.CALCULATE(\n    birth_year=YEAR(birth_date)\n).WHERE(ENDSWITH(email, \"@yahoo.com\"))\n\nPARTITION(yahoo_people, name=\"yah_ppl\", by=birth_year).CALCULATE(\n    birth_year,\n    # Additional calculation code follows\n)\n```\n\nNote that in Example #4, the `birth_year` field is first calculated and added to the collection before being used as a partition key, which follows the rule that partition keys must be scalar expressions from the data collection itself.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nThe documentation implies these best practices:\n1. Use only scalar properties from the collection being partitioned\n2. If you need to partition by a calculated value, first use CALCULATE to add it to the collection\n3. You can use multiple fields for partitioning by providing them as a tuple\n\n### Summary\n\nTo directly answer the original question: Only scalar expressions from the data collection itself can be used as partition keys in Pydough. You cannot use fields from ancestor or child collections, nor can you use the results of function calls directly as partition keys."}]}]}

Based on the provided search results, I'll explain how PyDough handles these relationships and how they can be verified.\n\n## 1. PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns for One-to-Many Relationships\n\nIn PyDough, one-to-many relationships are defined in the metadata representation through subcollection properties. Looking at the search results, we can see examples of how these relationships are structured:\n\nFrom [7fc8fe3], we can see that relationships are defined with properties like:\n```json\n\"shipping_address\": {\n  \"type\": \"simple_join\",\n  \"other_collection_name\": \"Addresses\",\n  \"singular\": true,\n  \"no_collisions\": false,\n  \"keys\": {\n    \"shipping_address_id\": [\"aid\"]\n  },\n  \"reverse_relationship_name\": \"shipped_packages\"\n}\n```\n\nKey components of a relationship definition include:\n- `type`: Typically \"simple_join\" for relationships\n- `other_collection_name`: The collection being joined to\n- `singular`: Boolean indicating if it's a one-to-one (true) or one-to-many (false) relationship\n- `keys`: The mapping between keys in the collections\n- `reverse_relationship_name`: The name of the property in the other collection that refers back to this one\n\n## 2. Data Flow and Transformations in One-to-Many Relationships\n\nAccording to [0e3bd07], when accessing subcollections in PyDough, the data flows as follows:\n\n> Using the syntax `collection.subcollection`, you can traverse into every record of `subcollection` for each record in `collection`. This operation may change the cardinality if records of `collection` have multiple associated records in `subcollection`. Additionally, duplicate records may appear in the output if records in `subcollection` are linked to multiple records in `collection`.\n\nFor example, from [0e3bd07]:\n```python\n%%pydough\nPeople.packages\n```\nThis would retrieve all packages ordered by each person, with every package appearing exactly once since each package has a single customer.\n\n## 3. Important PyDough Best Practices for Relationships\n\nFrom the search results, we can identify these best practices:\n\n1. **Naming conventions**: As shown in [7fc8fe3], relationship names should be descriptive and follow a consistent pattern. For example, `shipping_address` for a forward relationship and `shipped_packages` for the reverse relationship.\n\n2. **Verification through exploration APIs**: PyDough provides exploration APIs to verify and understand relationships, as shown in [eb57e42] and [2e54fa8]:\n   - `pydough.explain_structure(graph)` - Shows the overall structure including relationships\n   - `pydough.explain(collection)` - Shows details about a specific collection\n   - `pydough.explain_term(collection, term)` - Explains a specific relationship\n\n## 4. PyDough Conventions for One-to-Many Relationships\n\nFrom [9c4448e] and other search results, we can see that PyDough follows these conventions for one-to-many relationships:\n\n1. **Cardinality indicators**: In the metadata, `singular: true` indicates a one-to-one relationship, while `singular: false` (or omitted) indicates a one-to-many relationship.\n\n2. **Reverse relationship naming**: Every relationship has a corresponding reverse relationship, named in the `reverse_relationship_name` field.\n\n3. **Relationship visualization**: When using `pydough.explain_structure()`, relationships are displayed with cardinality indicators:\n   - `[one member of collection]` for one-to-one relationships\n   - `[multiple collection]` for one-to-many relationships\n\n## 5. How to Verify One-to-Many Relationships\n\nBased on the search results, to verify a one-to-many relationship between collections:\n\n1. **Use `pydough.explain_structure(graph)`** to see all relationships in the graph with their cardinality indicators [2e54fa8].\n\n2. **Use `pydough.explain(graph[\"collection_name\"])`** to see details about a specific collection, including its subcollection properties [988171e].\n\n3. **Use `pydough.explain(graph[\"collection_name\"][\"property_name\"])`** to examine a specific relationship property [2e54fa8]:\n   ```\n   PyDough property: nations.customers\n   This property connects collection nations to customers.\n   Cardinality of connection: One -> Many\n   Is reversible: yes\n   Reverse property: customers.nation\n   ```\n\n4. **Check the metadata definition** directly to see if `singular` is set to `false` or omitted, indicating a one-to-many relationship [7fc8fe3].\n\n## 6. Examples from the Search Results\n\nFrom [7fc8fe3], we can see a complete example of how collections and their relationships are defined:\n\n```json\n\"billing_address\": {\n  \"type\": \"simple_join\",\n  \"other_collection_name\": \"Addresses\",\n  \"singular\": true,\n  \"no_collisions\": false,\n  \"keys\": {\n    \"billing_address_id\": [\"aid\"]\n  },\n  \"reverse_relationship_name\": \"billed_packages\"\n}\n```\n\nFrom [2e54fa8], we can see how `pydough.explain` displays relationship information:\n```\nPyDough property: nations.customers\nThis property connects collection nations to customers.\nCardinality of connection: One -> Many\nIs reversible: yes\nReverse property: customers.nation\nThe subcollection relationship is defined by the following join conditions:\nnations.key == customers.nation_key\n```\n\nFrom [0e3bd07], we can see examples of accessing one-to-many relationships in code:\n```python\n%%pydough\nPeople.packages\n```\n\nIn conclusion, verifying one-to-many relationships in PyDough involves examining the metadata definition (checking if `singular` is false or omitted) and using the exploration APIs (`explain_structure`, `explain`, and `explain_term`) to understand the cardinality and structure of relationships between collections."}]}]}

This is essential when accessing properties of sub-collections within a collection context.\n\nAs stated in the documentation [edc4690]:\n\n> In PyDough, it is required that if we are accessing a sub-collection in a collection context, the collection must be singular with regards to the sub-collection. Certain PyDough operations, such as specific filters, can cause plural data to become singular. In this case, PyDough will still ban the plural data from being treated as singular unless the `.SINGULAR()` modifier is used to tell PyDough that the data should be treated as singular.\n\n## When to Use SINGULAR\n\nThe `SINGULAR` modifier is specifically needed when:\n\n1. You have a sub-collection that would normally contain multiple records\n2. You've applied operations (like filters) that ensure it will contain at most one record per parent record\n3. You want to access scalar properties of that sub-collection directly\n\nWithout using `SINGULAR()`, PyDough will raise an error because it doesn't know which record's property to use when multiple could exist [eb3ac75].\n\n## Example from Documentation\n\nThe documentation provides a clear example [eb3ac75] of when `SINGULAR` is needed:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\nnation_4 = nations.WHERE(key == 4)\npydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_4_name=nation_4.name))\n```\n\nThis code results in an error because even though we know there is at most one nation with key 4 for each region, PyDough doesn't know this and prohibits the operation.\n\nThe correct way to handle this is:\n\n```python\n%%pydough\nnation_4 = nations.WHERE(key == 4).SINGULAR()\npydough.to_df(regions.CALCULATE(name, nation_4_name=nation_4.name))\n```\n\n## Good Examples of SINGULAR Usage\n\nThe documentation [edc4690] provides two good examples of proper `SINGULAR` usage:\n\n**Example 1**: Accessing the package cost of the most recent package ordered by each person:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\nmost_recent_package = packages.WHERE(\n    RANKING(by=order_date.DESC(), levels=1) == 1\n).SINGULAR()\n\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    ssn,\n    first_name,\n    middle_name,\n    last_name,\n    most_recent_package_cost=most_recent_package.package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis is valid because the filter ensures there is only one record for each person.\n\n**Example 2**: Accessing the email of the current occupant of each address with a specific name:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\njs = current_occupants.WHERE(\n    (first_name == \"John\") &\n    (last_name == \"Smith\") &\n    ABSENT(middle_name)\n).SINGULAR()\n\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    address_id,\n    john_smith_email=DEFAULT_TO(js.email, \"NO JOHN SMITH LIVING HERE\")\n)\n```\n\nThis is valid if it's safe to assume each address has at most one current occupant named \"John Smith\" without a middle name.\n\n## Bad Example of SINGULAR Usage\n\nThe documentation [edc4690] also provides an example of incorrect usage:\n\n```py\n%%pydough\nAddresses.CALCULATE(\n    package_id=current_occupants.WHERE(\n        first_name == \"John\"\n    ).SINGULAR().packages.package_id\n)\n```\n\nThis is invalid because:\n1. Each address might have multiple current occupants named John\n2. Even if `current_occupants` were singular after using `SINGULAR()`, `packages` is a plural sub-collection of `current_occupants`\n\n## Important Best Practices\n\nThe documentation emphasizes [edc4690, eb3ac75]:\n\n> It is very important that this only be used if the user is certain that the data will be singular, since otherwise it can result in undefined behavior when the PyDough code is executed.\n\nThis is a critical best practice - only use `SINGULAR()` when you are absolutely certain that the operation will result in at most one record per parent record.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe primary function of `SINGULAR` in PyDough is to explicitly mark a sub-collection as containing at most one record per parent record, allowing direct access to its scalar properties in a collection context. This is necessary because PyDough enforces strict rules about accessing properties of potentially plural sub-collections to prevent ambiguity and undefined behavior."}]}]}

As stated in [4766684]:\n\n> Aggregation functions are a special set of functions that, when called on their inputs, convert them from plural to singular.\n\nThis is particularly important in PyDough because when dealing with sub-collections, you need to use aggregation functions to make plural values usable in calculations.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe documentation provides this example of using `SUM` [4766684]:\n\n```py\nNations.CALCULATE(total_consumer_wealth = SUM(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `Nations` is a collection\n- `customers` is a sub-collection of `Nations`\n- `acctbal` is a property of the `customers` sub-collection\n- `SUM(customers.acctbal)` calculates the total sum of all account balances for all customers in each nation\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using `SUM(collection)`, PyDough:\n\n1. Takes a plural set of numerical values (multiple values from a collection)\n2. Calculates the sum of those values\n3. Returns a single value (making it singular with respect to the parent collection)\n\nThis transformation from plural to singular is critical for performing calculations in PyDough, as explained in [4766684]:\n\n> When terms of a plural sub-collection are accessed, those terms are plural with regards to the current collection... The exception to this is when `customers.acctbal` is made singular with regards to `Nations` by aggregating it.\n\n## PyDough Conventions and Best Practices\n\nThe `SUM` function follows PyDough's convention of using uppercase for built-in functions. It's typically used within a `CALCULATE` method to derive new properties based on aggregations of sub-collections.\n\nAs shown in the documentation [79d3c82], aggregation functions like `SUM` are commonly used in PyDough's `CALCULATE` method to create derived values:\n\n```py\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n  name=JOIN_STRINGS(\"\", first_name, last_name),\n  n_packages_ordered=COUNT(packages),\n)\n```\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked what calculation `SUM(collection)` performs. Based on the documentation, `SUM(collection)` calculates the total sum of all numerical values in the specified collection, converting a plural set of values into a single value that can be used in further calculations.\n\nThe function is particularly useful when you need to aggregate values from a sub-collection to use in calculations at the parent collection level."}]}]}

Mental Model and Syntax Approach\n\nPyDough uses a hierarchical thinking model that's closer to human linguistics, while SQL uses a relational model [988171e]:\n\n> \"PyDough allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking, as seen in models such as MongoDB, since that mental model is closer to human linguistics than a relational model.\" [988171e]\n\nThis fundamental difference means PyDough code often looks more similar to the natural language question being asked than SQL would [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> \"When a question is being asked, the PyDough code to answer it will look more similar to the text of the question than the SQL text would. This makes LLM generation of PyDough code simpler since there is a stronger correlation between a question asked and the PyDough code to answer it.\" [7ea5a7b]\n\n### 2. Join Handling and Relationship Representation\n\nPyDough abstracts away joins in favor of logical relationships [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> \"ORMs still require understanding & writing SQL, including dealing directly with joins. If a human or AI is bad at writing SQL, they will be just as bad at writing ORM-based code. PyDough, on the other hand, abstracts away joins in favor of thinking about logical relationships between collections & sub-collections.\" [7ea5a7b]\n\nIn SQL, joins must be explicitly represented, and decisions like LEFT vs INNER join impact correctness [8e03891]:\n\n> \"The example SQL requires a nested subquery to answer, which can easily become complicated and unmanagable as questions scale in size. It also requires explicitly representing the join information where a decision like **LEFT** vs **INNER** join impacts correctness and is a function of the data.\" [8e03891]\n\nIn contrast, PyDough encodes join information in the metadata [8e03891]:\n\n> \"In constrast, PyDough has a simpler representation, avoiding some of the redundancy in the SQL code and the join information is encoded entirely in the metadata.\" [8e03891]\n\n### 3. Code Complexity and Compactness\n\nPyDough code is typically more compact than equivalent SQL [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> \"Often, PyDough code will be significantly more compact than equivalent SQL text, and therefore easier for a human to verify for logical correctness.\" [7ea5a7b]\n\nThis is demonstrated in the comparison example [8e03891] where a complex SQL query with nested subqueries is contrasted with a more concise PyDough solution:\n\nSQL example:\n```SQL\nSelect\n (L_EXTENDED_PRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) / order_total as revenue_ratio,\n orderkey,\n l_linenumber as line_number\nfrom lines\ninner join (\n select\n o_orderkey as order_key,\n SUM(L_EXTENDED_PRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) as order_total\n from orders\n inner join lines\n on l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n group by o_orderkey\n)\non l_orderkey = order_key\norder by revenue_ratio ASC, order_key DESC, line_number DESC\nLIMIT 5\n```\n\nPyDough equivalent:\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\norders.CALCULATE(total_line_price=SUM(lines.CALCULATE(line_price=revenue_def).line_price)).lines.CALCULATE(\n revenue_ratio=revenue_def / total_line_price, \n order_key=order_key, \n line_number=line_number\n).TOP_K(5, by=(revenue_ratio.ASC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC()))\n```\n\n### 4. Execution Model\n\nPyDough uses lazy evaluation [988171e]:\n\n> \"PyDough code can be written in and interleaved with Python code, and practices a lazy evaluation scheme that does not qualify or execute any logic until requested.\" [988171e]\n\nThis allows for building expressions that are meaningless until the final context [8e03891]:\n\n> \"This might seem shocking. We have defined `revenue_def` out of nowhere using an `extended_price` and `discount`. What has actually happened here is that we have generated what is called a `Contextless Expression`. This fundamental building block is the key to PyDough's composability.\" [8e03891]\n\n### 5. Abstraction of Complex SQL Semantics\n\nPyDough abstracts away complex SQL semantics [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> \"The complex semantics of aggregation keys, different types of joins, and aggregating before vs after joining are all abstracted away by PyDough. These details require much deeper understanding of SQL semantics than most have time to learn how to do correctly, meaning that PyDough can have a lower learning curve to write correct code for complex questions.\" [7ea5a7b]\n\n### 6. Implementation Approach\n\nPyDough uses a logical document model rather than a physical one [988171e]:\n\n> \"Unlike MongoDB, PyDough only uses a logical document model for abstractly explaining & interacting with data, rather than a physical document model to store the data.\" [988171e]\n\nAnd it ultimately translates to SQL for execution [988171e]:\n\n> \"PyDough executes by translating its logic into SQL which it can directly executing in an arbitrary database.\" [988171e]\n\nThis provides database portability [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> \"PyDough is portable between various database execution solutions, so you are not locked into one data storage solution while using PyDough.\" [7ea5a7b]\n\nIn summary, PyDough fundamentally differs from SQL by using a hierarchical thinking model that's closer to human language, abstracting away complex SQL concepts like joins and aggregation semantics, providing more compact code, and offering a logical document model that ultimately translates to SQL for execution."}]}]}

These functions appear in the \"Collection Operators\" section of the PyDough DSL Specification [0e3bd07].\n\n## Function Behavior\n\nWhile the search results don't provide explicit documentation of what `MIN(collection)` and `MAX(collection)` return, we can infer their behavior from the context and examples:\n\n1. MIN and MAX are aggregation functions that operate on collections\n2. They appear to return the minimum and maximum values from a collection, respectively\n3. They can be used in CALCULATE operations to create new terms\n\n## Usage Patterns\n\nThe search results show several examples of PyDough code patterns where aggregation functions (like COUNT) are used, which would follow similar patterns to MIN and MAX:\n\nFrom [da99528], we can see aggregation functions being used in CALCULATE operations:\n```python\nTPCH.nations.WHERE(region.name == 'EUROPE').CALCULATE(COUNT(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\nFrom [f5925dc], we can see an example with AVG:\n```\nThe term is the following expression: AVG($1.acctbal)\n\nThis expression calls the function 'AVG' on the following arguments, aggregating them into a single value for each record of the collection:\ncustomers.acctbal\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using MIN or MAX in PyDough:\n\n1. The collection is evaluated\n2. The MIN/MAX function aggregates values from the collection into a single value\n3. This aggregated value becomes available as a term that can be used in CALCULATE operations\n\nAs shown in [f5925dc], aggregation functions like these transform plural expressions into singular expressions with respect to the collection, meaning they can be placed directly in a CALCULATE clause.\n\n## PyDough Best Practices\n\nThe search results [f5925dc] demonstrate that aggregation functions like MIN and MAX should be used to transform plural expressions into singular expressions that can be used in CALCULATE operations:\n\n```\nThis term is singular with regards to the collection, meaning it can be placed in a CALCULATE of a collection.\n\nFor example, the following is valid:\nTPCH.nations.WHERE(region.name == 'EUROPE').CALCULATE(AVG(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\n## PyDough Conventions\n\nPyDough follows a convention where:\n- Aggregation functions (like MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT) transform plural expressions into singular expressions\n- These functions can be used in CALCULATE clauses to create new terms\n- They follow a functional syntax pattern: FUNCTION(expression)\n\n## Addressing the Original Question\n\nWhile the search results don't explicitly state what values `MIN(collection)` and `MAX(collection)` return, based on the context and naming conventions, we can infer that:\n\n- `MIN(collection)` returns the minimum value from the collection\n- `MAX(collection)` returns the maximum value from the collection\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the search results don't provide explicit documentation of these specific functions' return values.\n\n## Exploration APIs\n\nThe search results [2d92a7e] and [eb57e42] mention exploration APIs like `pydough.explain` and `pydough.explain_term` that could be used to get more information about these functions:\n\n```python\npydough.explain_term(collection, MIN(expression), verbose=True)\n```\n\nThis would provide detailed information about how the MIN function works in the context of that collection."}]}]}

The `TOP_K` Function\n\nThe `TOP_K` function in PyDough is used to select the top N records based on specified ordering criteria. As shown in [a10c3db], it has the following syntax:\n\n```python\ncollection.TOP_K(\n    N, by=(expression1.DESC(), expression2.DESC(), ...)\n)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `N` is the number of records to return\n- `by` specifies the ordering criteria, with each expression followed by `.DESC()` for descending order or `.ASC()` for ascending order\n\n### 2. Data Flow and Transformations\n\nTo implement a \"top N per category\" query in PyDough, the typical pattern involves:\n\n1. Filtering the data to the relevant subset using `WHERE`\n2. Calculating necessary metrics using `CALCULATE`\n3. Applying the `TOP_K` function with appropriate ordering\n\nFor example, in [aef202c], we see this pattern used to find the top 3 Asian countries by order count:\n\n```python\nasian_countries = nations.WHERE(region.name == \"ASIA\")\norders_1995 = customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)\nasian_countries_info = asian_countries.CALCULATE(country_name=LOWER(name), total_orders=COUNT(orders_1995))\ntop_asian_countries = asian_countries_info.TOP_K(3, by=total_orders.DESC())\n```\n\n### 3. Best Practices Demonstrated\n\nThe search results demonstrate several best practices for implementing \"top N per category\" queries:\n\n- Breaking down complex queries into smaller, reusable components [aef202c]\n- Using descriptive variable names for intermediate results\n- Applying filters early in the process to reduce the data volume\n- Using `CALCULATE` to define the metrics needed for sorting\n\n### 4. PyDough Conventions\n\nThe examples follow PyDough conventions by:\n\n- Using a declarative approach rather than imperative programming\n- Leveraging the hierarchical document model to express relationships\n- Using method chaining for readability\n- Applying sorting with `.DESC()` or `.ASC()` modifiers\n\n### 5. Multiple Sorting Criteria\n\nFor more complex ordering, PyDough allows multiple sorting criteria in the `TOP_K` function. From [a10c3db]:\n\n```python\nhighest_ratios = filtered_ratios.TOP_K(\n  5, by=(revenue_ratio.DESC(), order_key.DESC(), line_number.DESC())\n)\n```\n\nThis allows for tie-breaking when multiple records have the same primary sorting value.\n\n### 6. Execution and Visualization\n\nAfter defining the query, you can execute it and convert the results to a pandas DataFrame using:\n\n```python\npydough.to_df(top_asian_countries)\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo implement a \"top N per category\" query in PyDough, you would typically:\n1. Filter to the relevant category using `WHERE`\n2. Calculate necessary metrics with `CALCULATE`\n3. Apply `TOP_K` with appropriate sorting criteria\n4. Execute the query with `pydough.to_df()`\n\nThis approach leverages PyDough's hierarchical thinking model to express complex analytical questions in a more intuitive way than traditional SQL."}]}]}

Examples include:\n\n- `SUM`: Returns the sum of a plural set of numerical values [60f366b]\n- `AVG`: Takes the average of a plural set of numerical values [60f366b]\n- `COUNT`: Returns how many non-null records exist in a set of plural values [60f366b]\n- `MIN`: Returns the smallest value from a set of values [60f366b]\n- `MAX`: Returns the largest value from a set of values [60f366b]\n\nFor example, when using `AVG`:\n```py\nNations.CALCULATE(total_consumer_wealth = SUM(customers.acctbal))\n```\n\n### Window Functions\n\nIn contrast, window functions in PyDough operate differently as described in [a172ab8]:\n\n> \"Window functions are special functions whose output depends on other records in the same context. A common example of this is finding the ranking of each record if all of the records were to be sorted.\"\n\nThe key distinction is that window functions:\n1. Produce a result for each record based on its relationship to other records\n2. Allow for specifying the \"window\" or scope of records to consider using the `levels` parameter\n3. Maintain the number of records rather than reducing them to a single value\n\nExamples of window functions include:\n\n- `RANKING`: Returns ordinal position when records are sorted [a172ab8]\n- `PERCENTILE`: Returns which index a record belongs to when records are split into buckets [a172ab8]\n- `RELCOUNT`: Returns the number of non-null records in multiple rows [0a7d61d]\n- `RELAVG`: Returns the average of a singular expression across multiple rows [0a7d61d]\n\n## The `levels` Parameter\n\nA distinctive feature of window functions is the optional `levels` parameter [a172ab8]:\n\n> \"Window functions in PyDough have an optional `levels` argument. If this argument is omitted, it means that the window function applies to all records of the current collection (e.g. rank all customers). If it is provided, it should be a value that can be used as an argument to `BACK`, and in that case it means that the set of values used by the window function should be per-record of the correspond ancestor (e.g. rank all customers within each nation).\"\n\nThis allows for flexible scoping of the window function, as shown in this example [a172ab8]:\n\n```py\n# (no levels) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(...))\n\n# (levels=1) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same nation\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=1))\n\n# (levels=2) rank every customer relative to other customers in the same region\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=2))\n\n# (levels=3) rank every customer relative to all other customers\nRegions.nations.customers.CALCULATE(r=RANKING(..., levels=3))\n```\n\n## Summary of Differences\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - Aggregation functions: Convert plural values to singular values (many-to-one)\n   - Window functions: Produce results for each record based on its relationship to other records (many-to-many)\n\n2. **Scope Control**:\n   - Aggregation functions: Apply to the entire set of values they are called on\n   - Window functions: Can specify the scope using the `levels` parameter to control which records are considered\n\n3. **Result Cardinality**:\n   - Aggregation functions: Reduce multiple records to a single value\n   - Window functions: Maintain the number of records, producing a result for each input record\n\n4. **Typical Use Cases**:\n   - Aggregation functions: Computing totals, averages, counts across a collection\n   - Window functions: Ranking, percentiles, relative comparisons between records\n\nThis explanation addresses the original question by clarifying how window functions and aggregation functions differ in terms of the scope of data they consider and how they process that data."}]}]}

According to the documentation [7a617df]:\n\n```python\n# Returns the number of days between January 1, 1992 and the order date\nOrders.CALCULATE(\n    days_since=DATEDIFF(\"days\", datetime.date(1992, 1, 1), order_date)\n)\n```\n\n## Timestamp Precision and Units\n\nThe `DATEDIFF` function supports various units of time, and its behavior with timestamp precision depends on the unit specified. From the documentation [0cf886c], we can see that the function supports week-based calculations that are affected by configuration settings.\n\nThe function takes three arguments:\n1. The unit of time (e.g., 'days', 'hours')\n2. The first date/timestamp\n3. The second date/timestamp\n\n## Configuration Settings Affecting DATEDIFF\n\nPyDough provides configuration settings that affect how `DATEDIFF` handles certain units, particularly weeks [96f9c2c]:\n\n```python\n# Understanding the behavior of DATEDIFF with `start of week`\n\n# Set the start of the week to Monday\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.MONDAY\n\n# This would return 0, as the difference between March 20, 2025(Thursday) and\n# March 17, 2025(Monday) is 0 weeks when the start of week is considered to be\n# Monday. This is because both these dates fall on the same week.\nTPCH.calculate(diff = DATEDIFF(\"2025-03-17\", \"2025-03-20\", \"week\")) # diff = 0\n\n# Set the start of the week to Thursday\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.Thursday\n\n# This would return 1, as the difference between March 20, 2025 (Thursday)\n# and March 17, 2025 (Monday) is 1 week when the start of week is considered\n# to be Thursday. This is because March 17, 2025 belongs to the week starting\n# from March 13, 2025 (the recent Thursday for it) and March 20, 2025 belongs\n# to the week starting from March 20, 2025 (the recent Thursday).\nTPCH.calculate(diff = DATEDIFF(\"2025-03-17\", \"2025-03-20\", \"week\")) # diff = 1\n```\n\nThe documentation [0cf886c] also notes: \"DATEDIFF function related to week does not depend on the `start_week_as_zero` config.\"\n\n## Supported Time Units\n\nThe documentation [7a617df] mentions that the first argument in the `DATEDIFF` function supports various aliases for each unit of time. The argument is case-insensitive, and if a unit is not one of the provided options, an error will be thrown. The documentation refers to the `DATETIME` function for the supported units and their aliases, indicating that both functions use the same time unit specifications.\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\nWhile the documentation doesn't explicitly state best practices for using `DATEDIFF` with different precision levels, it does demonstrate:\n\n1. The importance of understanding configuration settings when working with week-based calculations\n2. The need to specify the appropriate time unit for the desired precision level\n3. The ability to use either string literals or date objects as inputs\n\n## Summary\n\nThe `DATEDIFF` function in PyDough handles timestamp precision by allowing users to specify the unit of time for the calculation. The precision of the result depends on the unit specified (days, hours, etc.). For week-based calculations, the function's behavior is influenced by the `start_of_week` configuration setting, which determines which day is considered the first day of the week.\n\nThe documentation doesn't provide specific examples for units like 'hours', but it does indicate that the function supports various time units similar to those used by the `DATETIME` function, and that the unit specification is case-insensitive."}]}]}

According to [79d3c82], a core PyDough operation is:\n\n> A core PyDough operation is the ability to filter the records of a collection. This is done by appending a PyDough collection with `.WHERE(cond)` where `cond` is any expression that could have been placed in a `CALCULATE` term and should have a True/False value. Every record where `cond` evaluates to True will be preserved, and the rest will be dropped from the answer.\n\n## Down-Streaming in PyDough\n\nA key concept for understanding how calculated averages work in WHERE clauses is \"down-streaming.\" As explained in [e67e9de]:\n\n> Whenever an expression is defined inside of a `CALCULATE` call, it is available to all descendants of the current context using the same name. However, to avoid ambiguity, this means that descendants invoke or create any properties they have that share a name with one of these terms from an ancestor `CALCULATE`.\n\nThis means that values calculated in a parent context can be referenced in child contexts, including WHERE clauses.\n\n## Example of Using Calculated Values in WHERE Clauses\n\nWhile the specific 'Complex Transaction Filtering' example with `cus_tick_typ_avg_shares`, `cust_tick_avg_shares`, and `cust_avg_shares` isn't directly shown in the search results, we can understand the pattern from similar examples.\n\nFrom [880905f], we can see a pattern of calculating values and then using them in WHERE clauses:\n\n```python\nselected_lines = parts.WHERE(\n (brand == \"Brand#23\") & (container == \"MED BOX\")\n).CALCULATE(\n avg_quantity=AVG(lines.quantity)\n).lines.WHERE(quantity < 0.2 * avg_quantity)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n1. First, parts are filtered by brand and container\n2. Then an average quantity is calculated\n3. Finally, that calculated average is used in a WHERE clause to filter lines where the quantity is less than 20% of the average\n\n## Bad Example Demonstrating Scope Issues\n\nFrom [79d3c82], there's a bad example that illustrates what happens when calculated values aren't properly scoped:\n\n```python\ncust_info = Customers.CALCULATE(\navg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n)\n\nCustomers.packages.CALCULATE(\nis_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis example fails because \"Even though `cust_info` has defined `avg_package_cost`, the final expression `Customers.packages.CALCULATE(...)` does not have `cust_info` as an ancestor, so it cannot access `avg_package_cost` since it is not part of its own ancestry.\"\n\n## Good Example of Using Calculated Averages in WHERE\n\nA correct implementation from [79d3c82] shows:\n\n```python\nCustomers.CALCULATE(\navg_package_cost=AVG(packages.cost)\n).packages.CALCULATE(\nis_above_avg=cost > avg_package_cost\n)\n```\n\nThis pattern is likely similar to how the calculated averages (`cus_tick_typ_avg_shares`, `cust_tick_avg_shares`, `cust_avg_shares`) would be used in the 'Complex Transaction Filtering' example - they would be calculated at a higher level and then referenced in a WHERE clause to filter transactions based on comparison to these averages.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn PyDough, calculated averages like `cus_tick_typ_avg_shares`, `cust_tick_avg_shares`, and `cust_avg_shares` would be:\n1. Calculated in a parent context using CALCULATE\n2. Made available to child contexts through down-streaming\n3. Referenced in WHERE clauses to filter records based on comparisons to these averages\n4. Used to create complex filtering logic by comparing current values to calculated averages\n\nThis pattern allows for sophisticated filtering based on aggregated values, which is particularly useful in transaction analysis."}]}]}

It's similar to the `ORDER_BY` operation but with the additional step of limiting the results to the top `k` records.\n\nFrom the documentation [da99528]:\n> \"The `TOP_K` operation also sorts a collection, but then uses the ordered results in order to pick the first `k`, values, where `k` is a provided constant.\"\n\n## Examples from Documentation\n\n### Good Example 1 [da99528]:\n```python\nPeople.CALCULATE(\n    first_name,\n    last_name,\n    birth_date,\n    n_packages=COUNT(packages)\n).TOP_K(10, by=(n_packages.DESC(), ssn.ASC()))\n```\nThis example finds the 10 people who have ordered the most packages, with ties broken by the lowest SSN.\n\n### Good Example 2 [da99528]:\n```python\nPackages.TOP_K(5, by=order_date.DESC())\n```\nThis finds the 5 most recently shipped packages.\n\n## Invalid Usage Examples\n\nThe documentation also provides examples of invalid usage [da99528]:\n\n### Bad Example 3:\n```python\nPeople.WHERE(\n    current_address.city == \"San Francisco\"\n).TOP_K(100)\n```\nThis is invalid because the `by` clause is absent.\n\n### Bad Example 4:\n```python\nPackages.TOP_K(by=package_cost.DESC())\n```\nThis is invalid because there is no `k` value.\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nWhen using `TOP_K`, PyDough:\n1. Sorts the collection according to the collation terms provided in the `by` argument\n2. Limits the results to the first `k` records\n3. Preserves all terms in the collection (the only changes are the order and which records are kept/dropped) [da99528]\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThe documentation [da99528] mentions two configuration options that affect `TOP_K` behavior:\n- `collation_default_asc` - Controls the default collation direction\n- `propagate_collation` - Controls whether to propagate the collation if the current expression is not a collation expression\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe original question asked about the two mandatory arguments for the `TOP_K` method. The documentation clearly identifies these as:\n1. `k` - The number of top records to return\n2. `by` - The collation term(s) that define the sorting order\n\nBoth arguments are required for proper functioning of the `TOP_K` method, as demonstrated by the invalid examples where omitting either argument results in an error."}]}]}

The function appears to handle date transformations based on configuration settings.\n\n## Key Examples and Usage\n\nFrom source [96f9c2c], we can see examples of how the `DATETIME` function works with the \"start of week\" unit:\n\n```python\n# Understanding the behavior of DATETIME with `start of week`\n# Set the start of the week to Monday\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.MONDAY\n\n# This would set `dt` to the start of the week for March 20, 2025 (Wednesday)\n# to be March 17, 2025 (recent Monday)\nTPCH.calculate(dt = DATETIME(\"2025-03-20\", \"start of week\")) # dt = 2025-03-17\n\n# start_of_week is set to Thursday,\nconfigs.start_of_week = DayOfWeek.Thursday\n\n# This would set `dt` to the start of the week for March 20, 2025 (Thursday)\n# to be March 20, 2025 (recent Thursday)\nTPCH.calculate(dt = DATETIME(\"2025-03-20\", \"start of week\")) # dt = 2025-03-20\n```\n\n## Configuration Settings\n\nThe `DATETIME` function's behavior is influenced by configuration settings in PyDough. Specifically, from [96f9c2c], we can see that:\n\n1. The `start_of_week` configuration affects how the \"start of week\" unit is interpreted\n2. The function supports different time units, with \"start of week\" being one example\n3. The behavior can be customized through the PyDough session configuration\n\nThe documentation states:\n```\nThe following configs are used in the behavior of `DAYOFWEEK`, `DATETIME`, and `DATEDIFF`:\n\n5. `start_of_week` (default=`DayOfWeek.SUNDAY`): Determines which day is considered the first day of the week. This affects the following functions:\n\n`DAYOFWEEK` : A function that returns the number of days since the start of the week. Start of week is relative to the `start_of_week` config.\n\n`DATETIME` : This function also supports the `start of week` unit, which is relative to the `start_of_week` config.\n\n`DATEDIFF` : This function also supports difference between two dates in terms of weeks, which is relative to the `start_of_week` config.\n```\n\n## PyDough Patterns and Best Practices\n\nFrom the examples, we can observe that:\n\n1. The `DATETIME` function is typically used within a `calculate()` method to create derived date values\n2. It follows PyDough's convention of using uppercase for built-in functions\n3. It integrates with PyDough's configuration system for customizable behavior\n\n## Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe `DATETIME` function appears to:\n1. Take a date input (as a string in the examples)\n2. Take a unit parameter that specifies the transformation to apply\n3. Return a transformed date value based on the specified unit and configuration settings\n\n## Limitations of This Documentation\n\nThe provided search results don't contain the complete documentation for the `DATETIME` function. We don't have information about:\n- All supported units beyond \"start of week\"\n- The complete signature of the function\n- All possible return types\n- Other configuration options that might affect its behavior\n\nFor complete documentation, users should refer to the PyDough functions documentation mentioned in [7ea5a7b]: \"List of builtin PyDough functions](https://github.com/bodo-ai/PyDough/blob/main/documentation/functions.md)\"."}]}]}

However, I notice that the \"Pydough Answer\" section in the query is blank, suggesting there wasn't a specific answer provided to analyze.\n\nBased on the search results provided, I'll explain how to check if a collection representing a to-many relationship is completely empty in PyDough.\n\n# Checking if a Collection is Empty in PyDough\n\nIn PyDough, to check if a collection (particularly one representing a to-many relationship) is completely empty, you would use the `HAS()` function with a logical NOT operation.\n\n## The HAS() Function\n\nThe `HAS()` function is a PyDough-specific function that checks for the existence of elements in a collection. When used with a NOT operation, it can determine if a collection is completely empty.\n\nThe pattern would be:\n```python\nNOT(HAS(collection_name))\n```\n\nThis pattern follows PyDough conventions for checking emptiness of collections. The `HAS()` function returns `True` if the collection has at least one element, and `False` if it's empty. By applying `NOT()` to this result, you get `True` when the collection is empty and `False` when it has elements.\n\n## Example in Context\n\nBased on the search results, we can see examples of collection relationships in PyDough. For instance, in [7fc8fe3], we see relationships like:\n\n```\n\"reverse_relationship_name\": \"shipped_packages\"\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n\"reverse_relationship_name\": \"billed_packages\"\n```\n\nThese represent to-many relationships between collections.\n\nTo check if one of these collections is empty (e.g., to check if there are no shipped packages for an address), you would use:\n\n```python\nNOT(HAS(address.shipped_packages))\n```\n\n## Data Flow and Best Practices\n\nWhen using this pattern:\n1. The subcollection is accessed (e.g., `address.shipped_packages`)\n2. The `HAS()` function checks for the existence of at least one element\n3. The `NOT()` operation inverts the result\n\nThis approach is efficient because it only needs to check for the existence of elements rather than counting them, which would be less efficient for large collections.\n\nWhile I don't see explicit examples of `NOT(HAS())` in the provided search results, this is the standard PyDough pattern for checking if a collection is empty based on the PyDough DSL and function conventions."}]}]}
{"systemInstruction": {"role": "system", "parts": [{"text": "You are an analytics expert and a proficient Pydough generator that creates Python code based on natural language descriptions."}]}, "contents": [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "How is access to collections and sub-collections achieved syntactically in PyDough?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "# Explanation of Collection and Sub-Collection Access in PyDough\n\nThe original question asks about the syntactic approach for accessing collections and sub-collections in PyDough. Based on the provided documentation, I'll explain how this is achieved in PyDough.\n\n## Collection Access in PyDough\n\nIn PyDough, collections are accessed by simply using their name. This is the most basic form of PyDough code.\n\nAs stated in the documentation [0e3bd07]:\n\n> The simplest PyDough code is scanning an entire collection. This is done by providing the name of the collection in the metadata.\n\nFor example, to access the `People` collection, you would simply write:\n\n```python\nPeople\n```\n\nThis would return all records in the `People` collection with all scalar properties automatically included in the output [0e3bd07].\n\n## Sub-Collection Access in PyDough\n\nSub-collections in PyDough are accessed using dot notation. This allows for traversing relationships between collections.\n\nFrom the documentation [0e3bd07]:\n\n> **Sub-Collections**\n>\n> Collections can have sub-collections, which are accessed using the dot notation.\n\nFor example, using the example graph described in the documentation [7fc8fe3], you could access:\n\n```python\nPeople.current_address\n```\n\nThis would access the `current_address` sub-collection of the `People` collection, which connects to the `Addresses` collection.\n\n## Relationship Types and Cardinality\n\nThe documentation shows that sub-collection relationships can have different cardinalities [7fc8fe3]:\n\n1. **One-to-One**: When a person has at most one current address\n   ```python\n   People.current_address  # Returns at most one address per person\n   ```\n\n2. **One-to-Many**: When a person can have multiple packages\n   ```python\n   People.packages_ordered  # Returns multiple packages per person\n   ```\n\n3. **Reverse Relationships**: Sub-collections can be accessed from either direction\n   ```python\n   Addresses.current_occupants  # Reverse of People.current_address\n   Packages.customer  # Reverse of People.packages_ordered\n   ```\n\n## Chaining Sub-Collection Access\n\nThe dot notation can be chained to navigate through multiple relationships. For example [0e3bd07]:\n\n```python\nPeople.packages.shipping_address\n```\n\nThis would access the shipping address of each package ordered by each person, traversing through multiple collections.\n\n## Metadata Definition of Relationships\n\nThe relationships between collections are defined in the metadata. For example, in the provided metadata [7fc8fe3], the relationship between `People` and `Addresses` through the `current_address` property is defined with:\n\n```json\n\"current_address\": {\n  \"type\": \"simple_join\",\n  \"other_collection_name\": \"Addresses\",\n  \"singular\": true,\n  \"no_collisions\": false,\n  \"keys\": {\n    \"current_address_id\": [\"aid\"]\n  },\n  \"reverse_relationship_name\": \"current_occupants\"\n}\n```\n\nThis metadata defines:\n- The type of join\n- The target collection\n- Whether the relationship is singular (one-to-one)\n- The keys used for joining\n- The name of the reverse relationship\n\n## Exploration APIs for Understanding Relationships\n\nPyDough provides exploration APIs to help understand the structure of collections and their relationships [2e54fa8]:\n\n```python\npydough.explain(graph[\"nations\"][\"customers\"], verbose=True)\n```\n\nThis would output information about the relationship:\n\n```\nPyDough property: nations.customers\nThis property connects collection nations to customers.\nCardinality of connection: One -> Many\nIs reversible: yes\nReverse property: customers.nation\nThe subcollection relationship is defined by the following join conditions:\nnations.key == customers.nation_key\n```\n\n## Best Practices and Conventions\n\nThe documentation suggests several best practices for working with collections and sub-collections:\n\n1. Use the built-in exploration APIs (`explain`, `explain_structure`, `explain_term`) to understand the structure of collections and their relationships [eb57e42].\n\n2. Leverage the hierarchical thinking model that PyDough provides, which is closer to human linguistics than a relational model [988171e].\n\n3. Use the dot notation to navigate through relationships rather than explicitly writing joins, as this abstracts away the complexity of SQL joins [988171e].\n\nThis approach to accessing collections and sub-collections in PyDough follows a document-oriented model that simplifies analytics by abstracting away join logic into metadata and focusing on parent-child relationships [a10c3db]."}]}]}

For example, in Python, `10 < quantity < 20` is interpreted as `(10 < quantity) and (quantity < 20)`, but this syntax isn't universally supported or might behave differently in different contexts. `MONOTONIC` provides a consistent way to express these relationships.\n\n3. **Consistent Behavior**: The `MONOTONIC` function ensures that the comparisons are always performed in the same way, regardless of the underlying database or execution environment.\n\n## PyDough Conventions and Best Practices\n\nThe `MONOTONIC` function follows PyDough's convention of providing high-level, intuitive functions that abstract away complex SQL operations. This is consistent with PyDough's philosophy as described in [988171e]:\n\n> PyDough code can be written in and interleaved with Python code, and practices a lazy evaluation scheme that does not qualify or execute any logic until requested.\n> \n> PyDough executes by translating its logic into SQL which it can directly executing in an arbitrary database.\n\nThe function is part of PyDough's built-in functions, which are documented in the functions.md file referenced in [7ea5a7b]:\n\n> [List of builtin PyDough functions](https://github.com/bodo-ai/PyDough/blob/main/documentation/functions.md)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `MONOTONIC` function in PyDough provides a clean, readable way to check if a series of values are in ascending order, which helps avoid potential issues and confusion that can arise from chained comparisons in traditional programming or SQL syntax."}]}]}

They serve as reusable building blocks that can be applied in different contexts throughout PyDough code.\n\n## Purpose of Contextless Expressions\n\nAccording to the documentation, the primary purpose of contextless expressions in PyDough is to enable:\n\n1. **Code Reusability**: Define expressions once and reuse them in multiple contexts [23d4d72]\n2. **Composability**: Build complex queries from simpler components [23d4d72]\n3. **Incremental Development**: Create expressions that are meaningless until placed in a final context [a2efdb3]\n\n## Example from Documentation\n\nThe clearest example of contextless expressions comes from the \"what-if\" analysis notebook [23d4d72]:\n\n```python\nrevenue_def = extended_price*(1-discount)\n```\n\nAs explained in the documentation:\n\n> \"This might seem shocking. We have defined `revenue_def` out of nowhere using an `extended_price` and `discount`. What has actually happened here is that we have generated what is called a `Contextless Expression`. This fundamental building block is the key to PyDough's composability.\" [23d4d72]\n\n> \"On its own this expression doesn't mean anything. In fact if we inspect this object in regular PyDough we will see that PyDough itself has a lot of questions.\" [23d4d72]\n\nThe documentation further explains:\n\n> \"As you see, PyDough now knows that this expression is composed of `extended_price` and `discount`, but it doesn't know **WHICH** `extended_price` and discount. To ultimately develop a legal PyDough statement, we will need to bind uses of this expression to a context that can access `extended_price` and `discount`.\" [23d4d72]\n\n## How Contextless Expressions Work in PyDough\n\nThe documentation demonstrates how these contextless expressions can be used in different contexts:\n\n1. **Global Context** - Computing total revenue across all lines:\n```python\npydough.to_df(TPCH.CALCULATE(total_line_revenue=total_revenue))\n```\n\n2. **Order Context** - Computing revenue per order:\n```python\norder_total_price = orders.CALCULATE(order_revenue=total_revenue)\n```\n\n3. **Limited Context** - Computing for just the top five lines:\n```python\ntop_five_lines = lines.TOP_K(5, by=(line_number.ASC(), order_key.ASC()))\ntop_five_line_price = TPCH.CALCULATE(total_line_revenue=SUM(top_five_lines.CALCULATE(line_revenue=revenue_def).line_revenue))\n```\n\n## Benefits of Contextless Expressions\n\nThe documentation highlights several benefits:\n\n1. **Scalability**: \"This makes testing the underlying behavior much more scalable.\" [23d4d72]\n2. **Verification**: \"To ask is this statement correct, we can instead compose our question to ask: Is this underlying expression correct? Is this context correct?\" [23d4d72]\n3. **Independent Verification**: \"Since these can be verify independently, we can develop greater confidence in our question since it arises from composable building blocks.\" [23d4d72]\n4. **Testing**: \"We could also generate selected contexts to build clear testing.\" [23d4d72]\n\n## PyDough's Design Philosophy\n\nThe documentation explains that contextless expressions are part of PyDough's broader design philosophy:\n\n> \"PyDough code can be written in and interleaved with Python code, and practices a lazy evaluation scheme that does not qualify or execute any logic until requested.\" [988171e]\n\n> \"PyDough as a DSL has several benefits over other solutions, both for human use and LLM generation... When a question is being asked, the PyDough code to answer it will look more similar to the text of the question than the SQL text would.\" [7ea5a7b]\n\nIn summary, contextless expressions in PyDough allow for more modular, reusable, and testable code by separating the definition of expressions from their application in specific contexts. This approach enables incremental development and makes complex queries more manageable by breaking them down into simpler components."}]}]}

This requires:\n1. Counting how many customers each nation has\n2. Identifying nations with exactly one customer\n3. Selecting customers from those nations\n\n## PyDough Solution\n\nBased on the search results, here's how this would be expressed in PyDough:\n\n```python\nCustomers.WHERE(COUNT(nation.customers) == 1)\n```\n\n## Explanation of the Solution\n\n### PyDough Functions and Patterns Used\n\n1. **Collection Access**: The solution starts with the `Customers` collection [da99528], which is a base collection in the data model.\n\n2. **WHERE Function**: The solution uses the `WHERE` function to filter customers based on a condition [4daea60]. This is a standard PyDough pattern for filtering collections.\n\n3. **COUNT Function**: The solution uses `COUNT()` to count the number of customers in each nation [4daea60]. This aggregation function returns the number of elements in a collection.\n\n4. **Navigation Path**: The solution uses `nation.customers` to navigate from a customer to their nation, and then to all customers of that nation [da99528]. This demonstrates PyDough's ability to traverse relationships between collections.\n\n### Data Flow and Transformations\n\nThe data flow in this solution works as follows:\n1. Start with all customers in the `Customers` collection\n2. For each customer, navigate to their nation using the `nation` relationship\n3. From each nation, count all customers using `COUNT(nation.customers)`\n4. Filter to keep only customers whose nation has exactly one customer (where the count equals 1)\n\n### PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated\n\n1. **Concise Expression**: The solution demonstrates PyDough's ability to express complex queries concisely [988171e]. What would require multiple joins and subqueries in SQL is expressed in a single line.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The solution leverages PyDough's hierarchical model to navigate between related entities (customers and nations) [988171e].\n\n3. **Intuitive Filtering**: The solution uses a natural, intuitive filtering pattern that closely matches the English description of the problem [4daea60].\n\n### How This Follows PyDough Conventions\n\nThe solution follows PyDough conventions by:\n1. Starting with a collection (`Customers`)\n2. Using standard PyDough operators (WHERE, COUNT)\n3. Navigating relationships using dot notation\n4. Using comparison operators (==) to create filtering conditions\n\n### How It Addresses the Original Question\n\nThe solution directly addresses the question by:\n1. Identifying nations with exactly one customer through `COUNT(nation.customers) == 1`\n2. Selecting customers from those nations by applying this condition in a WHERE clause on the Customers collection\n\nThis approach correctly identifies customers whose nation has exactly one customer (which would be themselves)."}]}]}
