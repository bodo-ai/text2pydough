2502,What search strings were entered by users who do not own any properties?,SELECT search_string FROM User_Searches EXCEPT SELECT T1.search_string FROM User_Searches AS T1 JOIN Properties AS T2 ON T1.user_id  =  T2.owner_user_id;,"1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the search strings entered by users who do not own any properties. This requires identifying users who have no associated properties and then retrieving the search strings they have entered.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Filter the 'user' collection to find users who do not own any properties. This can be done by checking if the 'property' sub-collection is empty using HASNOT.
b. Access the 'user_search' sub-collection for the filtered users to retrieve their search strings.
c. Calculate the search strings for the users who do not own any properties.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
users_without_properties = user.WHERE(HASNOT(property)==1)
search_strings = users_without_properties.user_search.CALCULATE(search_string=search_string)
result = search_strings
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. The first line filters the 'user' collection to identify users who do not own any properties using `HASNOT(property)==1`. This creates a new collection called `users_without_properties` containing only these users.
b. The second line accesses the 'user_search' sub-collection of the `users_without_properties` collection and calculates the 'search_string' for each search performed by these users.
c. The final line assigns the result to the `result` variable.","users_without_properties = user.WHERE(HASNOT(property)==1)

2499,"What are the first, middle and last names of users who own the property they live in?","SELECT first_name ,  middle_name ,  last_name FROM Properties AS T1 JOIN Users AS T2 ON T1.owner_user_id  =  T2.user_id WHERE T1.property_address_id  =  T2.user_address_id;","1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the first, middle, and last names of users who own the property they live in. This requires joining the `Users` table with the `Properties` table on the `owner_user_id` and filtering based on the condition that the user's address is the same as the property's address. This means the `user_address_id` in the `Users` table must match the `property_address_id` in the `Properties` table.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Join `Users` with `Properties` on `user_id` and `owner_user_id` through the existing relationships.
b. Filter the joined data where the user's address ID is equal to the property's address ID.
c. Select the first name, middle name, and last name of the users who satisfy the condition.

    first_name = first_name,
    middle_name = middle_name,
    last_name = last_name
)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. The `WHERE` clause filters the `Users` collection based on the condition that `user_address_id` is equal to the `address_id` of the property they own. This is achieved by navigating through the relationships: `user.property.address.address_id`.
b. The `CALCULATE` statement selects the `first_name`, `middle_name`, and `last_name` fields from the filtered `Users` collection, providing the desired output.","result = Users.WHERE(user_address_id == user.property.address.address_id).CALCULATE(

The question asks to retrieve the search strings of users who do not own any properties. This requires identifying users without properties and then accessing their search history to extract the search strings.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Identify users who own properties.
b. Identify all users.
c. Find the users who do not own properties by excluding the users who own properties from all users.
d. Retrieve the search strings for the users who do not own properties from the `User_Searches` table.

search_strings = user_search.WHERE(ISIN(user_id, users_without_properties.user_id)).CALCULATE(search_content=search_string)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `users_with_properties = property.CALCULATE(owner_user_id=owner_user_id)`: This line selects all properties and extracts the `owner_user_id` to identify users who own properties.
b. `all_users = user.CALCULATE(user_id=user_id)`: This line selects all users and extracts their `user_id`.
c. `users_without_properties = all_users.WHERE(~ISIN(user_id, users_with_properties.owner_user_id))`: This line filters the `all_users` collection to find users whose `user_id` is not present in the `owner_user_id` of `users_with_properties`, effectively identifying users who do not own any properties.

The question asks for the full names of users who own the properties they live in. This requires joining the `Users` and `Properties` tables based on the user ID and property address ID, and then filtering for users whose `user_address_id` matches the `property_address_id` of the properties they own.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
a. Start with the `Users` collection.
b. Join `Users` with `Properties` where `user_address_id` equals the `property_address_id` of the property owned by the user (owner_user_id).

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the number of cyclists who did not purchase any bike after the year 2015. This requires filtering cyclists based on their purchase history. We need to check if a cyclist has any bike purchase record in the `cyclists_own_bike` table with a `purchase_year` greater than 2015.

The question asks for the name and price of bikes owned by both 'Bradley Wiggins' and 'Antonio Tauler'. This requires finding the intersection of bikes owned by each cyclist. We need to filter cyclists by name, find the bikes they own, and then find the common bikes between the two sets.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**

The question asks for the ids and names of racing bikes that are purchased by at least 4 cyclists. This requires joining the `bikes` and `cyclists_own_bike` tables, counting the number of cyclists who own each bike, filtering for bikes owned by at least 4 cyclists, and then selecting the bike's id and product name.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Group the `cyclists_own_bike` collection by `bike_id` and count the number of cyclists for each bike.
b. Filter the grouped collection to include only bikes owned by at least 4 cyclists.
c. Filter the `bikes` collection to include only bikes whose `id` is in the `bike_id` collection obtained in the previous step. Finally, it selects the `id` and `product_name` of the filtered bikes.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
- Start by joining the `bikes` and `cyclists_own_bike` collections using the `bike` relationship in `cyclists_own_bike`.
- Filter the joined collection where `purchase_year` is greater than 2015.

First, calculate the number of searches for each user.
Second, calculate the number of properties for each user.
Third, filter users based on the number of searches they have performed (<= 2) and the number of properties they own (>= 2).
Finally, select the user_id and last_name for the filtered users.

2525,What is the id and flavor of the cheapest cookie?,"SELECT id ,  flavor FROM goods WHERE food  =  ""Cookie"" ORDER BY price LIMIT 1","1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks for the id and flavor of the cheapest cookie. This requires accessing the `good` collection, filtering for items where the `food` is 'cookie', and then finding the minimum price.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Filter the `good` collection to include only cookies.
   - Order the filtered collection by price in ascending order.
   - Select the top 1 item, which will be the cheapest cookie.
   - Calculate the id and flavor of the cheapest cookie, renaming them to `cookie_id` and `cookie_flavor` respectively.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block:**
```python
cheapest_cookie = bakery_1.good.WHERE(food == ""cookie"").ORDER_BY(price.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=price).CALCULATE(cookie_id=id, cookie_flavor=flavor)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - `bakery_1.good.WHERE(food == ""cookie"")`: This filters the `good` collection to include only records where the `food` field is equal to ""cookie"".
   - `.ORDER_BY(price.ASC())`: This sorts the filtered collection by the `price` field in ascending order.
   - `.TOP_K(1, by=price)`: This selects the top 1 record from the sorted collection, which corresponds to the cookie with the minimum price.
   - `.CALCULATE(cookie_id=id, cookie_flavor=flavor)`: This creates a new collection with the `id` and `flavor` fields renamed to `cookie_id` and `cookie_flavor` respectively.","cheapest_cookie = bakery_1.good.WHERE(food == ""cookie"").ORDER_BY(price.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=price).CALCULATE(cookie_id=id, cookie_flavor=flavor)",False,The generated PyDough code is incorrect because it returns an empty DataFrame instead of the expected cookie ID and flavor. The issue likely lies in the `.CALCULATE` method or the `TOP_K` method. The `.CALCULATE` method might not be correctly extracting and renaming the `id` and `flavor` fields. It's possible that the `by=price` argument in `TOP_K` is interfering with the selection of the correct row. The code should be revised to ensure that the correct `id` and `flavor` are extracted from the cheapest cookie.,3,False,

The question asks for the last names of customers who have more than 10 receipts in the `bakery_1` database. This requires counting the number of receipts associated with each customer and then filtering for those with a count greater than 10.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the `customer` collection in the `bakery_1` database.
   - Calculate the number of receipts for each customer using `COUNT(receipt)`.
   - Filter the customers based on the condition that the number of receipts is greater than 10.

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `bakery_1.good.PARTITION(name=""food_groups"", by=(food))`: This line starts with the 'good' collection and uses the PARTITION function to group the goods by the 'food' attribute. The name ""food_groups"" is assigned to this partition.
b. `.CALCULATE(food=food, average_price=AVG(good.price))`: This line uses the CALCULATE function to calculate the average price for each food group. `food=food` selects the food type, and `average_price=AVG(good.price)` calculates the average price for each group.","avg_price_per_food = bakery_1.good.PARTITION(name=""food_groups"", by=(food)).CALCULATE(

2545,"What are the average, minimum and maximum prices for each food?","SELECT food ,  avg(price) ,  max(price) ,  min(price) FROM goods GROUP BY food","1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks to calculate the average, minimum, and maximum prices for each distinct food item in the `good` collection. This requires grouping the `good` collection by the `food` field and then applying the aggregation functions AVG, MIN, and MAX to the `price` field within each group. The column names in the final result should match the names specified in the question.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the `good` collection.
   - Use the `PARTITION` function to group the `good` collection by the `food` field, creating a new collection named `food_group`.
   - Use the `CALCULATE` function to calculate the average, minimum, and maximum prices for each food group, aliasing the columns to match the expected output.

Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the receipt numbers where both 'cake' and 'cookie' were purchased. This requires identifying receipts that have items with food type 'cake' and items with food type 'cookie'.

- Filter the `item` collection to find items associated with 'cake'.
- Extract the receipt numbers for 'cake' items.
- Filter the `item` collection to find items associated with 'cookie'.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks for the receipt number and date associated with the most expensive item. This requires finding the maximum price among all items and then retrieving the receipt number and date associated with that item through the item table.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
*   First, calculate the maximum price of all goods using `GRAPH.CALCULATE`.
*   Then, filter the `item` collection to find the items whose `good.price` equals the maximum price.
*   Finally, join the filtered `item` collection with the `receipt` collection and select the receipt number and date.

4. Explanation of how the code works
*   The first line calculates the maximum price of all goods and stores it in the `max_price` variable.
*   The second line filters the `item` collection to find the items with the maximum price.
*   The third line filters the `receipt` collection to only include receipts that have the most expensive items. The `CALCULATE` clause selects the `receiptnumber` and `date` fields.

2572,"Which good has ""70"" in its id? And what is its price?","SELECT id ,  price FROM goods WHERE id LIKE ""%70%""","1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks to find the good that has ""70"" in its id and retrieve its id and price. This requires filtering the `good` collection based on a substring search within the `id` field and then selecting the `id` and `price` fields.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
- Start with the `good` collection.
- Use the `WHERE` function with the `CONTAINS` function to filter the goods where the `id` contains ""70"".
- Use the `CALCULATE` function to select the `id` and `price` of the filtered goods.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
goods_with_70 = bakery_1.good.WHERE(CONTAINS(id, ""70"")).CALCULATE(good_id=id, good_price=price)

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
- `bakery_1.good`: This specifies the `good` collection in the `bakery_1` database.
- `.WHERE(CONTAINS(id, ""70""))`: This filters the `good` collection, keeping only the goods where the `id` field contains the substring ""70"".

2567,What distinct receipt numbers correspond to someone who bought a good that costs more than 13 dollars?,SELECT DISTINCT T1.ReceiptNumber FROM receipts AS T1 JOIN items AS T2 ON T1.ReceiptNumber  =  T2.receipt JOIN goods AS T3 ON T2.item  =  T3.id WHERE T3.price  >  13,"1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks for the distinct receipt numbers associated with purchases of goods costing more than $13. This requires joining the `good` and `item` collections to filter by `price` and then joining with the `receipt` collection to extract the `receiptnumber`. Finally, we need to extract the distinct receipt numbers.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the `good` collection.
   - Filter the `good` collection where the `price` is greater than 13.
   - Join with the `item` collection using the `id` and `item` fields.
   - Join with the `receipt` collection using the `receipt` field.
   - Extract the distinct `receiptnumber` from the `receipt` collection.

receipt_numbers = goods.WHERE(price > 13).item.CALCULATE(receipt_number=receipt.receiptnumber).PARTITION(name=""receipts"", by=receipt.receiptnumber).CALCULATE(receiptnumber=receipt.receiptnumber)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - The first line filters the `goods` collection to include only goods with a `price` greater than 13. It then navigates to the `item` collection and calculates the `receipt_number` from the `receipt` collection.
   - The second line partitions the results by `receiptnumber` and then calculates the `receiptnumber` to get the distinct values.","receipt_numbers = goods.WHERE(price > 13).item.CALCULATE(receipt_number=receipt.receiptnumber).PARTITION(name=""receipts"", by=receipt.receiptnumber).CALCULATE(receiptnumber=receipt.receiptnumber)",False,"The generated PyDough code is incorrect because it doesn't properly join the `goods`, `items`, and `receipts` collections. The code attempts to navigate directly between collections without specifying the join conditions. The `CALCULATE` and `PARTITION` functions are used incorrectly, and the code doesn't filter the results effectively. To fix this, the PyDough code needs to explicitly define the joins between the collections using the appropriate join conditions (e.g., `goods.id = items.item` and `items.receipt = receipts.ReceiptNumber`). The `CALCULATE` function should be used to extract the `receiptnumber` after the joins have been established, and a distinct operation should be performed to get the unique receipt numbers.",3,False,

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
- Start with the `good` collection.
- Filter the `good` collection using the `WHERE` clause and the `LIKE` function to find goods whose `id` contains ""70"".
- Use the `CALCULATE` function to select the `id` and `price` fields.

Analysis of the question
The question asks to find all receipts that satisfy either of the two conditions:
1. Has the earliest date.
2. Has an item whose good's price is above 10.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
1. Find the earliest date from all receipts.
2. Filter receipts based on two conditions:
    - The receipt's date is equal to the earliest date.
    - The receipt has an item whose good's price is above 10. This requires checking if any of the receipt's items have a good with a price greater than 10.

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the minimum and maximum prices of food goods, grouped by the 'food' category. This requires using the 'good' collection, calculating the minimum and maximum prices for each food type, and ordering the results by the food type.

a. Start with the 'good' collection.
b. Use the PARTITION function to group the goods by their 'food' type.
c. Use the CALCULATE function to determine the minimum and maximum prices for each food group.
d. The question asks to order by food, but ORDER_BY is not compatible with PARTITION, so we skip this step.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Use the `good` collection as the starting point.
b. Use the `PARTITION` function to group the goods by `flavor`.
c. Use the `CALCULATE` function to calculate the maximum, minimum, and average prices for each flavor.
d. Use the `ORDER_BY` function to order the results by flavor.

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for items with chocolate flavor that were purchased at most 10 times. This requires filtering the 'good' collection for chocolate flavor and then counting the number of times each item was purchased. Finally, filter the results to include only those items purchased at most 10 times.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Filter the 'good' collection to select only the goods with 'chocolate' flavor.
b. Calculate the number of times each chocolate flavored good appears in the 'item' collection.
c. Filter the results to include only those goods that appear at most 10 times.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:

    item_flavor=flavor,
    purchase_count=COUNT(item.receipt)
)
result = item_counts.WHERE(purchase_count <= 10)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `chocolate_goods = bakery_1.good.WHERE(flavor == ""chocolate"")`: This line filters the 'good' collection to select only the goods with 'chocolate' flavor and assigns the result to the variable 'chocolate_goods'.
b. `item_counts = chocolate_goods.CALCULATE(item_id=id, item_food=food, item_flavor=flavor, purchase_count=COUNT(item.receipt))`: This line calculates the number of times each chocolate flavored good appears in the 'item' collection.

2609,Give the ids of goods that are more than twice as expensive as the average good.,SELECT id FROM goods WHERE price  >  (SELECT avg(price) FROM goods),"1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to find the 'id' of goods whose 'price' is more than twice the average 'price' of all goods. This requires calculating the average price of all goods and then filtering the goods based on this calculated average.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, calculate the average price of all goods using the AVG aggregation function. Then, filter the goods collection to include only those goods whose price is more than twice the calculated average price. Finally, select the 'id' of the filtered goods.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
average_price = bakery_1.good.CALCULATE(average_price=AVG(price))
expensive_goods = bakery_1.good.WHERE(price > 2 * average_price.SINGULAR().average_price).CALCULATE(good_id=id)
result = expensive_goods
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first calculates the average price of all goods using `bakery_1.good.CALCULATE(average_price=AVG(price))`. The result is stored in the `average_price` variable. Then, it filters the `bakery_1.good` collection using `bakery_1.good.WHERE(price > 2 * average_price.SINGULAR().average_price)` to select only those goods whose price is more than twice the average price. The `SINGULAR()` function is used to extract the singular average price value from the `average_price` collection. Finally, it selects the `id` of the filtered goods using `.CALCULATE(good_id=id)` and stores the result in the `result` variable.","average_price = bakery_1.good.CALCULATE(average_price=AVG(price))
expensive_goods = bakery_1.good.WHERE(price > 2 * average_price.SINGULAR().average_price).CALCULATE(good_id=id)
result = expensive_goods",False,"The generated response is incorrect. The PyDough code does not produce the correct result. The generated response DataFrame is empty, while the ground truth DataFrame contains several IDs. The issue lies in the PyDough code's logic and syntax. Specifically, the `CALCULATE` function is used incorrectly after the `WHERE` clause. The `CALCULATE` function is used to create new columns or aggregate data, but in this case, it's being used to select the 'id' column after filtering. This is not the correct way to select a column in PyDough after filtering. The correct approach would be to use the `.id` attribute after the `WHERE` clause to access the 'id' column of the filtered goods. The correct PyDough code should be:

```python
average_price = bakery_1.good.CALCULATE(average_price=AVG(price))
expensive_goods = bakery_1.good.WHERE(price > 2 * average_price.SINGULAR().average_price).id
result = expensive_goods
```
This revised code first calculates the average price correctly. Then, it filters the `bakery_1.good` collection to include only those goods whose price is more than twice the calculated average price. Finally, it selects the `id` of the filtered goods using `.id` and stores the result in the `result` variable.",3,False,
2612,Return a list of the id and flavor for Cakes ordered by flavor.,"SELECT id ,  flavor FROM goods WHERE food  =  ""Cake"" ORDER BY flavor","1. **Analysis of the question**

The question asks for a list of the `id` and `flavor` of cakes, ordered by `flavor`. The `good` collection contains the `id` and `flavor` information. The `food` property in the `good` collection can be used to filter for cakes.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**

*   Start with the `good` collection.
*   Filter the `good` collection to include only cakes (where `food` is 'Cake').
*   Use `CALCULATE` to select the `id` and `flavor` fields.
*   Use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results by `flavor` in ascending order.

3.  **The PyDough code in a Python code block**

```python
cakes = bakery_1.good.WHERE(food == 'Cake').CALCULATE(cake_id=id, cake_flavor=flavor).ORDER_BY(flavor.ASC())
```

4.  **Explanation of how the code works**

*   `bakery_1.good.WHERE(food == 'Cake')`: This part starts with the `good` collection and filters it to include only records where the `food` field is equal to 'Cake'.
*   `.CALCULATE(cake_id=id, cake_flavor=flavor)`: This part selects the `id` and `flavor` fields from the filtered collection and renames them to `cake_id` and `cake_flavor` respectively.
*   `.ORDER_BY(flavor.ASC())`: This part sorts the resulting collection by the `flavor` field in ascending order.","cakes = bakery_1.good.WHERE(food == 'Cake').CALCULATE(cake_id=id, cake_flavor=flavor).ORDER_BY(flavor.ASC())",False,"The generated response is incorrect because the PyDough code returns an empty dataframe instead of the expected dataframe with cake id and flavor ordered by flavor.

2618,What is the three most popular goods in this bakery?,SELECT item FROM items GROUP BY item ORDER BY COUNT (*) DESC LIMIT 3,"1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the three most popular goods in the bakery. Popularity is determined by the number of times a good (item) appears in the items table. This requires counting the occurrences of each item in the items table and then selecting the top three.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Group the items by the item name.
b. Count the number of items in each group.
c. Select the top three groups based on the count in descending order.
d. Calculate the item name and the count of items for each of the top three groups.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:

    item_name=""item"",
    item_count=COUNT(bakery_1.item)
).TOP_K(3, by=item_count.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
The code first partitions the `item` collection by `item`, effectively grouping items by their name. Then, it calculates the `item_name` and the `item_count` for each group. Finally, it selects the top 3 items based on the `item_count` in descending order using `TOP_K`.","popular_goods = bakery_1.item.PARTITION(name=""item_partition"", by=(""item"")).CALCULATE(

b. Filter the collection to include only records where `food` is equal to `cake`.
c. Use `CALCULATE` to select the `id` and `flavor` fields, renaming them to `cake_id` and `cake_flavor` respectively.

   - Access the `institutions` collection.
   - Use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of records in the `institutions` collection.
   - Assign the result to a variable named `num_institutions`.

3. **The PyDough code:**
```python
num_institutions = institutions.CALCULATE(number_of_institutions=COUNT(institutions))
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - The code accesses the `institutions` collection.
   - The `CALCULATE` function with `COUNT(institutions)` calculates the total number of institutions and assigns it to the field `number_of_institutions`.
   - The result is stored in the variable `num_institutions`.",num_institutions = institutions.CALCULATE(number_of_institutions=COUNT(institutions)),,,0,True,

The question asks to identify customer IDs for customers whose total spending exceeds $150. This requires calculating the total spending for each customer by summing the prices of goods associated with their receipts and then filtering for customers who meet the specified spending threshold.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Start with the `customer` collection.
b. Calculate the total spending for each customer by summing the prices of goods in their receipts. This involves navigating from `customer` to `receipt` to `item` to `good` and summing the `price` of the `good`.
c. Filter the customers based on the calculated total spending, keeping only those who have spent more than 150 dollars.
d. Select the `id` of the filtered customers.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
customer_spending = bakery_1.customer.CALCULATE(
    total_spent=SUM(receipt.item.good.price)

```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `bakery_1.customer.CALCULATE(total_spent=SUM(receipt.item.good.price))`: This part starts with the `customer` collection and calculates the `total_spent` for each customer. It navigates through the relationships: `receipt` (a customer's receipts), `item` (items in each receipt), and `good` (the good corresponding to each item), summing the `price` of each `good`.
b. `.WHERE(total_spent > 150)`: This filters the customers, keeping only those for whom the calculated `total_spent` is greater than 150.
c. `.CALCULATE(customer_id=id)`: This selects the `id` of the filtered customers and names it `customer_id`.
The final result, `customer_spending`, will contain the `customer_id` of customers who have spent more than 150 dollars in total.","customer_spending = bakery_1.customer.CALCULATE(

- `institution_count = ...`: This assigns the result of the `CALCULATE` operation to the variable `institution_count`.",institution_count = institutions.CALCULATE(number_of_institutions=COUNT(institutions)),,,0,True,
2678,List the names of institutions in ascending alphabetical order.,SELECT Name FROM institution ORDER BY Name ASC,"1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks for a list of institution names, sorted alphabetically in ascending order. This requires accessing the `institutions` collection, extracting the `name` field, and sorting the results.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
- Start with the `institutions` collection.
- Use `CALCULATE` to select the `name` field, aliasing it as `institution_name`.
- Use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results by `institution_name` in ascending order.

3. **The PyDough code**

The question asks for the customer ids of those customers who have spent more than $150 in total. This requires calculating the total amount spent by each customer and then filtering those customers whose total spending exceeds $150. The total spending is calculated by summing the price of each good in each item in each receipt for a given customer.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the `customer` collection.
   - Calculate the total amount spent by each customer by traversing the relationships to `receipt`, `item`, and `good` and summing the `price` of the `good`.
   - Filter the customers based on the condition that their total spending is greater than 150.
   - Select the `id` of the filtered customers.

The question asks to retrieve the affiliations of institutions that are not located in the city of Vancouver. This requires filtering the `institutions` collection based on the `city` field and then extracting the `affiliation` field.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the `institutions` collection.
   - Filter the collection using the `WHERE` clause to select institutions where the `city` is not equal to ""Vancouver"".
   - Use the `CALCULATE` function to select only the `affiliation` field.

The question asks for the customer ids who spend more than 5 on average for each good. This requires joining the `receipts`, `items`, and `goods` tables to link customers to the goods they purchased and the price of those goods. Then, we need to calculate the average spending per good for each customer and filter for customers whose average spending is greater than 5.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
a. Join `receipts` with `items` on `receiptnumber = receipt` and then join with `goods` on `item = id` to link customers to the goods they purchased and the price of those goods.
b. Calculate the average price per good for each customer.
c. Filter the results to include only customers whose average price per good is greater than 5.
d. Select the customer ids.

).WHERE(avg_spending > 5).CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)

result = customer_avg_spending
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
a. The code starts by navigating from the `receipt` collection to the `item` collection to link customers to the goods they purchased and the price of those goods. The `CALCULATE` function is used to create a new collection with the customer id and the price of each item.
b. The `PARTITION` function groups the data by customer id, allowing us to calculate the average price per good for each customer.
c. The `CALCULATE` function is used again to calculate the average spending per good for each customer.
d. The `WHERE` function filters the results to include only customers whose average spending is greater than 5.
e. Finally, the `CALCULATE` function is used to select the customer ids.","customer_avg_spending = bakery_1.receipt.CALCULATE(

The question asks to identify the dates on which the bakery's total sales exceeded $100. This requires calculating the total sales for each day and then filtering for days where the total sales are greater than $100.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Partition the receipts by date.
b. Calculate the total sales for each day by summing the prices of all items sold on that day. This involves accessing the 'item' sub-collection of 'receipts', then accessing the 'good' sub-collection of 'item' to get the 'price'.
c. Filter the results to include only those days where the total sales are greater than $100.

4. Explanation of how the code works:
The code starts with the `GRAPH` object. The `CALCULATE` function is used to compute the maximum and minimum enrollment across all institutions. The `MAX(institutions.enrollment)` function calculates the maximum enrollment, and the `MIN(institutions.enrollment)` function calculates the minimum enrollment.

2685,Return the maximum and minimum enrollment across all institutions.,"SELECT max(Enrollment) ,  min(Enrollment) FROM institution","1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks for the maximum and minimum enrollment across all institutions. This requires using the `institutions` collection and the `enrollment` field, and then applying the `MAX` and `MIN` aggregation functions within a `CALCULATE` function on the `institutions` collection. The result should be a single row containing the maximum and minimum enrollment values.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
a. Start with the `institutions` collection.

The question asks for a list of institution names that have at least one championship. This requires accessing the `institutions` collection and filtering based on whether they have any associated championships in the `championships` sub-collection.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   - Start with the `institutions` collection.
   - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter institutions that have at least one championship by checking if the `championships` sub-collection `HAS` at least one entry.
   - Use the `CALCULATE` function to select the `name` field of the filtered institutions.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
institutions_with_championships = institutions.WHERE(HAS(championships)==1).CALCULATE(name=name)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `institutions.WHERE(HAS(championships)==1)`: This part filters the `institutions` collection, keeping only those institutions that have at least one entry in the `championships` sub-collection. The `HAS(championships)` function returns true if the institution has at least one championship.
   - `.CALCULATE(name=name)`: This part selects the `name` field from the filtered institutions. The result is a collection containing only the names of institutions with at least one championship.",institutions_with_championships = institutions.WHERE(HAS(championships)==1).CALCULATE(name=name),False,"The generated response is incorrect because it includes institutions that do not have championships listed in the ground truth. Specifically, ""University of British Columbia"", ""University of Calgary"", and ""University of Regina"" are present in the generated response but not in the ground truth. The PyDough code `institutions.WHERE(HAS(championships)==1).CALCULATE(name=name)` is too broad. The `HAS(championships)==1` condition only checks if the `championships` sub-collection exists and has at least one entry, but it doesn't verify if those championships are actually recorded in the `championship` table and associated with the institution. To fix this, the PyDough code needs to incorporate information from the `championship` table to accurately filter institutions that have championships listed there. The current code doesn't establish a link between the `institutions` and the `championship` table to verify the championships.",3,False,

The question asks to count the number of distinct provinces that have institutions. This requires accessing the `institutions` collection and counting the distinct values in the `province` field.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   - Start with the `institutions` collection.
   - Use the `NDISTINCT` function to count the distinct values in the `province` field.
   - Assign the result to a variable.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
distinct_province_count = institutions.CALCULATE(num_provinces=NDISTINCT(province))
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `institutions.CALCULATE(num_provinces=NDISTINCT(province))`: This line starts with the `institutions` collection and uses the `CALCULATE` function to create a new field called `num_provinces`. The value of `num_provinces` is the result of the `NDISTINCT(province)` function, which counts the number of distinct values in the `province` field of the `institutions` collection.
   - `distinct_province_count`: This assigns the result of the query to the variable `distinct_province_count`.",distinct_province_count = institutions.CALCULATE(num_provinces=NDISTINCT(province)),,,0,True,

The question asks to identify provinces that have institutions founded both before 1920 and after 1950. This requires filtering institutions based on their founding year and then identifying provinces that satisfy both conditions. We can achieve this by first identifying the provinces with institutions founded before 1920 and after 1950 separately, and then finding the intersection of these two sets of provinces.

a. Filter institutions founded before 1920 and extract the provinces.
b. Filter institutions founded after 1950 and extract the provinces.
c. Find the intersection of the two sets of provinces.

- Filter universities that have major rankings for both Accounting and Urban Education. This involves using the `HAS` function to check for the existence of major rankings associated with each major.
- Use `CALCULATE` to select the university name.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
accounting_universities = universities.WHERE(
    HAS(major_rankings.WHERE(major.major_name == ""Accounting"")) == 1
)

urban_education_universities = universities.WHERE(
    HAS(major_rankings.WHERE(major.major_name == ""Urban Education"")) == 1
)

result = universities.WHERE(
    (HAS(accounting_universities)==1) & (HAS(urban_education_universities)==1)
).CALCULATE(university_name=university_name)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
- `accounting_universities`: This line filters the `universities` collection to include only those universities that have at least one major ranking associated with the ""Accounting"" major.
- `urban_education_universities`: This line filters the `universities` collection to include only those universities that have at least one major ranking associated with the ""Urban Education"" major.
- `result`: This line filters the `universities` collection to include only those universities that are present in both `accounting_universities` and `urban_education_universities`. It then uses `CALCULATE` to select the `university_name` for the resulting universities.","accounting_universities = universities.WHERE(
    HAS(major_rankings.WHERE(major.major_name == ""Accounting"")) == 1
)

urban_education_universities = universities.WHERE(

The question asks for the university name and overall ranking of universities located in the state of Wisconsin. This requires joining the `universities` and `overall_rankings` collections based on `university_id` and filtering by the `state` field in the `universities` collection.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
    - Start with the `universities` collection.
    - Filter the `universities` collection to include only those located in Wisconsin (`state == ""Wisconsin""`).
    - Join the filtered `universities` collection with the `overall_rankings` collection using the `university_id` to access the ranking information.
    - Use `CALCULATE` to select the `university_name` from the `universities` collection and the `rank` from the `overall_rankings` collection.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block:**
```python
wisconsin_universities = universities.WHERE(state == ""Wisconsin"").CALCULATE(
    university_name=university_name, 
    rank=overall_rankings.rank
)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
    - `universities.WHERE(state == ""Wisconsin"")`: This filters the `universities` collection, keeping only the universities where the `state` field is equal to ""Wisconsin"".
    - `.CALCULATE(university_name=university_name, rank=overall_rankings.rank)`: This selects the `university_name` from the `universities` collection and the `rank` from the related `overall_rankings` collection for the filtered universities. The result is a new collection containing only the university name and rank for universities in Wisconsin.","wisconsin_universities = universities.WHERE(state == ""Wisconsin"").CALCULATE(
    university_name=university_name, 
    rank=overall_rankings.rank
)",False,"The generated response is incorrect. The PyDough code is missing the join operation between the `universities` and `overall_rankings` collections. The `CALCULATE` function is used incorrectly, as it attempts to access `overall_rankings.rank` without establishing a relationship between the two collections. To fix this, a `JOIN` operation should be used to combine the collections based on `university_id` before applying the `CALCULATE` function to select the desired fields. The current code only filters the `universities` collection and attempts to calculate the rank without linking it to the `overall_rankings` collection.",3,False,

The question asks for the name and citation point of the universities with the top 3 reputation points. This requires accessing the `overall_rankings` and `universities` collections, joining them, and then selecting the top 3 universities based on their reputation points.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
- Start with the `overall_rankings` collection.
- Join `universities` collection using the `university_id`.
- Select the `university_name` from `universities` and `citation_point` from `overall_rankings`.
- Use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 universities based on `reputation_point` in descending order.

3. **The PyDough code:**
```python
top_universities = overall_rankings.CALCULATE(
    university_name=university.university_name, 
    citation_point=citation_point,
    reputation_point=reputation_point
).TOP_K(3, by=reputation_point.DESC()).CALCULATE(university_name=university_name, citation_point=citation_point)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
- The code starts with the `overall_rankings` collection.
- It uses `CALCULATE` to create a new collection with `university_name` (obtained from the joined `universities` collection), `citation_point`, and `reputation_point`.
- It then uses `TOP_K` to select the top 3 universities based on the `reputation_point` in descending order.
- Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` again to select only the `university_name` and `citation_point` for the final result.","top_universities = overall_rankings.CALCULATE(

The question asks to identify states that have more than two universities with enrollment smaller than 3000. This requires filtering universities based on enrollment, grouping them by state, and then counting the number of universities in each state that meet the enrollment criteria. Finally, we need to filter the states to include only those with a count greater than two.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
a. Filter universities with enrollment smaller than 3000.
b. Partition the filtered universities by state.
c. Calculate the number of universities in each state that meet the enrollment criteria.

3010,What are the names of the publishers that made more than 15 billion profits each year or 1 billion each month?,SELECT name FROM press WHERE Year_Profits_billion  >  15 OR Month_Profits_billion  >  1,"```text
1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the names of publishers (presses) that satisfy either of two conditions: their yearly profits exceed 15 billion, or their monthly profits exceed 1 billion. The database schema contains a 'presses' collection with 'year_profits_billion' and 'month_profits_billion' fields.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Filter the 'presses' collection to include only those presses where 'year_profits_billion' is greater than 15 or 'month_profits_billion' is greater than 1.
b. Extract the 'name' of the filtered presses.

3. The PyDough code:
```python
profitable_presses = book_press.presses.WHERE((year_profits_billion > 15) | (month_profits_billion > 1)).CALCULATE(press_name=name)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `book_press.presses.WHERE((year_profits_billion > 15) | (month_profits_billion > 1))`: This part filters the 'presses' collection. The `WHERE` clause specifies the condition: either the 'year_profits_billion' is greater than 15 or the 'month_profits_billion' is greater than 1.
b. `.CALCULATE(press_name=name)`: This part selects the 'name' field from the filtered presses and renames it to 'press_name'. The result is a collection containing only the names of the presses that meet the specified profit criteria.

The question asks for the average and maximum year profits for all presses. This requires calculating the average and maximum of the `year_profits_billion` field in the `presses` collection.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
We can directly use the `AVG` and `MAX` aggregation functions on the `year_profits_billion` field of the `presses` collection within a `CALCULATE` expression. The result is a single row with the average and maximum year profits.

The question asks to identify authors who have published books in both the ""MM"" and ""LT"" series. This requires filtering the `books` collection based on the `book_series` field and then identifying the authors associated with those books. We need to find authors who have at least one book in each of the specified series and return their names.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Filter the `books` collection to find books in the ""MM"" series and extract the `author_id`.
   - Filter the `books` collection to find books in the ""LT"" series and extract the `author_id`.
   - Find the intersection of the two sets of `author_id`s.
   - Retrieve the author names corresponding to the intersected `author_id`s from the `authors` collection.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to find the name and yearly profit for presses that have published more than two books. This requires filtering presses based on the number of books they have published and then selecting the name and yearly profit of those presses.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, filter the presses that have published more than two books using the WHERE clause and the COUNT aggregation function on the books sub-collection. Then, use the CALCULATE function to select the name and year_profits_billion fields.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
presses_filtered = book_press.presses.WHERE(COUNT(books) > 2).CALCULATE(name=name, year_profits_billion=year_profits_billion)

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first filters the `book_press.presses` collection to include only those presses that have published more than two books. This is done using the `WHERE` clause and the `COUNT(books)` aggregation function. The `CALCULATE` function then selects the `name` and `year_profits_billion` fields for the filtered presses, renaming `name` to `name` and `year_profits_billion` to `year_profits_billion`. The result is assigned to the variable `presses_filtered`.","presses_filtered = book_press.presses.WHERE(COUNT(books) > 2).CALCULATE(name=name, year_profits_billion=year_profits_billion)",,,0,True,

The question asks for the top 3 best-selling books, along with their titles, author names, and press names. This requires accessing the `books` collection, sorting by `sale_amount` in descending order, and retrieving related information from the `authors` and `presses` collections using joins.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
    - Start with the `books` collection.
    - Use `CALCULATE` to select the `title` and access the related `author` and `pres` collections to get the `name` of the author and the press.
    - Use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 books based on `sale_amount` in descending order.

The question asks to retrieve the name of each press and the total sale amount of books associated with that press. This requires joining the `presses` and `books` collections, grouping by press name, and summing the `sale_amount` for each press.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
- Start with the `presses` collection.
- Use `CALCULATE` to create a new field `total_sale_amount` that sums the `sale_amount` of all books associated with each press. Also, select the `name` of the press and assign it to `press_name`.

- `press_name=name`: This selects the `name` field from the `presses` collection and assigns it to a new field called `press_name`.
- `total_sale_amount=SUM(books.sale_amount)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_amount` field from the `books` sub-collection for each press and assigns it to a new field called `total_sale_amount`. The `SUM` function aggregates the `sale_amount` values for all books related to each press.
- The final result `press_sales` will be a collection containing the `press_name` and `total_sale_amount` for each press.","press_sales = presses.CALCULATE(

The question asks to count the number of staff members who have not attended any meetings. This requires identifying staff members with no entries in the `staff_in_meeting` table.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the `staffs` collection.
   - Use `WHERE` and `HASNOT` to filter for staff members who do not have any related entries in the `staff_in_meeting` collection.
   - Use `CALCULATE` with `COUNT` to count the number of staff members that meet the criteria.
   - Assign the result to a variable.

3177,Return the ids and details of staff who have attended at least 1 meeting and have an s in their staff details?,"SELECT staff_id ,  staff_details FROM staff WHERE staff_details LIKE ""%s%"" GROUP BY staff_id HAVING count(*)  >=  1","1. Analysis of the question
The question asks for the `staff_id` and `staff_details` of staff members who have attended at least one meeting and whose `staff_details` contain the letter 's'. This requires filtering the `staffs` collection based on two conditions: the staff member must have attended at least one meeting (indicated by the existence of a related record in the `staff_in_meeting` collection), and their `staff_details` must contain the letter 's'.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, start with the `staffs` collection.
Then, filter the `staffs` collection to include only those staff members who have attended at least one meeting by checking for the existence of related records in the `staff_in_meeting` collection using `HAS(staff_in_meeting)`.
Next, filter the resulting collection further to include only those staff members whose `staff_details` contain the letter 's' using the `CONTAINS` function.
Finally, use the `CALCULATE` function to select the `staff_id` and `staff_details` fields for the output.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
staff_with_meetings_and_s = staffs.WHERE(HAS(staff_in_meeting)==1).WHERE(CONTAINS(staff_details, 's')).CALCULATE(staff_id=staff_id, staff_details=staff_details)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code starts with the `staffs` collection. The first `WHERE` clause filters the collection to include only staff members who have at least one entry in the `staff_in_meeting` collection, indicating that they have attended at least one meeting. The second `WHERE` clause further filters the collection to include only those staff members whose `staff_details` field contains the letter 's'. Finally, the `CALCULATE` function selects the `staff_id` and `staff_details` fields for the output, renaming them to `staff_id` and `staff_details` respectively.

The question asks to retrieve all distinct invoice IDs and their corresponding statuses. This requires accessing the `invoice_id` from the `payment` collection and `invoice_status` from the `invoice` collection, joining the `payment` and `invoice` collections, and selecting the distinct combinations of these two fields.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   - Start with the `payment` collection.
   - Join with the `invoice` collection using the `invoice` relationship.
   - Use `CALCULATE` to select the `invoice_id` and `invoice_status` fields.
   - Use `PARTITION` to group by `invoice_id` and `invoice_status` to get distinct combinations.
   - Use `CALCULATE` again to select the `invoice_id` and `invoice_status` fields from the partitioned data.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
distinct_invoices = advertising_agencies.payment.CALCULATE(invoice_id=invoice.invoice_id).invoice.PARTITION(name=""distinct_invoice"", by=(invoice_id, invoice_status)).CALCULATE(invoice_id=invoice_id, invoice_status=invoice_status)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `advertising_agencies.payment.CALCULATE(invoice_id=invoice.invoice_id)`: This part starts with the `payment` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to create a new collection with the `invoice_id` from the related `invoice` collection.
   - `.invoice.PARTITION(name=""distinct_invoice"", by=(invoice_id, invoice_status))`: This partitions the collection by `invoice_id` and `invoice_status`, effectively grouping the payments by these two attributes. This step ensures that we only have distinct combinations of `invoice_id` and `invoice_status`.
   - `.CALCULATE(invoice_id=invoice_id, invoice_status=invoice_status)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects the `invoice_id` and `invoice_status` from the partitioned data, providing the desired output of distinct invoice IDs and their statuses.","distinct_invoices = advertising_agencies.payment.CALCULATE(invoice_id=invoice.invoice_id).invoice.PARTITION(name=""distinct_invoice"", by=(invoice_id, invoice_status)).CALCULATE(invoice_id=invoice_id, invoice_status=invoice_status)",False,The generated response is incorrect. The PyDough code produces an empty DataFrame instead of the expected invoice IDs and statuses. The code incorrectly starts with the `payment` collection and doesn't properly utilize the `invoice` relationship to join or access the `invoice` collection.

The question asks for the `staff_id` and `staff_details` of staff members who have attended at least one meeting and whose `staff_details` contain the letter 's'. This requires filtering the `staffs` collection based on two conditions: the staff member must be associated with at least one meeting (checked via the `staff_in_meeting` sub-collection), and their `staff_details` must contain the letter 's'. To ensure that we are only considering staff members who have attended at least one meeting, we will group by `staff_id` and filter using `HAS(staff_in_meeting)`.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   - Start with the `staffs` collection.
   - Filter the `staffs` collection to include only those staff members who have at least one entry in the `staff_in_meeting` sub-collection using `HAS(staff_in_meeting) == 1`.
   - Further filter the collection to include only those staff members whose `staff_details` contain the letter 's' using `CONTAINS(staff_details, 's')`.

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `staffs.WHERE(HAS(staff_in_meeting) == 1)`: This filters the `staffs` collection, keeping only those staff members who are associated with at least one meeting. The `HAS(staff_in_meeting)` function returns `True` if a staff member has one or more entries in the `staff_in_meeting` sub-collection, and `False` otherwise.

3330,which state has the longest river,SELECT traverse FROM river WHERE LENGTH  =  ( SELECT MAX ( LENGTH ) FROM river );,"1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks to find the state that has the longest river. This requires joining the `rivers` and `states` collections, grouping by state, and finding the maximum river length for each state.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
- Start with the `rivers` collection.
- Join with the `states` collection using the `traverse` field in `rivers` and the `state_name` field in `states`.
- Partition the data by state.
- Calculate the maximum river length for each state.
- Find the state with the maximum river length across all states.

3. **The PyDough code**
```python
river_info = geo.rivers.CALCULATE(
    river_name=river_name,
    length=length,
    traverse=traverse
)

)

longest_river_state = state_river_lengths.TOP_K(1, by=max_river_length.DESC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
- The code first calculates the river information, selecting the river name, length, and the state it traverses.
- Then, it partitions the data by the state the river traverses.
- Within each state partition, it calculates the maximum river length.
- Finally, it selects the state with the longest river using `TOP_K`.","river_info = geo.rivers.CALCULATE(

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to find the state that contains the city with the highest population. This requires finding the maximum population among all cities and then identifying the state to which that city belongs.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, find the city with the maximum population. Then, find the state associated with that city.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
most_populous_city = geo.cities.ORDER_BY(population.DESC()).TOP_K(1, by=population.DESC()).CALCULATE(city_name=city_name, state_name=state_name)
result = geo.states.WHERE(state_name == most_populous_city.SINGULAR().state_name).CALCULATE(state_name=state_name)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first finds the city with the highest population using `ORDER_BY` and `TOP_K`. Then, it filters the `geo.states` collection to find the state that matches the `state_name` of the most populous city. Finally, it calculates the `state_name` of the matching state.
```","most_populous_city = geo.cities.ORDER_BY(population.DESC()).TOP_K(1, by=population.DESC()).CALCULATE(city_name=city_name, state_name=state_name)

3353,which state has the largest city,SELECT state_name FROM city WHERE population  =  ( SELECT MAX ( population ) FROM city );,"1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks to identify the state with the largest city (highest population). This requires finding the city with the maximum population within each state and then identifying the state associated with that city.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - First, we need to find the largest city within each state. We can achieve this by partitioning the `cities` collection by `state_name` and then finding the maximum population within each partition.
   - Then, we need to find the state that contains the city with the largest population.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block:**
```python
largest_city_per_state = geo.cities.PARTITION(name=""city_by_state"", by=(state_name)).CALCULATE(

)

state_with_largest_city = largest_city_per_state.ORDER_BY(largest_city_population.DESC()).TOP_K(1, by=largest_city_population.DESC()).CALCULATE(state_name=state_name)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - The `geo.cities.PARTITION(name=""city_by_state"", by=(state_name)).CALCULATE(...)` part groups the cities by state and calculates the maximum population for each state using the `MAX(population)` aggregation function. The result is a collection where each record represents a state and its largest city's population.
   - The `largest_city_per_state.ORDER_BY(largest_city_population.DESC()).TOP_K(1, by=largest_city_population.DESC()).CALCULATE(state_name=state_name)` part orders the states by the largest city population in descending order and selects the top 1 state, effectively identifying the state with the overall largest city.

The question asks for the highest point in states that border Colorado. This requires joining the `states` and `border_infos` collections, filtering for states that border Colorado, and then finding the maximum `highest_point` among those states using the `highlows` collection.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
    - Filter the `border_infos` collection to find states that border Colorado (`state_name` = 'Colorado').
    - Access the `border` attribute of the filtered `border_infos` collection to get the names of the bordering states.
    - Filter the `states` collection to include only the bordering states obtained in the previous step.
