## Example 1

### Question
```
Provide a summary pricing report for all line items shipped as of September 2nd of 1998. The summary should list totals for extended price, discounted extended price, discounted extended price plus tax, average quantity, average extended price, average discount, and number of lines, all broken down by the return flag & line status. This is also known as TPC-H query #1.
```

# Pydough Code Explanation: TPC-H Query #1

I'll explain the provided Pydough code that answers the original question about creating a summary pricing report for line items shipped as of September 2nd, 1998.

## 1. Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns

The code uses several key Pydough functions and patterns:

### Contextless Expressions
```python
disc_price = l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)
charge = disc_price * (1 + l.tax)
```
These are contextless expressions that define calculations to be used later in the query [86f2714].

### Data Filtering with WHERE
```python
selected_lines = lines.WHERE((ship_date <= datetime.date(1998, 9, 2)))
```
The WHERE function filters the dataset to include only records meeting the specified condition [86f2714].

### Partitioning with PARTITION
```python
partitioned_lines = PARTITION(selected_lines, name="l", by=(return_flag, status))
```
PARTITION groups the filtered data by return flag and line status [86f2714].

### Aggregation Functions
The code uses several aggregation functions:
- `SUM()` - Calculates the sum of values
- `AVG()` - Calculates the average of values
- `COUNT()` - Counts the number of records [86f2714]

### Sorting with ORDER_BY
```python
.ORDER_BY(return_flag.ASC(), status.ASC())
```
This sorts the results by return flag and status in ascending order [86f2714].

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The data flow in this query follows these steps:

1. **Define Calculations**: First, the code defines two calculations - discounted price and charge [86f2714].
2. **Filter Data**: It filters the line items to include only those shipped by September 2nd, 1998 [86f2714].
3. **Group Data**: The filtered data is then grouped by return flag and line status [86f2714].
4. **Calculate Aggregations**: For each group, it calculates various aggregations including sums, averages, and counts [86f2714].
5. **Sort Results**: Finally, it sorts the results by return flag and line status [86f2714].

## 3. Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several Pydough best practices:

1. **Reusable Expressions**: It defines calculations like `disc_price` and `charge` once and reuses them [86f2714].
2. **Logical Flow**: The code follows a logical flow from filtering to grouping to aggregation to sorting [86f2714].
3. **Naming Convention**: It uses clear variable names like `selected_lines` and `partitioned_lines` [86f2714].
4. **Explicit Naming**: The output columns are explicitly named (e.g., `L_RETURNFLAG`, `SUM_QTY`) [86f2714].

## 4. Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions:

1. **Method Chaining**: It uses method chaining for the final calculation and sorting [86f2714].
2. **Naming Context**: It provides a name ("l") for the partitioned context [86f2714].
3. **Column References**: It uses the context name to reference columns (e.g., `l.quantity`, `l.extended_price`) [86f2714].
4. **Capitalized Functions**: Pydough functions like WHERE, PARTITION, SUM, AVG, COUNT, and ORDER_BY are capitalized [86f2714].

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the original question by:

1. Filtering line items shipped as of September 2nd, 1998 [86f2714].
2. Breaking down the results by return flag and line status [86f2714].
3. Calculating all requested metrics:
   - Totals for extended price (`SUM_BASE_PRICE`)
   - Discounted extended price (`SUM_DISC_PRICE`)
   - Discounted extended price plus tax (`SUM_CHARGE`)
   - Average quantity (`AVG_QTY`)
   - Average extended price (`AVG_PRICE`)
   - Average discount (`AVG_DISC`)
   - Number of lines (`COUNT_ORDER`) [86f2714]

## 6. Key Examples from Search Results

The provided code is almost identical to the example in the search results:

```python
%%pydough

disc_price = l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)
charge = disc_price * (1 + l.tax)
selected_lines = lines.WHERE((ship_date <= datetime.date(1998, 9, 2)))
partitioned_lines = PARTITION(selected_lines, name="l", by=(return_flag, status))
output = partitioned_lines.CALCULATE(
 L_RETURNFLAG=return_flag,
 L_LINESTATUS=status,
 SUM_QTY=SUM(l.quantity),
 SUM_BASE_PRICE=SUM(l.extended_price),
 SUM_DISC_PRICE=SUM(disc_price),
 SUM_CHARGE=SUM(charge),
 AVG_QTY=AVG(l.quantity),
 AVG_PRICE=AVG(l.extended_price),
 AVG_DISC=AVG(l.discount),
 COUNT_ORDER=COUNT(l),
).ORDER_BY(return_flag.ASC(), status.ASC())
pydough.to_df(output)
```
[86f2714]

The only difference is that in the search result, the final calculation uses `CALCULATE()` and assigns the result to `output`, while the provided code uses function call syntax and assigns to `result`.

## 7. Comparison to SQL

The Pydough code is a more readable and maintainable alternative to the equivalent SQL query:

```SQL
select
	l_returnflag,
	l_linestatus,
	sum(l_quantity) as sum_qty,
	sum(l_extendedprice) as sum_base_price,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as sum_disc_price,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) as sum_charge,
	avg(l_quantity) as avg_qty,
	avg(l_extendedprice) as avg_price,
	avg(l_discount) as avg_disc,
	count(*) as count_order
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '90' day
group by
	l_returnflag,
	l_linestatus
order by
	l_returnflag,
	l_linestatus
```
[86f2714]

The Pydough version makes the calculations more explicit and reusable, improving readability.

## Example 2

### Question
```
Find, within the European region, for each brass part of size 15, the supplier who can supply it at minimum cost. If several suppliers in that region offer the desired part type and size at the same (minimum) cost, list the parts from suppliers with the 100 highest account balances. List the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information. This is also known as TPC-H query #2.
```

### Pydough Code
```python
selected_parts = (
    nations.WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")
    .suppliers.supply_records.part(
        s_acctbal=BACK(2).account_balance,
        s_name=BACK(2).name,
        n_name=BACK(3).name,
        s_address=BACK(2).address,
        s_phone=BACK(2).phone,
        s_comment=BACK(2).comment,
        supplycost=BACK(1).supplycost,
    )
    .WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
)
part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key)(
    best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
)
result = part_groups.p.WHERE(
    (supplycost == BACK(1).best_cost)
    & ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS")
    & (size == 15)
)(
    S_ACCTBAL=s_acctbal,
    S_NAME=s_name,
    N_NAME=n_name,
    P_PARTKEY=key,
    P_MFGR=manufacturer,
    S_ADDRESS=s_address,
    S_PHONE=s_phone,
    S_COMMENT=s_comment,
).TOP_K(
    100,
    by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
)
```

# Explanation of Pydough Code for TPC-H Query #2

I'll explain the provided Pydough code that answers the question about finding suppliers in the European region who can supply brass parts of size 15 at minimum cost, with specific sorting and filtering requirements.

## 1. Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### BACK Function
The `BACK` function is used to reference entities from previous steps in the data flow. For example:
- `BACK(1)` refers to the immediately preceding entity
- `BACK(2)` refers to the entity two steps back
- `BACK(3)` refers to the entity three steps back

In the code, we see this pattern used to access attributes from previous entities:
```python
s_acctbal=BACK(2).account_balance,
s_name=BACK(2).name,
n_name=BACK(3).name,
s_address=BACK(2).address,
s_phone=BACK(2).phone,
s_comment=BACK(2).comment,
supplycost=BACK(1).supplycost,
```

### PARTITION Function
The `PARTITION` function [45c4498] is used to group collections under specific keys, similar to SQL's `GROUP BY`. In this code:
```python
part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key)(
    best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
)
```
This partitions the `selected_parts` by their `key` attribute, giving the partition the name "p", and calculates the minimum supply cost for each partition.

### TOP_K Function
The `TOP_K` function [45c4498] is used to limit the result set to a specific number of rows, ordered by specified criteria:
```python
.TOP_K(
    100,
    by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
)
```
This returns the top 100 results ordered by account balance (descending), nation name (ascending), supplier name (ascending), and part key (ascending).

### WHERE Function
The `WHERE` function is used for filtering data based on conditions:
```python
.WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
```
This filters for parts whose type ends with "BRASS" and have a size of 15.

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows these steps:

1. **Initial Selection**: Start with nations in the European region
   ```python
   nations.WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")
   ```

2. **Navigation and Attribute Collection**: Navigate through suppliers, supply records, and parts, collecting relevant attributes
   ```python
   .suppliers.supply_records.part(
       s_acctbal=BACK(2).account_balance,
       s_name=BACK(2).name,
       n_name=BACK(3).name,
       s_address=BACK(2).address,
       s_phone=BACK(2).phone,
       s_comment=BACK(2).comment,
       supplycost=BACK(1).supplycost,
   )
   ```

3. **Filtering Parts**: Filter for brass parts of size 15
   ```python
   .WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
   ```

4. **Partitioning and Finding Minimum Cost**: Group by part key and find the minimum supply cost for each part
   ```python
   part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key)(
       best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
   )
   ```

5. **Final Selection and Formatting**: Select parts with the minimum cost, format the output, and sort appropriately
   ```python
   result = part_groups.p.WHERE(
       (supplycost == BACK(1).best_cost)
       & ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS")
       & (size == 15)
   )(
       S_ACCTBAL=s_acctbal,
       S_NAME=s_name,
       N_NAME=n_name,
       P_PARTKEY=key,
       P_MFGR=manufacturer,
       S_ADDRESS=s_address,
       S_PHONE=s_phone,
       S_COMMENT=s_comment,
   ).TOP_K(
       100,
       by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
   )
   ```

## 3. Important Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Chaining Operations**: The code demonstrates chaining multiple operations together for a clean, readable flow [82a3091].

2. **Using BACK References**: The code properly uses `BACK` references to access attributes from previous steps in the data flow.

3. **Partitioning for Aggregation**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group data before applying the `MIN` aggregation function [45c4498].

4. **Clear Variable Naming**: Variables like `selected_parts` and `part_groups` clearly indicate their purpose.

## 4. How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

1. **Naming Convention**: The code uses snake_case for variable names (`selected_parts`, `part_groups`) and uppercase for output column names (`S_ACCTBAL`, `P_PARTKEY`).

2. **Chaining Pattern**: The code follows the Pydough pattern of chaining operations with dot notation.

3. **Sorting Specification**: The code correctly specifies sorting direction using `.ASC()` and `.DESC()` methods [45c4498].

4. **Partitioning Pattern**: The code follows the convention of naming the partition and specifying the grouping key [45c4498].

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the requirements of TPC-H query #2 [82a3091]:

1. It filters for nations in the European region: `nations.WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")`

2. It selects brass parts of size 15: `.WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))`

3. It finds the minimum supply cost for each part: `best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)`

4. It selects suppliers offering parts at the minimum cost: `(supplycost == BACK(1).best_cost)`

5. It sorts by account balance (descending) and other criteria: `by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC())`

6. It limits to the top 100 results: `.TOP_K(100, ...)`

7. It includes all required attributes in the output: supplier's account balance, name, nation; part's number and manufacturer; supplier's address, phone, and comment.

The implementation in the code matches the description in [82a3091], which states that this query "finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can supply it at minimum cost."

## 6. Key Examples from the Search

The implementation is similar to the example in [82a3091], which shows a similar approach for TPC-H query #2:

```python
selected_parts = (
 nations.CALCULATE(n_name=name)
 .WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")
 .suppliers.CALCULATE(
   s_acctbal=account_balance,
   s_name=name,
   s_address=address,
   s_phone=phone,
   s_comment=comment,
 )
 .supply_records.CALCULATE(
   supplycost=supplycost,
 )
 .part.WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
 )
```

The main difference is that the example uses `CALCULATE` to create new attributes, while the provided code uses a more direct approach with the `part()` method and `BACK` references.

In conclusion, the provided Pydough code efficiently implements TPC-H query #2, following Pydough conventions and best practices to find suppliers in the European region who can supply brass parts of size 15 at minimum cost, with appropriate sorting and filtering.

## Example 3

### Question
```
Find the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value. Retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of the extended price times one minus the discount, of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of March 15th, 1995. orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist meeting the criteria, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed. This is also known as TPC-H query #3.
```

### Pydough Code
```python
cutoff_date = datetime.date(1995, 3, 15)
selected_orders = orders.WHERE(
    (customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING") & (order_date < cutoff_date)
)
selected_lines = selected_orders.lines.WHERE(ship_date > cutoff_date)(
    BACK(1).order_date,

# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding Top 10 Unshipped Orders

## Overview

The provided Pydough code implements TPC-H query #3, which finds the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value as of March 15th, 1995. Let me explain the code in detail based on the provided documentation.

## Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns

### 1. WHERE Function
The code uses the `WHERE` function to filter data based on specific conditions:

```python
selected_orders = orders.WHERE(
    (customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING") & (order_date < cutoff_date)
)
```

This pattern is seen in multiple examples in the documentation [82a3091], where `WHERE` is used to filter collections based on boolean conditions.

### 2. PARTITION Function
The `PARTITION` function is used to group data by specific keys and perform aggregations:

```python
result = PARTITION(
    selected_lines, name="l", by=(order_key, order_date, ship_priority)
)(
    L_ORDERKEY=order_key,
    REVENUE=SUM(l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)),
    O_ORDERDATE=order_date,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY=ship_priority,
)
```

This is similar to the pattern shown in [407f517] where `PARTITION` is used to group customer information by the number of non-special orders:

```python
output = PARTITION(customer_info, name="custs", by=num_non_special_orders).CALCULATE(
    C_COUNT=num_non_special_orders, CUSTDIST=COUNT(custs)
)
```

### 3. TOP_K Function
The `TOP_K` function is used to limit results to the top K items based on specified ordering:

```python
.TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))
```

This pattern is demonstrated in [82a3091] where `TOP_K` is used to get the top 100 results:

```python
.TOP_K(
    100,
    by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
)
```

### 4. BACK Function
The `BACK` function is used to reference parent collections in the data hierarchy:

```python
selected_lines = selected_orders.lines.WHERE(ship_date > cutoff_date)(
    BACK(1).order_date,
    BACK(1).ship_priority,
)
```

According to [e676197], `BACK` is used to reference previous items in a sequence, such as in time-series data.

### 5. Aggregation Functions (SUM)
The code uses the `SUM` aggregation function to calculate the total revenue:

```python
REVENUE=SUM(l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount))
```

This pattern is seen in [82a3091] where `SUM` is used to calculate various aggregations.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow:

1. **Define a cutoff date**: `cutoff_date = datetime.date(1995, 3, 15)`

2. **Filter orders**: Select orders from the "BUILDING" market segment that were placed before the cutoff date [82a3091]:
   ```python
   selected_orders = orders.WHERE(
       (customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING") & (order_date < cutoff_date)
   )
   ```

3. **Filter line items**: From the selected orders, get line items that haven't shipped yet (ship date after cutoff date) and include order date and shipping priority from the parent order [82a3091]:
   ```python
   selected_lines = selected_orders.lines.WHERE(ship_date > cutoff_date)(
       BACK(1).order_date,
       BACK(1).ship_priority,
   )
   ```

4. **Group and aggregate**: Group the selected line items by order key, order date, and shipping priority, then calculate the revenue for each group [82a3091]:
   ```python
   result = PARTITION(
       selected_lines, name="l", by=(order_key, order_date, ship_priority)
   )(
       L_ORDERKEY=order_key,
       REVENUE=SUM(l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)),
       O_ORDERDATE=order_date,
       O_SHIPPRIORITY=ship_priority,
   )
   ```

5. **Sort and limit**: Get the top 10 orders with the highest revenue, breaking ties by order date (ascending) and then order key (ascending) [82a3091]:
   ```python
   .TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))
   ```

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Clear variable naming**: Variables like `cutoff_date`, `selected_orders`, and `selected_lines` clearly indicate their purpose [82a3091].

2. **Progressive data refinement**: The code starts with all orders and progressively filters and transforms the data [82a3091].

3. **Efficient use of relationships**: The code leverages the relationship between orders and line items using the `.lines` accessor [82a3091].

4. **Proper use of BACK**: The code uses `BACK(1)` to reference parent collections when needed [e676197].

5. **Appropriate sorting**: The code uses multiple sorting criteria to ensure deterministic results [82a3091].

## How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

1. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations like `WHERE`, `PARTITION`, and `TOP_K` to create a readable data pipeline [82a3091].

2. **Using parentheses for method arguments**: The code uses parentheses to pass arguments to methods [82a3091].

3. **Using aliases in PARTITION**: The code assigns a name (`"l"`) to the partitioned elements for reference in aggregations [407f517].

4. **Using descriptive column names**: The output columns are named according to the TPC-H specification (L_ORDERKEY, REVENUE, etc.) [82a3091].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the requirements of TPC-H query #3:

1. It filters orders to those from the "BUILDING" market segment placed before March 15th, 1995 [82a3091].

2. It identifies line items that haven't shipped yet (ship date after March 15th, 1995) [82a3091].

3. It calculates the potential revenue for each order as the sum of extended price times (1 - discount) [82a3091].

4. It returns the top 10 orders with the highest revenue, sorted by revenue (descending), order date (ascending), and order key (ascending) [82a3091].

5. For each order, it includes the order key, revenue, order date, and shipping priority [82a3091].

## Comparison with SQL

The Pydough code is equivalent to the SQL query shown in [82a3091]:

```sql
SELECT
  L_ORDERKEY,
  SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE,
  O_ORDERDATE,
  O_SHIPPRIORITY
FROM
  CUSTOMER,
  ORDERS,
  LINEITEM
WHERE
  C_MKTSEGMENT = 'BUILDING'
  AND C_CUSTKEY = O_CUSTKEY
  AND L_ORDERKEY = O_ORDERKEY
  AND O_ORDERDATE < DATE '1995-03-15'
  AND L_SHIPDATE > DATE '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
  L_ORDERKEY,
  O_ORDERDATE,
  O_SHIPPRIORITY
ORDER BY
  REVENUE DESC,
  O_ORDERDATE
LIMIT 10;
```

The Pydough code achieves the same result with a more readable and concise syntax, leveraging the relationships between entities in the data model.
