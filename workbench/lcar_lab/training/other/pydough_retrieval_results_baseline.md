# Explanation of Pydough Code for TPC-H Query #1

## Overview

The provided Pydough code implements TPC-H Query #1, which generates a summary pricing report for line items shipped by a certain date. The code demonstrates several key Pydough patterns and functions to filter, partition, aggregate, and sort data.

## Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns

### 1. Contextless Expressions
The code begins by defining contextless expressions that will be used later:
```python
disc_price = l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)
charge = disc_price * (1 + l.tax)
```
These expressions define calculations without being tied to a specific context yet [1edfda2]. This allows for reuse in different contexts and makes testing easier.

### 2. Filtering with WHERE
```python
selected_lines = lines.WHERE((ship_date <= datetime.date(1998, 9, 2)))
```
The `WHERE` function filters the dataset to include only line items shipped on or before September 2, 1998 [86f2714].

### 3. Partitioning with PARTITION
```python
partitioned_lines = PARTITION(selected_lines, name="l", by=(return_flag, status))
```
The `PARTITION` function groups the filtered line items by return flag and line status [86f2714]. This creates logical groups for aggregation.

### 4. Aggregation Functions
The code uses several aggregation functions:
- `SUM()` - Calculates the sum of values
- `AVG()` - Calculates the average of values
- `COUNT()` - Counts the number of items

### 5. Sorting with ORDER_BY
```python
.ORDER_BY(return_flag.ASC(), status.ASC())
```
The `ORDER_BY` function sorts the results by return flag and line status in ascending order [86f2714].

## Data Flow and Transformations

1. **Define Calculations**: First, the code defines the discounted price and charge calculations [86f2714].
2. **Filter Data**: It filters line items to include only those shipped by the specified date [86f2714].
3. **Partition Data**: The filtered data is partitioned by return flag and line status [86f2714].
4. **Aggregate Data**: For each partition, various aggregations are calculated [86f2714].
5. **Sort Results**: Finally, the results are sorted by return flag and line status [86f2714].

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Contextless Expressions**: Defining calculations separately from their application context improves reusability [1edfda2].
2. **Composability**: The code builds the query step by step, making it easy to understand and modify [c61fd59].
3. **Semantic Clarity**: The code clearly expresses the business logic without getting bogged down in implementation details [86f2714].
4. **Avoiding Redundancy**: The code defines calculations once and reuses them, avoiding redundancy [c61fd59].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Function Naming**: Uses uppercase for PyDough operations like `WHERE`, `PARTITION`, and `ORDER_BY` [86f2714].
2. **Method Chaining**: Operations are chained together in a readable sequence [86f2714].
3. **Named Parameters**: Uses named parameters in the calculation to clearly indicate what each value represents [86f2714].
4. **Contextual Binding**: Variables like `l` are bound to a specific context through the `name` parameter in `PARTITION` [86f2714].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the requirements by:

1. Filtering line items shipped as of September 2, 1998 [86f2714].
2. Breaking down results by return flag and line status [86f2714].
3. Calculating all required metrics:
   - Sum of quantity (`SUM_QTY`)
   - Sum of extended price (`SUM_BASE_PRICE`)
   - Sum of discounted extended price (`SUM_DISC_PRICE`)
   - Sum of discounted extended price plus tax (`SUM_CHARGE`)
   - Average quantity (`AVG_QTY`)
   - Average extended price (`AVG_PRICE`)
   - Average discount (`AVG_DISC`)
   - Count of line items (`COUNT_ORDER`) [86f2714]
4. Sorting results by return flag and line status [86f2714].

## Key Code Block Comparison

The original SQL query from the TPC-H benchmark [86f2714]:

```SQL
select
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus,
    sum(l_quantity) as sum_qty,
    sum(l_extendedprice) as sum_base_price,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as sum_disc_price,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) as sum_charge,
    avg(l_quantity) as avg_qty,
    avg(l_extendedprice) as avg_price,
    avg(l_discount) as avg_disc,
    count(*) as count_order
from
    lineitem
where
    l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '90' day
group by
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus
order by
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus
```

The PyDough implementation is more concise and readable, with clearer separation of concerns between filtering, partitioning, aggregation, and sorting.

## Conclusion

This PyDough code demonstrates how to implement TPC-H Query #1 in a clear, concise, and maintainable way. It leverages PyDough's strengths in expressing business logic through composable operations and contextless expressions, making the code both readable and flexible.

## Example 2

### Question
```
Find, within the European region, for each brass part of size 15, the supplier who can supply it at minimum cost. If several suppliers in that region offer the desired part type and size at the same (minimum) cost, list the parts from suppliers with the 100 highest account balances. List the supplier's account balance, name and nation; the part's number and manufacturer; the supplier's address, phone number and comment information. This is also known as TPC-H query #2.
```

### Pydough Code
```python
selected_parts = (
    nations.WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")
    .suppliers.supply_records.part(
        s_acctbal=BACK(2).account_balance,
        s_name=BACK(2).name,
        n_name=BACK(3).name,
        s_address=BACK(2).address,
        s_phone=BACK(2).phone,
        s_comment=BACK(2).comment,
        supplycost=BACK(1).supplycost,
    )
    .WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
)
part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key)(
    best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
)
result = part_groups.p.WHERE(
    (supplycost == BACK(1).best_cost)
    & ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS")
    & (size == 15)
)(
    S_ACCTBAL=s_acctbal,

    S_COMMENT=s_comment,
).TOP_K(
    100,
    by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
)
```

# Explanation of Pydough Code for TPC-H Query #2

## 1. Pydough-specific Functions and Patterns

The provided code uses several Pydough-specific functions and patterns to solve TPC-H query #2. Let me explain the key ones:

### BACK Reference
The code uses `BACK()` to reference properties from previous steps in the data flow [82a3091]:
```python
.suppliers.supply_records.part(
    s_acctbal=BACK(2).account_balance,
    s_name=BACK(2).name,
    n_name=BACK(3).name,
    s_address=BACK(2).address,
    s_phone=BACK(2).phone,
    s_comment=BACK(2).comment,
    supplycost=BACK(1).supplycost,
)
```
This allows accessing properties from collections that are "behind" in the navigation chain. For example, `BACK(2)` refers to the suppliers collection, and `BACK(3)` refers to the nations collection.

### PARTITION
The code uses `PARTITION` to group data by a specific key [45c4498]:
```python
part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key)(
    best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
)
```
This groups the selected parts by their key and calculates the minimum supply cost for each group.

### WHERE
The `WHERE` function is used to filter data based on conditions [82a3091]:
```python
.WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
```
This filters parts to only include those with a type ending in "BRASS" and a size of 15.

### TOP_K
The `TOP_K` function is used to limit the results to a specific number of records, sorted by specified criteria [45c4498]:
```python
.TOP_K(
    100,
    by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
)
```
This returns the top 100 records sorted by account balance (descending), nation name (ascending), supplier name (ascending), and part key (ascending).

## 2. Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow with several transformations:

1. **Initial Selection**: Start with nations in the European region [82a3091]
   ```python
   selected_parts = (
       nations.WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")
   ```

2. **Navigation and Property Collection**: Navigate through suppliers and their supply records to parts, collecting relevant properties along the way [82a3091]
   ```python
   .suppliers.supply_records.part(
       s_acctbal=BACK(2).account_balance,
       s_name=BACK(2).name,
       n_name=BACK(3).name,
       s_address=BACK(2).address,
       s_phone=BACK(2).phone,
       s_comment=BACK(2).comment,
       supplycost=BACK(1).supplycost,
   )
   ```

3. **Filtering**: Filter to only include brass parts of size 15 [82a3091]
   ```python
   .WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
   ```

4. **Partitioning and Aggregation**: Group parts by key and find the minimum supply cost for each [82a3091]
   ```python
   part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key)(
       best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
   )
   ```

5. **Final Selection**: Select parts where the supply cost equals the minimum cost for that part [82a3091]
   ```python
   result = part_groups.p.WHERE(
       (supplycost == BACK(1).best_cost)
       & ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS")
       & (size == 15)
   )
   ```

6. **Output Formatting**: Format the output with the required columns [82a3091]
   ```python
   (
       S_ACCTBAL=s_acctbal,
       S_NAME=s_name,
       N_NAME=n_name,
       P_PARTKEY=key,
       P_MFGR=manufacturer,
       S_ADDRESS=s_address,
       S_PHONE=s_phone,
       S_COMMENT=s_comment,
   )
   ```

7. **Sorting and Limiting**: Sort by account balance (descending) and other criteria, and limit to 100 records [82a3091]
   ```python
   .TOP_K(
       100,
       by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
   )
   ```

## 3. Important Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several Pydough best practices:

1. **Chaining Operations**: Operations are chained together in a readable way [82a3091]
2. **Using BACK References**: BACK references are used to access properties from previous steps in the chain [82a3091]
3. **Partitioning for Aggregation**: PARTITION is used to group data before applying aggregation functions [45c4498]
4. **Clear Variable Names**: Variables like `selected_parts` and `part_groups` clearly indicate their purpose [82a3091]
5. **Proper Sorting**: The TOP_K operation uses a tuple of sorting criteria with proper direction indicators (ASC/DESC) [45c4498]

## 4. How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions in several ways:

1. **Operator Syntax**: It uses the standard Pydough operator syntax for functions like WHERE, PARTITION, and TOP_K [82a3091]
2. **Property Access**: It uses dot notation for property access (e.g., `region.name`) [82a3091]
3. **Calculation Syntax**: It uses the parentheses syntax for calculations (similar to CALCULATE in the reference) [82a3091]
4. **Sorting Specification**: It specifies sorting direction using ASC() and DESC() methods on properties [45c4498]

## 5. How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the requirements of TPC-H query #2 [82a3091]:

1. It finds suppliers in the European region
2. It filters for brass parts of size 15
3. It identifies the minimum supply cost for each part
4. It selects suppliers who offer these parts at the minimum cost
5. It sorts by supplier account balance (descending) and other criteria
6. It limits to the top 100 results
7. It includes all required information: supplier's account balance, name, nation; part's number and manufacturer; supplier's address, phone number, and comment

## 6. Key Examples from the Search

The search results show a similar implementation of TPC-H query #2 [82a3091]:

```python
selected_parts = (
  nations.CALCULATE(n_name=name)
  .WHERE(region.name == "EUROPE")
  .suppliers.CALCULATE(
    s_acctbal=account_balance,
    s_name=name,
    s_address=address,
    s_phone=phone,
    s_comment=comment,
  )
  .supply_records.CALCULATE(
    supplycost=supplycost,
  )
  .part.WHERE(ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS") & (size == 15))
)
part_groups = PARTITION(selected_parts, name="p", by=key).CALCULATE(
  best_cost=MIN(p.supplycost)
)
output = part_groups.p.WHERE(
  (supplycost == best_cost)
  & ENDSWITH(part_type, "BRASS")
  & (size == 15)
).CALCULATE(
  S_ACCTBAL=s_acctbal,
  S_NAME=s_name,
  N_NAME=n_name,
  P_PARTKEY=key,
  P_MFGR=manufacturer,
  S_ADDRESS=s_address,
  S_PHONE=s_phone,
  S_COMMENT=s_comment,
).TOP_K(
  100,
  by=(S_ACCTBAL.DESC(), N_NAME.ASC(), S_NAME.ASC(), P_PARTKEY.ASC()),
)
```

The main difference is that the reference example uses `CALCULATE` explicitly, while the provided code uses a more concise syntax with parentheses for the same purpose.

In conclusion, the provided Pydough code effectively implements TPC-H query #2, following Pydough best practices and conventions to create a clear, readable, and efficient solution.

## Example 3

### Question
```
Find the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value. Retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of the extended price times one minus the discount, of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of March 15th, 1995. orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist meeting the criteria, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed. This is also known as TPC-H query #3.
```

### Pydough Code
```python
cutoff_date = datetime.date(1995, 3, 15)
selected_orders = orders.WHERE(
    (customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING") & (order_date < cutoff_date)
)
selected_lines = selected_orders.lines.WHERE(ship_date > cutoff_date)(
    BACK(1).order_date,
    BACK(1).ship_priority,
)
result = PARTITION(
    selected_lines, name="l", by=(order_key, order_date, ship_priority)

    O_ORDERDATE=order_date,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY=ship_priority,
).TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))
```

# Explanation of Pydough Code for Finding Top Unshipped Orders

## Overview

The provided Pydough code identifies the 10 unshipped orders with the highest revenue value as of March 15th, 1995, from customers in the "BUILDING" market segment. Let me explain the code's components, patterns, and how it addresses the original question.

## Pydough-Specific Functions and Patterns

### 1. WHERE Function
The code uses the `WHERE` function to filter data based on specific conditions:

```python
selected_orders = orders.WHERE(
    (customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING") & (order_date < cutoff_date)
)
```

This filters orders to only include those from customers in the "BUILDING" market segment and placed before March 15th, 1995 [82a3091].

### 2. BACK Function
The `BACK` function is used to reference attributes from parent collections:

```python
selected_lines = selected_orders.lines.WHERE(ship_date > cutoff_date)(
    BACK(1).order_date,
    BACK(1).ship_priority,
)
```

Here, `BACK(1)` refers to the parent collection (selected_orders), allowing access to its attributes like `order_date` and `ship_priority` [e676197].

### 3. PARTITION Function
The `PARTITION` function groups data by specified keys and allows aggregations within those groups:

```python
result = PARTITION(
    selected_lines, name="l", by=(order_key, order_date, ship_priority)
)(
    L_ORDERKEY=order_key,
    REVENUE=SUM(l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)),
    O_ORDERDATE=order_date,
    O_SHIPPRIORITY=ship_priority,
)
```

This groups the line items by order key, order date, and shipping priority, then calculates the revenue for each group [82a3091].

### 4. TOP_K Function
The `TOP_K` function selects the top K records based on specified ordering criteria:

```python
.TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))
```

This selects the top 10 orders with the highest revenue, breaking ties by order date (ascending) and then by order key (ascending) [82a3091].

### 5. Sorting with DESC and ASC
The code uses `DESC()` and `ASC()` to specify sort order:
- `REVENUE.DESC()` - Sort by revenue in descending order
- `O_ORDERDATE.ASC()` - Sort by order date in ascending order
- `L_ORDERKEY.ASC()` - Sort by order key in ascending order [82a3091]

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data transformation pipeline:

1. **Initial Filtering**: Filters orders based on market segment and order date
2. **Line Item Selection**: Selects line items from filtered orders that haven't shipped yet
3. **Grouping and Aggregation**: Groups line items by order and calculates total revenue
4. **Selection of Top Results**: Selects the top 10 orders by revenue

This approach efficiently narrows down the data at each step before performing more complex operations [82a3091].

## Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Progressive Refinement**: The code progressively refines the dataset through a series of transformations, making it easier to understand and maintain [82a3091].

2. **Contextless Expressions**: The code uses contextless expressions like `(customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING")` that can be reused in different contexts [98d3972].

3. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Variables like `selected_orders` and `selected_lines` clearly indicate their purpose [82a3091].

4. **Efficient Data Processing**: The code filters data early in the pipeline to reduce the amount of data processed in later, more expensive operations [82a3091].

## How the Code Follows Pydough Conventions

The code follows Pydough conventions by:

1. Using method chaining for readability
2. Using standard Pydough functions like WHERE, PARTITION, and TOP_K
3. Following the pattern of filtering → transforming → aggregating → sorting
4. Using clear naming conventions for variables and calculated fields [82a3091]

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value as of March 15th, 1995. The code addresses this by:

1. Setting a cutoff date of March 15th, 1995
2. Filtering orders to those placed before the cutoff date
3. Selecting line items that haven't shipped yet (ship_date > cutoff_date)
4. Calculating revenue as extended_price * (1 - discount)
5. Grouping by order and calculating total revenue per order
6. Selecting the top 10 orders by revenue
7. Including the required output fields: order key, revenue, order date, and shipping priority [82a3091]

## Example from Documentation

From the documentation [82a3091], we can see a similar implementation:

```python
%%pydough

cutoff_date = datetime.date(1995, 3, 15)
selected_orders = orders.CALCULATE(
  order_date, ship_priority
).WHERE(
  (customer.mktsegment == "BUILDING") & (order_date < cutoff_date)
)
selected_lines = selected_orders.lines.WHERE(ship_date > cutoff_date)
output = PARTITION(
  selected_lines, name="l", by=(order_key, order_date, ship_priority)
).CALCULATE(
  L_ORDERKEY=order_key,
  REVENUE=SUM(l.extended_price * (1 - l.discount)),
  O_ORDERDATE=order_date,
  O_SHIPPRIORITY=ship_priority,
).TOP_K(10, by=(REVENUE.DESC(), O_ORDERDATE.ASC(), L_ORDERKEY.ASC()))
pydough.to_df(output)
```

This example is very similar to the provided code, with minor differences in syntax.

## Conclusion

The Pydough code effectively implements TPC-H query #3 to find the 10 unshipped orders with the highest revenue. It demonstrates efficient data processing by filtering early, uses appropriate Pydough functions for each transformation step, and follows Pydough conventions for readability and maintainability.
