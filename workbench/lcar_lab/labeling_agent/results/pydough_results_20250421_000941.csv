1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to find customers in Europe with specific criteria: account balance greater than $700, and having placed at least one order in 1995. The output should include the customer's name and the number of orders they placed in 1995, sorted by the number of orders in descending order.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
- Filter customers based on the condition that they are from Europe, have an account balance greater than $700, and have placed at least one order in 1995.
- Calculate the customer's name and the number of orders placed in 1995.
- Sort the results in descending order based on the number of orders.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
customers_1995 = customers.WHERE(
    (nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"") &
    (acctbal > 700) &
    (HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1)
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
- `customers.WHERE(...)`: This filters the customers based on the specified conditions.
    - `(nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"")`: Filters customers from the ""EUROPE"" region.
    - `(acctbal > 700)`: Filters customers with an account balance greater than 700.
    - `(HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1)`: Filters customers who have placed at least one order in 1995.
- `.CALCULATE(customer_name=name, num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)))`: This calculates the customer's name and the number of orders placed in 1995.
    - `customer_name=name`: Assigns the customer's name to the `customer_name` field.
    - `num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: Counts the number of orders placed in 1995 and assigns it to the `num_orders_1995` field.
- `.ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())`: This sorts the results in descending order based on the `num_orders_1995` field.
