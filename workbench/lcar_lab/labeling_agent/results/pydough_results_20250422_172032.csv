5,Find the names of all customers and number of orders placed in 1995 in Europe who have an account balance greater than $700 and placed at least one order in 1995. Sorted in descending order by the number of orders.,"SELECT c.c_name AS customer_name, COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_count_1995 FROM customer c JOIN nation n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey JOIN region r ON n.n_regionkey = r.r_regionkey JOIN orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey WHERE r.r_name = 'EUROPE' AND c.c_acctbal > 700 AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-12-31' GROUP BY c.c_name, c.c_acctbal ORDER BY order_count_1995 DESC, c.c_acctbal DESC;","1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks to find customers in Europe with specific criteria: account balance greater than $700, and at least one order placed in 1995. The output should include the customer's name and the number of orders they placed in 1995, sorted by the number of orders in descending order.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
- Start with the `customers` collection.
- Filter customers based on the following conditions:
    - They belong to a nation in the ""EUROPE"" region.
    - Their account balance is greater than $700.
    - They have placed at least one order in 1995.
- Calculate the customer's name and the number of orders placed in 1995.
- Sort the results in descending order based on the number of orders.

3. **The PyDough code:**
```python
european_customers_1995 = customers.WHERE(
    (nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"") &
    (acctbal > 700) &
    (HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1)
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
- `customers.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `customers` collection based on the specified conditions.
    - `nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""`: Checks if the customer's nation is in the ""EUROPE"" region.
    - `acctbal > 700`: Checks if the customer's account balance is greater than $700.
    - `HAS(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)) == 1`: Checks if the customer has at least one order in 1995.
- `.CALCULATE(customer_name=name, num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)))`: This calculates the customer's name and the number of orders placed in 1995.
    - `customer_name=name`: Assigns the customer's name to the `customer_name` field.
    - `num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: Counts the number of orders placed by the customer in 1995.
- `.ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())`: This sorts the results in descending order based on the number of orders placed in 1995.","european_customers_1995 = customers.WHERE(

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find suppliers in each nation who have a total availqty of more than 1000 units of parts with 'BRASS' in their type. The final result should include the supplier name, nation name, and the sum of the parts supplied, sorted in descending order by parts supplied. This requires filtering parts by their type, grouping suppliers by nation, calculating the sum of available quantities for each supplier within each nation, filtering suppliers based on the sum of available quantities, and finally sorting the results.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Filter the `parts` collection to include only parts with 'BRASS' in their `part_type`.
b. Join the filtered `parts` with the `supply_records` collection to access the `availqty`.
c. Join the `supply_records` with the `suppliers` collection to access the supplier's `name` and `nation_key`.
d. Join the `suppliers` with the `nations` collection to access the nation's `name`.
e. Partition the data by `nation_key` and `supplier_key` to group supply records by nation and supplier.
f. Calculate the sum of `availqty` for each group.
g. Filter the groups where the sum of `availqty` is greater than 1000.
h. Select the supplier name, nation name, and the sum of the parts supplied.
i. Sort the results in descending order by the sum of parts supplied.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to find the names of parts that are supplied by at least five different nations. The final result should include the part name and the count of distinct nations that supply each part. This requires joining parts with suppliers through supply records and then grouping by part name to count the distinct nations.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
a. Start with the `parts` collection.
b. Navigate to `supply_records` and then to `supplier` to link parts to suppliers.
c. Navigate from `supplier` to `nation` to identify the nation of each supplier.
d. Partition the data by `part_name` to group the supply records for each part.
e. Calculate the count of distinct nations for each part using `NDISTINCT(supplier.nation.name)`.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks for the top 10 customers who purchased the highest quantity of products with 'green' in the product name during 1998. We need to filter the lines collection for the year 1998 and products with 'green' in their name. Then, we need to group by customer and sum the quantity. Finally, we need to select the top 10 customers based on the total quantity ordered.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, filter the lines collection for the year 1998 and products with 'green' in their name.
Second, calculate the customer name, address and the total quantity ordered.
Third, group by customer.
Finally, select the top 10 customers based on the total quantity ordered.

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first filters the `lines` collection to include only those line items that were ordered in 1998 and whose part name contains ""green"". Then, it calculates the customer's name and address. After that, it partitions the result by customer name and address. Finally, it calculates the total quantity ordered by each customer and selects the top 10 customers based on the total quantity ordered.

9,Which is the average discount applied on orders for each market segment? Sorted in descending order,"SELECT c_mktsegment AS market_segment, AVG(l_discount) AS average_discount FROM customer JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey GROUP BY c_mktsegment;","```text
1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the average discount applied on orders for each market segment. This requires calculating the average discount for each market segment and then sorting the results in descending order. The market segment information is available in the `customers` collection, and the discount information is available in the `lines` collection. We need to join these two collections through the `orders` collection.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
First, we need to group the orders by market segment. Since the market segment is a property of the customer, and the order is linked to the customer, we can start from the `customers` collection and use PARTITION to group by `mktsegment`. Then, we can calculate the average discount for each market segment using the `AVG` function on the `lines.discount` field. Finally, we sort the results in descending order using `ORDER_BY`.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
market_segments_avg_discount = customers.PARTITION(name=""market_segment_group"", by=mktsegment).CALCULATE(
    market_segment=mktsegment,
    avg_discount=AVG(orders.lines.discount)
).ORDER_BY(avg_discount.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
- `customers.PARTITION(name=""market_segment_group"", by=mktsegment)`: This partitions the `customers` collection by the `mktsegment` field, creating groups of customers belonging to the same market segment.
- `.CALCULATE(market_segment=mktsegment, avg_discount=AVG(orders.lines.discount))`: This calculates the average discount for each market segment. `market_segment=mktsegment` selects the market segment name, and `avg_discount=AVG(orders.lines.discount)` calculates the average discount by navigating from customers to orders to lines and then applying the AVG function to the discount field.
- `.ORDER_BY(avg_discount.DESC())`: This sorts the results in descending order based on the calculated average discount.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks for the top 20 most popular parts within each market segment in 1998. This requires filtering the lines table by the year 1998, grouping by market segment and part name, counting the occurrences of each part within each segment, and then selecting the top 20 parts within each segment based on their count.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
a. Filter the `lines` table for the year 1998.
b. Extract the market segment from the `customer` associated with the `order` and the `part_name` from the `part` associated with the `lines`.
c. Partition the data by `mktsegment` and `part_name`.
d. Calculate the count of each `part_name` within each `mktsegment`.
e. For each `mktsegment`, select the top 20 `part_name` based on their counts.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block

4. Explanation of how the code works
a. The code first filters the `lines` table to include only records from the year 1998. It then extracts the `mktsegment` from the `order.customer` and the `part_name` from the `part` and stores them in `lines_1998_info`.
b. The `lines_1998_info` is then partitioned by `mktsegment` and `part_name`. Within each partition, the code counts the occurrences of each `part_name` within each `mktsegment` using `COUNT(lines)` and stores the result in `part_count`.
c. Finally, the `part_totals_per_segment` is partitioned by `mktsegment`. Within each `mktsegment`, the code selects the top 20 parts based on their `part_count` using `TOP_K(20, by=part_count.DESC())`.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to retrieve the customer names of those customers who placed more orders in 1995 than in 1994. This requires filtering customers based on their order counts in 1995 and 1994 and comparing these counts.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, calculate the number of orders placed by each customer in 1995 and 1994. Then, filter the customers based on the condition that the number of orders in 1995 is greater than the number of orders in 1994. Finally, retrieve the names of the filtered customers.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
customer_orders = customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)),
    orders_1994=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1994))
).WHERE(orders_1995 > orders_1994).CALCULATE(customer_name=customer_name)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first calculates the number of orders placed by each customer in 1995 and 1994 using the `CALCULATE` function and the `COUNT` aggregation function with a `WHERE` clause to filter orders by year. Then, it filters the customers based on the condition that the number of orders in 1995 is greater than the number of orders in 1994 using the `WHERE` clause. Finally, it selects the customer name using the `CALCULATE` function.","customer_orders = customers.CALCULATE(

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks for the average order value per nation. The order value is defined as extended_price * quantity. We need to calculate this value for each order and then calculate the average of these values for each nation.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, we need to calculate the order value for each line item. Then, we need to associate each line item with its nation. After that, we can group the line items by nation and calculate the average order value for each nation.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
nation_order_values = nations.customers.orders.lines.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=order.customer.nation.name,
    order_value=extended_price * quantity
)

average_order_value_per_nation = nation_order_values.PARTITION(name=""nation_groups"", by=nation_name).CALCULATE(
    nation_name=nation_name,
    average_order_value=AVG(nation_groups.order_value)
)
```

4. Explanation of how the code works
The first CALCULATE calculates the order value for each line item and associates it with the nation name.
The PARTITION groups the line items by nation name.
The second CALCULATE calculates the average order value for each nation.
