1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the top 3 regions with the most distinct customers. This requires counting the distinct customers for each region and then selecting the top 3 based on that count.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Start with the `regions` collection.
b. Use `CALCULATE` to count the distinct customers for each region using `NDISTINCT(nations.customers.key)`.
c. Use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 regions based on the distinct customer count.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
top_regions = regions.CALCULATE(
    region_name=name,
    distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(nations.customers.key)
).TOP_K(3, by=distinct_customers.DESC())

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `regions.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `regions` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields.
b. `region_name=name`: This renames the `name` field to `region_name`.
c. `distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(nations.customers.key)`: This calculates the number of distinct customers for each region by navigating to `nations.customers.key` and using the `NDISTINCT` function.
d. `.TOP_K(3, by=distinct_customers.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 regions based on the `distinct_customers` count in descending order.

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the top 5 nations with the highest number of orders placed by their customers in 1995. This requires filtering orders by year, grouping by nation, counting the number of orders per nation, and then selecting the top 5.

Analysis of the question
The question asks to find suppliers in each nation who supply parts with 'BRASS' in their type, where the total available quantity of these parts exceeds 1000. The output should include the supplier's name, the nation's name, and the total available quantity, sorted by the total available quantity in descending order. This requires joining suppliers, nations, and supply records, filtering by part type, aggregating availqty, and sorting the results.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, join the `supply_records` collection with the `parts` collection and filter the result to include only parts with 'BRASS' in their `part_type`. Then, group the filtered records by `supplier_key` and `nation_key` using PARTITION to calculate the total `availqty` for each supplier in each nation. Filter these groups to include only those with a total `availqty` greater than 1000. Finally, calculate the `supplier_name`, `nation_name`, and `total_availqty` for the remaining groups and order the results in descending order by `total_availqty`.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block
```python
supply_records_with_brass = supply_records.WHERE(CONTAINS(part.part_type, 'BRASS'))

4. Explanation of how the code works
The code first filters the `supply_records` collection to include only those records where the `part_type` of the associated `part` contains the string 'BRASS'. Then, it partitions the filtered `supply_records` by `supplier_key` and `supplier.nation_key`, calculating the sum of `availqty` for each group. After that, it filters the partitioned data to include only those groups where the `total_availqty` is greater than 1000.

1. Analysis of the question
The question asks to find the region with the highest total order value in 1996. The total order value is defined as the sum of extended_price * (1 - discount). This requires calculating the total order value for each region in 1996 and then finding the region with the maximum value.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution
First, calculate the total order value for each order in 1996. Then, aggregate these values by customer, then by nation, and finally by region. After calculating the total order value for each region, find the region with the highest total order value using TOP_K.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
First, filter the customers based on the region being Europe and account balance greater than $700. Then, calculate the number of orders placed by each customer in 1995. Finally, sort the result in descending order by the number of orders.
