Order by nation name,"SELECT n_name AS nation_name, COUNT(DISTINCT c_custkey) AS total_customers, COUNT(DISTINCT s_suppkey) AS total_suppliers FROM nation LEFT JOIN customer ON n_nationkey = c_nationkey LEFT JOIN supplier ON n_nationkey = s_nationkey GROUP BY n_name;","```text
1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. This requires grouping by nation and counting the number of customers and suppliers in each group. The final result should be ordered by nation name.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Start with the `nations` collection.
b. Use `CALCULATE` to count the number of customers and suppliers for each nation.
c. Use `ORDER_BY` to order the result by nation name.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
nation_summary = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    total_customers=COUNT(customers),
    total_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `nations` collection and uses the `CALCULATE` function to create new fields.
b. `nation_name=name`: This renames the `name` field to `nation_name`.
c. `total_customers=COUNT(customers)`: This counts the number of customers associated with each nation and assigns it to the `total_customers` field.
d. `total_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)`: This counts the number of suppliers associated with each nation and assigns it to the `total_suppliers` field.
e. `.ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())`: This orders the result by the `nation_name` field in ascending order.","nation_summary = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    total_customers=COUNT(customers),
    total_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())",,,0,True,
