The question asks for the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. This requires grouping by nation and counting the number of customers and suppliers within each nation. The final result should be ordered by nation name.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
- Start with the `nations` collection.
- Use `CALCULATE` to count the number of customers and suppliers for each nation.
- Use `ORDER_BY` to order the results by nation name.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
nation_summary = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_customers=COUNT(customers),
    num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
- `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `nations` collection and uses the `CALCULATE` function to create new fields.
- `nation_name=name`: This renames the `name` field to `nation_name`.
- `num_customers=COUNT(customers)`: This counts the number of customers associated with each nation and assigns it to the `num_customers` field.
- `num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)`: This counts the number of suppliers associated with each nation and assigns it to the `num_suppliers` field.
- `.ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())`: This orders the results by the `nation_name` field in ascending order.","nation_summary = nations.CALCULATE(

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the top 5 nations with the highest number of orders placed by their customers in 1995. This requires filtering orders by year 1995, counting the number of orders for each nation, and then selecting the top 5 nations based on the order count.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Filter the orders collection to include only orders placed in 1995.
b. Access the nations collection.
c. Calculate the number of orders placed by customers of each nation in 1995.
d. Select the top 5 nations based on the calculated order count.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
top_nations = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_orders=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).TOP_K(5, by=num_orders.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `nations` collection and uses the `CALCULATE` function to create new fields.
b. `nation_name=name`: This creates a new field `nation_name` and assigns the value of the `name` field from the `nations` collection to it.
c. `num_orders=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: This calculates the number of orders placed by customers of each nation in 1995. It first filters the `orders` collection to include only orders placed in 1995 using `WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`. Then, it counts the number of orders for each nation using `COUNT(...)`.
d. `.TOP_K(5, by=num_orders.DESC())`: This selects the top 5 nations based on the calculated `num_orders` in descending order.

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the region with the highest total order value in 1996. The total order value is defined as the sum of extended_price * (1 - discount). This requires calculating the total order value for each region in 1996 and then finding the region with the maximum value.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Calculate the total order value for each order in 1996. This involves filtering the orders for the year 1996 and calculating the extended price multiplied by (1 - discount) for each line item.
b. Aggregate the total order values by region. This involves grouping the orders by region and summing the total order values calculated in the previous step.
c. Find the region with the highest total order value. This involves sorting the regions by their total order value in descending order and selecting the top region.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
region_order_values_1996 = regions.WHERE(
  HAS(nations.customers.orders) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    region_name=name,
    total_order_value=SUM(nations.customers.orders.lines.WHERE(YEAR(order.order_date) == 1996).CALCULATE(line_value = extended_price * (1 - discount)).line_value)
).TOP_K(1, by=total_order_value.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `regions.WHERE(HAS(nations.customers.orders) == 1)`: This selects regions that have customers and orders.
b. `.CALCULATE(region_name=name, total_order_value=SUM(nations.customers.orders.lines.WHERE(YEAR(order.order_date) == 1996).CALCULATE(line_value = extended_price * (1 - discount)).line_value))`: This calculates the total order value for each region in 1996. It first filters the orders for the year 1996 using `WHERE(YEAR(order.order_date) == 1996)`. Then, for each line item, it calculates the line value as `extended_price * (1 - discount)`. Finally, it sums up the line values for all orders in the region to get the total order value.
c. `.TOP_K(1, by=total_order_value.DESC())`: This selects the region with the highest total order value by sorting the regions by their total order value in descending order and selecting the top region.
