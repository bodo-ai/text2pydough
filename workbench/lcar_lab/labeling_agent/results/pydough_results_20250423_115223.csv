5,Find the names of all customers and number of orders placed in 1995 in Europe who have an account balance greater than $700 and placed at least one order in 1995. Sorted in descending order by the number of orders.,"SELECT c.c_name AS customer_name, COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_count_1995 FROM customer c JOIN nation n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey JOIN region r ON n.n_regionkey = r.r_regionkey JOIN orders o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey WHERE r.r_name = 'EUROPE' AND c.c_acctbal > 700 AND o.o_orderdate BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-12-31' GROUP BY c.c_name, c.c_acctbal ORDER BY order_count_1995 DESC, c.c_acctbal DESC;","1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the names of customers in Europe who have an account balance greater than $700 and placed at least one order in 1995. The output should include the customer's name and the number of orders they placed in 1995, sorted in descending order by the number of orders.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
First, filter the customers based on the region being Europe and account balance greater than $700. Then, calculate the number of orders placed by each customer in 1995. Finally, sort the result in descending order by the number of orders and select the customer's name and the number of orders.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
customers_in_europe = customers.WHERE(
    (nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"") & (acctbal > 700) 
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
- `customers.WHERE(...)`: This filters the customers based on the conditions specified within the parentheses.
  - `nation.region.name == ""EUROPE""`: This ensures that only customers from European nations are selected.
  - `acctbal > 700`: This ensures that only customers with an account balance greater than 700 are selected.
- `.CALCULATE(customer_name=name, num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)))`: This calculates the customer's name and the number of orders placed in 1995.
  - `customer_name=name`: This selects the name of the customer.
  - `num_orders_1995=COUNT(orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: This counts the number of orders placed by the customer in 1995.
- `.ORDER_BY(num_orders_1995.DESC())`: This sorts the result in descending order based on the number of orders placed in 1995.","customers_in_europe = customers.WHERE(
    (nation.region.name == ""EUROPE"") & (acctbal > 700) 
).CALCULATE(
