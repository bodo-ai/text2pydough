1,List the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. Order by nation name,"SELECT n_name AS nation_name, COUNT(DISTINCT c_custkey) AS total_customers, COUNT(DISTINCT s_suppkey) AS total_suppliers FROM nation LEFT JOIN customer ON n_nationkey = c_nationkey LEFT JOIN supplier ON n_nationkey = s_nationkey GROUP BY n_name;","Here's how to generate the PyDough code to answer the question:

1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks for the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. This requires grouping by nation and counting customers and suppliers for each nation. The final result should be ordered by nation name.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   - Start with the `nations` collection.
   - Use `CALCULATE` to count the number of customers and suppliers for each nation.
   - Use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results by nation name.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**
```python
nation_summary = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_customers=COUNT(customers),
    num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `nations` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields.
   - `nation_name=name`: This renames the `name` field to `nation_name`.
   - `num_customers=COUNT(customers)`: This counts the number of customers for each nation.
   - `num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)`: This counts the number of suppliers for each nation.
   - `.ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())`: This sorts the results by `nation_name` in ascending order.","nation_summary = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,

    num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)

2,Find the top 5 nations with the highest number of orders placed by their customers in 1995.,"SELECT n_name AS nation_name, COUNT(o_orderkey) AS total_orders FROM nation JOIN customer ON n_nationkey = c_nationkey JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey WHERE o_orderdate >= '1995-01-01' AND o_orderdate <= '1995-12-31' GROUP BY n_name ORDER BY total_orders DESC LIMIT 5;","```text
1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks to find the top 5 nations with the highest number of orders placed by their customers in 1995. This requires filtering orders by year 1995, counting the number of orders for each nation, and then selecting the top 5 nations based on the order count.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
a. Filter the orders collection to include only orders placed in 1995.
b. Access the nations collection.
c. Calculate the number of orders placed by customers of each nation in 1995.
d. Select the top 5 nations based on the calculated order count.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
top_nations = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_orders=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).TOP_K(5, by=num_orders.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
a. `nations.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts with the `nations` collection and uses the `CALCULATE` function to create new fields.
b. `nation_name=name`: This creates a new field `nation_name` and assigns the value of the `name` field from the `nations` collection to it.
c. `num_orders=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))`: This calculates the number of orders placed by customers of each nation in 1995. It first filters the `orders` collection to include only orders placed in 1995 using `WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995)`. Then, it counts the number of orders for each nation using `COUNT(...)`.
d. `.TOP_K(5, by=num_orders.DESC())`: This selects the top 5 nations based on the calculated `num_orders` in descending order.
```","top_nations = nations.CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_orders=COUNT(customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1995))
).TOP_K(5, by=num_orders.DESC())",True,True,
