1,List the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. Order by nation name,"SELECT n_name AS nation_name, COUNT(DISTINCT c_custkey) AS total_customers, COUNT(DISTINCT s_suppkey) AS total_suppliers FROM nation LEFT JOIN customer ON n_nationkey = c_nationkey LEFT JOIN supplier ON n_nationkey = s_nationkey GROUP BY n_name;","```text
1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the total number of customers and suppliers in each nation. This requires grouping by nation and counting the number of customers and suppliers in each group. The final result should be ordered by nation name.

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
First, we need to partition the nations by their name. Then, within each nation, we count the number of customers and suppliers. Finally, we order the result by nation name.

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
nation_info = nations.PARTITION(name=""nation_group"", by=(name)).CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_customers=COUNT(customers),
    num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
).ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
- `nations.PARTITION(name=""nation_group"", by=(name))`: This partitions the `nations` collection by the `name` field, creating a partition named `nation_group`.
- `.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the following for each nation:
    - `nation_name=name`: Assigns the nation's name to the `nation_name` field.
    - `num_customers=COUNT(customers)`: Counts the number of customers in each nation.
    - `num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)`: Counts the number of suppliers in each nation.
- `.ORDER_BY(nation_name.ASC())`: This orders the result by the `nation_name` field in ascending order.","nation_info = nations.PARTITION(name=""nation_group"", by=(name)).CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    num_customers=COUNT(customers),
    num_suppliers=COUNT(suppliers)
