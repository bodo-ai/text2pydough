**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the entries in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates two fields:
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate=...`: Calculates the success rate.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'Completed'))`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer where the `status` field is exactly 'Completed'. This is assumed to represent a successful transaction.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer.
        *   The division calculates the ratio of successful transactions to total transactions. Multiplying by `100.0` converts this ratio to a percentage and ensures the calculation uses floating-point arithmetic.
3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection in ascending order based on the calculated `success_rate`. Customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.",23.338220834732056,"# Filter customers to include only those with at least 5 transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This defines a Python tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies for easier reference in the query.
2.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` object because we want a single aggregated result (the total count). `CALCULATE` is used to compute this final value.
3.  **`num_faang_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define the output field `num_faang_customers` and use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of customers that meet the specified criteria.
4.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply filtering conditions using `WHERE`.
5.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`**: This is the first condition. It filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
6.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines the two filtering conditions. A customer must satisfy both to be included in the count.
7.  **`(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1)`**: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions associated with each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: Filters these transactions, keeping only those where the transaction's `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_symbols` tuple (using the `ISIN` function).
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the filtered list of transactions (i.e., FAANG stock transactions for that customer) is not empty. It returns `True` (or 1) if the customer has made at least one transaction involving a FAANG stock.
8.  The `COUNT` function then counts how many distinct customers satisfy both the email condition and the FAANG transaction condition.",19.29427528381348,"# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the key date boundaries using the `Broker` top-level collection:
    *   `start_of_current_week`: Finds the date corresponding to the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday, depending on system settings) using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_period`: Calculates the date 8 weeks prior to the `start_of_current_week` using `DATETIME(..., '-8 weeks')`. This marks the beginning of our analysis window.

2.  **`transactions_in_period`**: We access the `Transactions` collection via `time_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates).
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: Filters transactions to include only those whose `date_time` falls on or after `start_of_period` and strictly before `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting the 8 full weeks preceding the current one.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction:
        *   `transaction_week_start`: Determines the start date of the week the transaction belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_flag`: Creates a numerical flag. It checks if the `DAYNAME` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using `ISIN`. If true, `IFF` returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

3.  **`weekly_transaction_summary`**: This performs the main aggregation.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_groups"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the `transactions_in_period` collection into distinct weeks based on the calculated `transaction_week_start` date.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week_starting_date`: Selects the `transaction_week_start` value (which is the same for all transactions in the group) to identify the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions`: Sums the `is_weekend_flag` for all transactions in the group using `SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_flag)`. Since the flag is 1 for weekend transactions and 0 otherwise, the sum gives the count of weekend transactions.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries in chronological order based on their start date.

        *   `(date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Ensures the transaction date is before the start of the current week, effectively selecting only transactions from *last* week.
        *   The `&` operator combines these conditions.
    *   **`total_transaction_amount = SUM(...)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for the same set of filtered transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to compute three new fields for each customer:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with the customer using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)`.
2.  **`result = customer_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the intermediate `customer_stats` collection and performs another `CALCULATE`:
    *   It keeps the previously calculated `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.
    *   It calculates `CR` (Customer Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. `RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` ranks the customers based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1). Since no `per` argument is specified, the ranking is performed across all customers in the `customer_stats` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply two filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `transaction_type == 'buy'`: Selects only buy transactions.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: Filters transactions that occurred within the last 10 days (inclusive of today). `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days.
2.  **Calculate Ticker Symbol:** We use `CALCULATE` to add the `ticker_symbol` (obtained from the related `ticker` record) to each filtered transaction record. This is needed so `ticker_symbol` can be used as a simple field name in the `PARTITION` step.
3.  **Partition by Ticker:** We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions based on their `ticker_symbol`. Each group (`ticker_group`) contains all the recent buy transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **Count Transactions per Ticker:** We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `ticker_symbol` group:
    *   We select the `ticker_symbol` (which is the partition key).
    *   We use `COUNT(Transactions)` to count the number of original transaction records within that specific ticker symbol's group, naming this count `num_buy_transactions`.
5.  **Select Top 2:** Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 groups (ticker symbols) with the highest `num_buy_transactions`, ordered from highest to lowest count.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final result containing the top 2 ticker symbols and their corresponding buy transaction counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",22.12946438789368,"# Step 1: Filter transactions to include only 'buy' types within the last 10 days.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first define `start_date` (6 months before the start of the current month) and `end_date` (the start of the current month) using the `DATETIME` function to establish the time window.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Customers**: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the calculated `start_date` and `end_date`. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `signup_year` and `signup_month` from their `join_date`.
3.  **Partition by Signup Month**: The `customer_info` collection is partitioned using `PARTITION` based on the `signup_year` and `signup_month`. This groups customers who signed up in the same month.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: Within each monthly group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   `signup_period`: We create a formatted string ""YYYY-MM"" representing the signup month using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting (e.g., ""2023-05"").
    *   `pmcs`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` within each partition group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   `pmat`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT) by taking the average (`AVG`) of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within that specific signup month group.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, `ORDER_BY(signup_period.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically based on the signup month.",24.70271921157837,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022_with_transactions`**:

    *   Filters customers using `WHERE` to include only those who joined in 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`) AND have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to select the `country` and create a new boolean/numeric field `is_active`. This field is `True` (evaluates as 1 in aggregations) if the customer's `status` is 'Active', and `False` (evaluates as 0) otherwise.

2.  **`country_activity_ratio`**:
    *   Takes the filtered `customers_2022_with_transactions`.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group these customers by their `country`. The group name is `country_group`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Selects the `country` for each group.
        *   Calculates the `AR` (Activity Ratio):
            *   `SUM(customers_2022_with_transactions.is_active)`: Sums the `is_active` flag for all customers within the current country partition. This effectively counts the number of active customers with transactions in that country.
            *   `COUNT(customers_2022_with_transactions)`: Counts the total number of customers within the current country partition (all of whom have transactions due to the initial filter).
            *   The ratio of these two counts is multiplied by `100.0` (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division) to get the percentage as defined by the AR formula.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This selects records from the `Transactions` collection, filtering for those where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"" and the `date_time` is within the last month (from exactly one month ago up to the current time, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
2.  **`transactions_with_symbol`**: This takes the filtered transactions and calculates the `ticker_symbol` by accessing the related `ticker` collection. It also includes `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` so these values are available for aggregation after partitioning.
3.  **`ticker_groups`**: This partitions the `transactions_with_symbol` data into groups based on the unique `ticker_symbol`. Each group contains all the relevant sell transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **`ticker_aggregates`**: For each `ticker_group`, this calculates the sum of `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` using the `SUM` aggregation function applied to the `Transactions` within that group's context. It retains the `ticker_symbol` as the grouping key.
5.  **`result`**: This final step takes the aggregated results and calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) using the provided formula: `(Total Amount - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`. An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, preventing division by zero errors and assigning an SPM of 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a `month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting and sorting) and retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker`. It also selects the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices needed for later calculations.
2.  **`monthly_stats = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data first by `symbol` and then by `month`. Within each unique symbol-month group, it calculates:
    *   `avg_close`: The average of the `DailyPrices.close` values for that group.
    *   `max_high`: The maximum of the `DailyPrices.high` values for that group.
    *   `min_low`: The minimum of the `DailyPrices.low` values for that group.
    The result `monthly_stats` is a collection where each row represents a specific ticker for a specific month, along with its calculated statistics.
3.  **`result = monthly_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the `monthly_stats` and calculates the final required fields:
    *   It keeps `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`.
    *   **`prev_avg_close=PREV(...)`**: This is the core of the MoM calculation. The `PREV` window function looks at the previous row's `avg_close` value.
        *   `by=month.ASC()`: It orders the rows chronologically by `month` before looking back.
        *   `per=""symbol""`: Crucially, it does this calculation *independently for each symbol*. It only looks at the previous month *for the same ticker*.
        *   `default=None`: If there is no previous row (i.e., it's the first month of data for that ticker), it returns `None`.
    *   **`MoMC=IFF(...)`**: This calculates the Month-over-Month Change. It uses `IFF` to handle edge cases:
        *   It checks if `prev_avg_close` is not `None` (meaning a previous month exists) AND if `prev_avg_close` is not `0` (to prevent division by zero).
        *   If both conditions are true, it calculates `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
        *   Otherwise (first month or previous average was zero), it assigns `None` to `MoMC`.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted alphabetically by ticker symbol and then chronologically by month for easier reading.",39.18846154212952,"# Step 1: Prepare DailyPrices data by extracting month in 'YYYY-MM' format

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_month`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. In the first `CALCULATE`, we extract the `YEAR` and `MONTH` from the `join_date` for each customer and store them as `join_yr` and `join_mth`, respectively. We also select the customer's `_id` and `name`, renaming them to `cust_id` and `cust_name` for clarity.
2.  **`customer_transaction_counts`**: We take the result from the previous step. In the second `CALCULATE`, we access the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer. We use `WHERE` to filter these transactions, keeping only those where the `YEAR(date_time)` matches the customer's `join_yr` AND the `MONTH(date_time)` matches the customer's `join_mth`. We then use `COUNT()` on this filtered sub-collection to get the number of transactions made in the same month the customer joined, storing this count as `num_transactions_in_join_month`. We pass along `cust_id` and `cust_name`.
3.  **`top_customer`**: We apply `TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())` to the `customer_transaction_counts` collection. This sorts the customers in descending order based on their `num_transactions_in_join_month` and selects only the top one (the customer with the highest count).
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the `top_customer` result to select and rename the fields as requested: `_id` (from `cust_id`), `name` (from `cust_name`), and `num_transactions` (from `num_transactions_in_join_month`).",22.640258312225345,"# Calculate the join year and month for each customer

2.  **`grouped_by_type = transactions_in_range.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on the unique values in the `transaction_type` field. Each group represents a specific transaction type.
3.  **`type_metrics = grouped_by_type.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (transaction type) created by the partition, this calculates:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the state of the associated customer (`customer.state`) and the type of the associated ticker (`ticker.ticker_type`), assigning them to new fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`state_ticker_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition the `transaction_info` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups the transactions based on the unique combinations of the values in the `cust_state` and `tick_type` fields. Each group is named ""combinations"".
3.  **`combination_counts = state_ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` again. We select the partitioning keys (`cust_state` and `tick_type`, renaming them to `customer_state` and `ticker_type` for the final output) and calculate the total number of transactions within that specific group using `COUNT(Transactions)`. This gives us the count for each unique state-ticker type combination.
4.  **`top_5_combinations = combination_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())` to select the 5 combinations with the highest `num_transactions`, sorting them in descending order based on the transaction count.
5.  **`result = top_5_combinations`**: The final result containing the top 5 combinations (customer state, ticker type, and number of transactions) is assigned to the `result` variable.",19.47833228111267,"# Calculate customer state and ticker type for each transaction

    *   It partitions the `transactions_with_month` data using the calculated `transaction_month` as the key. This groups all transactions from the same month together.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` applied to these monthly groups, it selects the `transaction_month` (aliased as `month`).
    *   It calculates the `average_transaction_price` for each month by applying the `AVG()` aggregation function to the `price` field of the original `Transactions` collection within each partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We first establish the time frame using `DATETIME`. `start_of_current_week` gets the date of the Monday (or configured start day) of the current week. `start_of_period` calculates the date 8 weeks prior to `start_of_current_week`.
2.  **Filter Relevant Payments:**
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection and filter for sales where `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   We access the associated payments using `.payment`.
    *   We then filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and strictly before `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting payments from the last 8 full calendar weeks.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping:**
    *   We use `CALCULATE` on the filtered payments (`relevant_payments`) to determine the start date of the week each payment belongs to using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')` and store it as `payment_week_start`.
    *   We also create a boolean flag `is_weekend` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` to easily identify weekend payments later.
4.  **Group by Week:**
    *   We use `PARTITION` on `payments_info` to group the records by the calculated `payment_week_start`. Each group in `weekly_groups` represents a unique week within our 8-week timeframe.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates:**
    *   We apply `CALCULATE` to the `weekly_groups`.
    *   `week=payment_week_start`: We select the partition key, renaming it to `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: For each week's group, we count all the associated `PaymentsReceived` records to get the total count for that week.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.is_weekend)`: For each week's group, we sum the `is_weekend` flag (where True is treated as 1 and False as 0). This efficiently counts the payments that occurred on a weekend within that group.
6.  **Order Results:**
    *   Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the weekly summaries by the week start date in ascending order.
7.  **Assign to Variable:** The final result is assigned to the `final_result` variable.",32.55540370941162,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week period before it

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%'))`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it.

    total_revenue = SUM(toyota_sales_last_30_days.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`toyota_sales_last_30_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these sales based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This checks if the `make` field of the associated `car` record (accessed via the `Sales.car` relationship) is exactly ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition `<= 29` ensures that only sales made today (0 days difference) or within the previous 29 days (up to 29 days difference) are included, effectively covering the last 30 days inclusive.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations at the top level of the database (`Dealership`). It uses the previously filtered `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection:
    *   `num_sales = COUNT(toyota_sales_last_30_days)`: This counts the total number of records in the filtered `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection, giving the number of Toyota sales in the specified period.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(toyota_sales_last_30_days.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` field for all records in the filtered `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection, calculating the total revenue from those sales.
3.  The final `result` variable holds a single record containing the calculated `num_sales` and `total_revenue`.",16.401750087738037,"# Filter sales to include only Toyota cars sold within the last 30 days (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes aggregate values for each salesperson:

    *   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson via the `sales_made` relationship.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales associated with the salesperson.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` operates on the results of the first one.
    *   It selects the previously calculated `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, and `num_sales`.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the rank (`SR`) for each salesperson based on their `total_sales_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider cars that have been sold at least once.
    *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1).SINGULAR().is_in_inventory == False`: This is a more complex condition to check the latest inventory status.
        *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)`: We look into the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`: We rank the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order. `== 1` selects the most recent snapshot.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking filter ensures only one snapshot (the latest) is selected per car, `SINGULAR()` allows us to treat it as a single record.
        *   `.is_in_inventory == False`: We check if the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot is `False`, meaning the car is not currently in inventory according to the latest record.
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions, so `filtered_cars` contains only cars that have been sold *and* are confirmed not in inventory based on their latest snapshot.
2.  **`make_model_groups = filtered_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_cars` collection.
    *   `name=""make_model_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition context.
    *   `by=(make, model)`: Groups the cars based on their unique combination of `make` and `model`.
3.  **`max_prices_per_group = make_model_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we calculate the required information.
    *   `make=make, model=model`: We include the make and model, which are the partitioning keys.
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: We calculate the maximum `sale_price` found within the `sale_records` of all `Cars` belonging to the current `make_model_group`.
4.  **`result = max_prices_per_group.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the results based on the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first).",36.731961250305176,"# Step 1: Filter cars that have been sold and whose latest inventory snapshot indicates they are not in inventory.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`**: This condition filters for cars where the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity. The `|` operator represents the logical OR.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select and compute the desired output fields.
4.  **`car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year, car_color=color, car_vin=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields from the filtered cars and assign them to new names (`car_make`, `car_model`, etc.) for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info`**: Calculates the start date of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the start date of the month 6 months prior (`six_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function. This defines the time window for filtering sales.
2.  **`relevant_salespersons`**: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
3.  **`sales_in_period`**:
    *   Accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection from the `relevant_salespersons`.
    *   Filters these sales using `WHERE` to include only those with a `sale_date` within the calculated 6-month window (greater than or equal to `six_months_ago_start` and less than `current_month_start`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month_str` field by formatting the `sale_date` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting). It also passes the `sale_price` through for later aggregation.
4.  **`monthly_sales_groups`**: Partitions the `sales_in_period` data based on the `sale_month_str`, grouping all sales from the same month together.
5.  **`monthly_metrics`**:
    *   Operates on the results of the partition.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to output the `sale_month` (renamed from `sale_month_str`).
    *   Calculates `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) by counting the number of `Sales` records within each month's partition group using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   Calculates `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) by summing the `sale_price` of the `Sales` records within each month's partition group using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
    *   Uses `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` to sort the final results chronologically by month.
6.  **`result = monthly_metrics`**: Assigns the final calculated and ordered monthly metrics to the `result` variable.

*Note*: This query calculates metrics for months within the specified range *that have sales data* matching the criteria. If a month within the last 6 months had zero sales from the selected salespersons, it will not appear in the output, as the `PARTITION` step only creates groups for existing `sale_month_str` values.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if each sale has at least one related inventory snapshot for its associated car (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets the specified conditions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, it creates a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., ""2023-05"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure the month part is always two digits). It also keeps the `payment_amount`.
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `payment_info` data based on the calculated `payment_month_str`. For each unique month string, it creates a group.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(month_str=..., total_payments=SUM(...))`**: Within each monthly partition, this calculates the total sum of `payment_amount` for all payments received in that specific month. It accesses the original `PaymentsReceived` collection context within the `SUM` aggregation as per standard `PARTITION` usage.
4.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the aggregated monthly totals.
    *   It selects the `month` (renamed from `month_str`) and the `total_monthly_payments`.
    *   It calculates the `mom_change` using the `PREV` window function. `PREV(total_payments, by=month_str.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_payments` from the *previous* record when ordered by `month_str` ascending. The `default=0.0` ensures that for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the previous value is treated as 0, preventing errors or null results in the MoM calculation for that first month. The MoM change is then calculated as the current month's total minus this previous month's total.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted chronologically by month.

*Note*: This query calculates the total payments and MoM change *only for months where payments were received*. It does not generate rows for months with zero payments if no payments occurred in those months within the dataset, as generating a complete date series is typically beyond the standard capabilities assumed for this type of query language based on the provided reference.",35.82025933265686,"# Step 1: Calculate month string (YYYY-MM) for each payment

3.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of records in the collection provided to it.
4.  **`Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Sales` collection and filter it using the `WHERE` clause.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`**: This is the core filtering condition:
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date.
    *   `<= 6` ensures we include sales from today (difference = 0) up to 6 days ago (difference = 6), covering the last 7 days inclusively.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those who have made at least one sale using `HAS(sales_made) == 1`. This ensures we only consider active salespersons and avoids potential division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:

    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the results from the previous step:

This effectively selects only customers who have made at least one purchase.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cash_payments = PaymentsReceived.WHERE(payment_method == 'cash')`**: This line filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to select only the records where the `payment_method` is 'cash'.
2.  **`salesperson_ids_from_cash_payments = cash_payments.sale_record.salesperson.CALCULATE(sp_id = _id)`**: Starting from the filtered `cash_payments`, we navigate through the relationships:
    *   `.sale_record`: Accesses the single `Sales` record associated with each cash payment.
    *   `.salesperson`: Accesses the single `Salespersons` record associated with that sale.
    *   `.CALCULATE(sp_id = _id)`: Selects the `_id` (the salesperson's unique identifier) from the `Salespersons` record and assigns it to a new temporary field `sp_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made) == 1)`**: We filter this collection. The `HASNOT(sales_made)` function checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` records for that salesperson) is empty. `== 1` means we keep only those salespersons for whom `sales_made` is empty (i.e., they have no sales records). This achieves the equivalent of finding rows from the 'left' table (`Salespersons`) that have no matching rows in the 'right' table (`Sales`) after a left join.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_sales_condition`**: This defines a reusable condition to filter sales that occurred within the last 30 days from today using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`.
2.  **`salesperson_performance`**:
    *   Starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute metrics for each salesperson.
    *   `s_first_name`, `s_last_name`: Selects the first and last names.
    *   `recent_sales_count`: Counts the sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`) but only includes those matching the `recent_sales_condition`.
    *   `recent_revenue_total`: Sums the `sale_price` of the sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`), again only including those matching the `recent_sales_condition`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no recent sales (resulting in a null sum), we output 0.0 instead.
3.  **`top_performers`**:
    *   Takes the `salesperson_performance` results.
    *   Uses `WHERE(recent_sales_count > 0)` to filter out salespersons with no sales in the specified period.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Sales` collection. For each sale record, it calculates three new fields:
    *   `customer_state`: Retrieves the state from the associated customer record (`Sales.customer.state`).
    *   `sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price` from the sale record.
    *   `customer_key`: Retrieves the unique identifier (`_id`) from the associated customer record (`Sales.customer._id`). This is needed later to count unique customers.
2.  **`state_aggregates = sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This step takes the `sales_info` data and partitions (groups) it based on the `customer_state`.
    *   `name=""state_sales""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(customer_state)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `customer_state` calculated in the previous step.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this `CALCULATE` operates on each state group:
    *   `state=customer_state`: Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer_key)`: Calculates the number of distinct `customer_key` values within the sales records belonging to the current state partition. This gives the count of unique customers for that state.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records within the current state partition. This gives the total revenue for that state.
4.  **`top_5_states_by_revenue = state_aggregates.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This step takes the aggregated results for each state and selects the top 5 based on the `total_revenue`, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC()`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Dealership` collection.
    *   `start_curr_iso_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the start date (Monday) of the current week based on the current timestamp (`'now'`). We assume the system's week start is configured to Monday for ISO week compatibility.
    *   `start_prev_iso_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Calculates the start date (Monday) of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
2.  **`payments_last_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_prev_iso_week` and `start_curr_iso_week` available) and filter the payments. The `WHERE` clause selects payments whose `payment_date` is on or after the start of the previous week (`>= start_prev_iso_week`) and *before* the start of the current week (`< start_curr_iso_week`), effectively capturing all moments within the previous full ISO week.
3.  **`payments_info = payments_last_week.CALCULATE(...)`**: We prepare the filtered data for partitioning.
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field `payment_day` by truncating the original `payment_date` to midnight. This ensures all payments on the same calendar day are grouped together, regardless of the time.
    *   `pay_method=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` field, renaming it slightly for clarity within the partition step.
4.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `payments_info` collection.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_day, pay_method)`: Groups the records based on the unique combinations of the truncated payment day and the payment method.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group.
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the day (which is a partition key).
    *   `payment_method=pay_method`: Selects the payment method (the other partition key).
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific `payment_day` and `pay_method` group. We refer back to the original collection (`PaymentsReceived`) within the context of the partition group to perform the aggregation.
6.  **`result = daily_totals_by_method.ORDER_BY(...)`**: The final result is assigned to the `result` variable, and `ORDER_BY` is used to sort the output first by date (ascending) and then by payment method (ascending) for better readability.",31.07422089576721,"# Calculate the start date of the current ISO week (Monday) and the start date of the previous ISO week.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, it calculates:
    *   `cust_state`: The state of the customer associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
    *   `quarter_number`: The quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4) derived from the `sale_date` using integer division `(MONTH(sale_date) + 2) // 3`.
    *   `sale_price`: Retains the `sale_price` for later aggregation.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_groups"", by=(cust_state, quarter_number))`**: Groups the `sales_info_2023` records based on unique combinations of customer state (`cust_state`) and quarter number (`quarter_number`).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   It selects the `state` and `q_num` (the partition keys).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter group. Note that `SUM` operates on the original `Sales` collection's context within the partition group.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after aggregation**: Takes the aggregated results and formats the output:
    *   `customer_state=state`: Renames `state` to `customer_state`.
    *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: Converts the numeric quarter (`q_num`) into the corresponding quarter start date string (e.g., 1 becomes '2023-01-01').

result = avg_ddd_per_drug
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Valid Treatments:** We start by accessing the `Treatments` collection. We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter only those treatments that have a non-null `end_dt` (`HAS(end_dt) == 1`) and where the duration between `start_dt` and `end_dt` is greater than 0 days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`). This prevents division by zero and adheres to the DDD definition requirement.
2.  **Calculate DDD per Treatment (Implicit within AVG):** Inside the main `CALCULATE` on `Drugs`, the `AVG` function operates on the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug. Within the `AVG`, we re-apply the same filters (`WHERE(...)`) to ensure we only consider valid treatments for that specific drug. Then, we use an inner `CALCULATE` to compute the `ddd_val` (which is `tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`) for each of these valid treatments.
3.  **Group by Drug and Average:** The `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)` structure effectively groups the results by drug. The `AVG(...)` function then calculates the average of the `ddd_val` computed in the previous step across all valid treatments associated *with that specific drug*.
4.  **Filter Drugs:** An outer `WHERE` clause is applied to the `Drugs` collection (`Drugs.WHERE(HAS(...) == 1)`) to ensure that we only include drugs that have at least one treatment meeting the validity criteria (non-null `end_dt` and duration > 0). This avoids calculating averages for drugs with no relevant treatment data.
5.  **Select Output Fields:** The final `CALCULATE` selects the `drug_name` and the calculated `average_ddd` for each qualifying drug.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final query result is assigned to the variable `result`.",32.72743105888367,"# Calculate DDD for each valid treatment first
# DDD = total drug amount / duration in days
# Filter treatments: end_dt must exist and duration must be > 0 days

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the start date of the current month (`start_current_month`) and the start date of the period 3 months prior (`start_period`) using the `DATETIME` function relative to 'now'. This defines the time window for our analysis (the last three full calendar months).
2.  **`treatment_info`**: We access the `Treatments` collection through `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates). We filter treatments whose `start_dt` falls within our calculated period (`>= start_period` and `< start_current_month`). For these treatments, we calculate:
    *   `treatment_month`: The year and month of the treatment start date, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"".
    *   `patient_key`: The `patient_id` associated with the treatment.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag indicating if the treatment used a drug with `drug_type` equal to 'biologic'.
3.  **`monthly_patient_counts`**: We partition the `treatment_info` data by the calculated `treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that started in the same month.
4.  **`CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`**: For each monthly group (`monthly_groups`):
    *   We select the `month` (which is the partition key `treatment_month`).
    *   `patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct `patient_key` values within that month's group using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)`. This gives the total unique patients treated in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: We calculate the number of distinct `patient_key` values *only for treatments where `is_biologic_treatment` is True* within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment == True).patient_key)`. This gives the unique patients receiving biologic treatments in that month.
5.  **`ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: The results are sorted chronologically by month.
6.  **`result = monthly_patient_counts`**: The final calculated data is assigned to the `result` variable.",34.03161025047302,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 3 full months, excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`) to get a single result (the count).
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_patients` and assign it the count of the filtered `Patients` collection.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it based on a condition.
4.  **`HAS(...) == 1`**: This checks if each patient has at least one record in their `treatments_received` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`**: This defines the beginning of the time window. It takes the current date/time (`'now'`), truncates it to the beginning of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracts 6 months (`'-6 months'`). This gives the date exactly 6 months before the first day of the current month.
2.  **`end_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`**: This defines the end of the time window (exclusive). It takes the current date/time and truncates it to the beginning of the current month. Treatments must start *before* this date.
3.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as we want to retrieve information about adverse events.
2.  **`.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == 'topical')`**: We filter these events. For each adverse event, we navigate through its singular relationship `treatment` to the corresponding `Treatments` record, then through the treatment's singular relationship `drug` to the corresponding `Drugs` record. We check if the `drug_type` field of this drug is equal to 'topical'. Only adverse events linked to treatments using topical drugs are kept.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select and rename the desired fields for the filtered adverse events:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: Calculates the start date of the current month and the start date of the month 12 months prior using `DATETIME` functions. This defines the time window for analysis.
2.  **`filtered_treatments`**:
    *   Starts with the `Treatments` collection accessed via `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates).
    *   Filters treatments using `WHERE` to include only those with a `start_dt` within the calculated 12-month window (greater than or equal to 12 months ago start, and less than the current month start).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `treatment_year` and `treatment_month` from `start_dt`.
    *   Crucially, it calculates `patient_id_if_diag` using `KEEP_IF`. This field will hold the `patient.patient_id` *only if* the treatment has an associated diagnosis (`HAS(diagnosis) == 1`); otherwise, it will be null.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: Partitions the `filtered_treatments` collection into groups based on the combination of `treatment_year` and `treatment_month`. Each group represents a specific month within our time frame.
4.  **`monthly_stats`**:
    *   Operates on the `monthly_groups` partition.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute the metrics for each month group:
        *   `pmpd` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_if_diag)`. `NDISTINCT` counts unique non-null values, so this correctly counts the distinct patients who had a treatment *with a diagnosis* starting in that month.
        *   `pmtc` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated using `COUNT(Treatments)`, which simply counts all treatments within that month's partition group.
    *   Includes `year` and `month` from the partition keys.
5.  **`result`**:
    *   Selects the final desired columns (`year`, `month`, `pmpd`, `pmtc`).
    *   Orders the results chronologically using `ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`.",36.41985321044922,"# Define the date boundaries: start of the current month and start of 12 months prior

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`new_patient_info`**: This step filters the `Patients` collection to include only those who have received at least one treatment (`WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`). For each of these patients, it calculates the year of their earliest treatment start date using `YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt))` and assigns it to `first_treatment_year`.
2.  **`yearly_new_patients_count`**: This step takes the `new_patient_info` and partitions it by the `first_treatment_year`. For each year group, it calculates the `year` (which is the partition key) and the count of patients within that group (`num_new_patients=COUNT(Patients)`). The result is then ordered by year in ascending order, which is essential for the next step using the `PREV` function.
3.  **`npi_calculation`**: This step takes the yearly counts and calculates the New Patient Increase (`npi`). It does this by subtracting the number of new patients from the *previous* year (`PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's count (`num_new_patients`). The `PREV` function looks back one record based on the specified ordering (`by=year.ASC()`), and `default=0` handles the first year where there is no previous year.
4.  **`result = npi_calculation`**: The final calculated data including the year, number of new patients for that year, and the NPI compared to the previous year is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.082088232040405,"# Step 1: For each patient with treatments, find the year of their first treatment start date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`valid_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. The condition `(field == field)` is a common way to check for non-null values when an explicit `IS NOT NULL` function isn't available or standard.
2.  **`overall_pasi_improvement = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This starts a calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`) because we need a single, overall result.
3.  **`avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(valid_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`**: Calculates the average `day7_pasi_score` using only the records stored in the `valid_outcomes` collection.
4.  **`avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(valid_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`**: Similarly, calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_filtered`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and filter it to include only those records where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)`. We then use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `ins_type` (insurance type) from the related `patient` record, creating a temporary field `insurance_type` needed for partitioning.
2.  **`insurance_type_groups`**: We partition the `treatments_filtered` data using `PARTITION`. The `name=""ins_type_group""` assigns a name to the partition context, and `by=(insurance_type)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `insurance_type` calculated in the previous step.
3.  **`insurance_type_stats`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `insurance_type` group:
    *   `ins_type = insurance_type`: We select the insurance type (the partition key).
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: We calculate the average of the `day100_pasi_score` found in the `outcome_records` associated with the `Treatments` belonging to the current insurance type group. `AVG` handles the aggregation over the potentially multiple treatments and outcomes within the group.
    *   `distinct_patient_count = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: We count the number of unique patients (`patient_id`) associated with the `Treatments` in the current insurance type group using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  **`top_5_insurance_types`**: We use `TOP_K(5, by=avg_day100_pasi.ASC())` to select the top 5 records from `insurance_type_stats`, ordering them by the calculated `avg_day100_pasi` in ascending order (lowest score first).
5.  **`result = top_5_insurance_types`**: The final result containing the top 5 insurance types with their average PASI scores and distinct patient counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",26.988529205322266,"# Step 1: Filter treatments that ended in the year 2022 and calculate the insurance type for partitioning.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cutoff_date_calc`**: We first calculate the date marking the beginning of our 6-month window. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months', 'start of month')` gets the current date, subtracts 6 months, and then finds the first day of that resulting month. This ensures we capture full calendar months.
2.  **`recent_treatments_info`**: We filter the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `six_months_ago_start`. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `speciality` from the linked `doctor` record, naming it `doc_specialty` to prepare for partitioning.
3.  **`specialty_groups`**: We use `PARTITION` to group the `recent_treatments_info` collection by the `doc_specialty`. Each group in `specialties` represents a unique doctor specialty.
4.  **`specialty_stats`**: For each specialty group created by the partition, we `CALCULATE` the required aggregates:
    *   `specialty=doc_specialty`: We retrieve the specialty name (which was the partition key).
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments)`: We count the number of `Treatments` records within each specialty group (using the original `Treatments` context available within the partition).
    *   `total_drug_amount=SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: We sum the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within each specialty group.
5.  **`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`**: We apply `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` to the `specialty_stats` to select the top 3 records based on the calculated `total_drug_amount` in descending order.
6.  **`result = ...`**: The final result containing the top 3 specialties, their treatment counts, and total drug amounts is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.33077478408813,"# Calculate the start date for the 6-month window (start of the month, 6 months ago)

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need to perform a global count aggregation.
2.  **`num_matching_treatments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a result field `num_matching_treatments` and assign it the count of the filtered `Treatments`.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and apply a filter based on the specified conditions.
4.  **`(CONTAINS(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), 'psoriasis'))`**: This checks the first condition. It accesses the linked `diagnosis`, gets its `diag_name`, converts it to lowercase using `LOWER` for case-insensitivity, and then uses `CONTAINS` to check if 'psoriasis' is a substring.
5.  **`(drug.fda_appr_dt != None)`**: This checks the second condition. It accesses the linked `drug` and verifies that its `fda_appr_dt` field is not null, indicating it has an FDA approval date.
6.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This checks the third condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time exactly 6 months before the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   The condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` falls strictly after 6 months ago and is less than or equal to the current moment.
7.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines all three conditions, ensuring a treatment is counted only if it meets all criteria.",19.95881199836731,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`**: This calculates the registration year we are interested in by getting the current year using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))` and subtracting 2.
2.  **`doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection to include only those whose `year_reg` matches the `target_year` and who have at least one prescribed treatment (`HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`).
3.  **`result = doctors_registered_2_years_ago.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates the first calculation step on the filtered doctors.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's registration year.
    *   `first_treatment_record=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`: This finds the first treatment for each doctor.
        *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1)`: Ranks the treatments within the context of each doctor (`per=""Doctors""`) based on the `start_dt` in ascending order. It then filters to keep only the treatment ranked first (the earliest one).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the ranking filter yields exactly one treatment record per doctor, allowing us to treat it as a singular record.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This second `CALCULATE` is used to access the fields *within* the `first_treatment_record` that was created in the previous step.
    *   `doc_last_name=doc_last_name`: Passes through the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=doc_year_reg`: Passes through the doctor's registration year.
    *   `first_treatment_date=first_treatment_record.start_dt`: Extracts the `start_dt` from the singular first treatment record.
    *   `first_treatment_id=first_treatment_record.treatment_id`: Extracts the `treatment_id` from the singular first treatment record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`placebo_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`**: This line starts with the `Treatments` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `is_placebo` field is `True`.
2.  **`qualifying_meds = placebo_treatments.concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each of the previously filtered `placebo_treatments`. It then applies another `WHERE` clause to filter these concomitant medications.
3.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`**: This calculates the difference in days between the start date of the parent treatment (`treatment.start_dt`) and the start date of the concomitant medication (`start_dt`). It ensures the medication started on or after the treatment began.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`**: This ensures the difference calculated above is less than or equal to 14 days (2 weeks).
5.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines the two `DATEDIFF` conditions, so only concomitant medications starting 0 to 14 days (inclusive) after the treatment start date are kept.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_name=name`**: Selects the merchant's name.
3.  **`distinct_successful_tx=COUNT(...)`**: This calculates the denominator for CPUR.
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'successful')`: Filters the transactions received by the merchant to include only those marked as 'successful'.
    *   `.txid`: Accesses the transaction ID field.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of successful transaction IDs for the merchant. We use `COUNT` assuming `txid` is unique per transaction.
4.  **`distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(...)`**: This calculates the numerator for CPUR.
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'successful') & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: Filters the received transactions for those that are 'successful' AND have an associated coupon (`HAS(coupon) == 1`).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` field from these filtered transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s used in successful transactions for the merchant.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary time boundaries using `Ewallet.CALCULATE`. `start_of_current_week` is the beginning of the current week, and `start_of_3_weeks_ago` is the beginning of the week three weeks prior to the current week's start.
2.  **`filtered_users`**: We filter the `Users` collection to include only those whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA' using `WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`.
3.  **`relevant_notifications`**: We access the `notifications` sub-collection for the `filtered_users`. We then filter these notifications using `WHERE` to keep only those created within the desired time frame (`>= start_of_3_weeks_ago` and `< start_of_current_week`). Inside `CALCULATE`, we determine the start of the week (`notification_week`) for each notification using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')` and create a boolean flag `is_weekend` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`.
4.  **`weekly_groups`**: We partition the `relevant_notifications` using `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=(notification_week))`. This groups the notifications based on the week they were sent.
5.  **`weekly_counts`**: For each partition (each week), we use `CALCULATE` to compute:
    *   `week_start_date`: The partitioning key itself (the start date of the week).
    *   `total_notifications`: The total count of notifications in that week's group, obtained using `COUNT(Notifications)`.
    *   `weekend_notifications`: The count of notifications sent on weekends within that week. This is calculated by summing the `is_weekend` flag (where True counts as 1 and False as 0) using `SUM(Notifications.is_weekend)`. We access the calculated `is_weekend` field through the `Notifications` sub-collection within the partition context.
6.  **`result`**: Finally, we select the required columns (`week_start_date`, `total_notifications`, `weekend_notifications`) and order the results by the week start date in ascending order for readability using `ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())`.",31.062671661376957,"# Define the time boundaries for the last 3 weeks (excluding the current week)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`us_user_txns_last_7_days = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `sending_user.country == 'US'`: Filters for transactions where the sending user's country is 'US'. It accesses the `country` field through the `sending_user` relationship.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures that the sender was indeed a user, not a merchant.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') < 7`: Filters transactions created within the last 7 days (0 to 6 days ago inclusive of today). `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's creation date (`created_at`) and the current moment (`'now'`). The condition `< 7` includes transactions from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago.

5.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since `TOP_K(1, ...)` guarantees returning at most one record per user, we use `.SINGULAR()` to treat the result as a single record.

2.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: This ranks the snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest date gets rank 1).
    *   `per=""Users""`: This crucial part ensures the ranking is done *independently for each user*. Snapshots are only ranked against other snapshots belonging to the same user.
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the snapshot with rank 1, which is the latest one for that specific user.
3.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause guarantees that only one snapshot (the latest) is selected per user, we use `SINGULAR()` to treat the result as a single record within the context of each user.

It does this by accessing the `transactions_received` sub-collection (transactions where the merchant is the receiver), filtering these transactions to include only those with `status == 'COMPLETED'`, and then summing their `amount`.

2.  **`result = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the `merchant_revenues` collection (which now has name, category, and total revenue for each merchant) and adds the rank:
    *   It keeps the `merchant_name`, `merchant_category`, and renames `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` as requested.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This applies the `RANKING` window function to the `merchant_revenues` collection. It ranks each merchant based on their `total_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the start and end dates for our analysis period.
    *   `start_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')`: Determines the first day of the month that was two months prior to the current month.
    *   `end_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: Determines the first day of the current month. Transactions *before* this date will be included.
2.  **`user_transactions_in_period = time_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection based on the calculated time boundaries and the specified `sender_type`.
    *   `(created_at >= start_period) & (created_at < end_period)`: Selects transactions that occurred within the last two full months (excluding the current month).
    *   `(sender_type == 0)`: Filters for transactions where the sender is a user, as per the PMDAU definition.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step prepares the data for partitioning.
    *   `transaction_month = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`: Extracts the month (represented as the first day of that month) from the `created_at` timestamp. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `sender_id = sender_id`: Explicitly includes the `sender_id` needed for the distinct count later.
4.  **`pmdau_results = user_transactions_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the filtered transactions based on the `transaction_month`.
    *   `name=""monthly_data""`: Assigns a name to the partition group.
    *   `by=(transaction_month)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the month calculated previously.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs the final calculation for each month's partition.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month identifier for the output.
    *   `pmdau = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: Calculates the number of distinct `sender_id`s within each monthly partition. This gives the PMDAU value according to the definition provided.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results chronologically by month.
7.  **`result = pmdau_results`**: Assigns the final computed collection to the `result` variable.",25.809373378753666,"# Define the time boundaries: start of 2 months ago and start of the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users`**: We start with the `Users` collection, as the request focuses on users.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to process each user record and derive new fields or select existing ones.
3.  **`user_id=uid`**: This selects the `uid` field from each user record and assigns it to the new field name `user_id` in the output.
4.  **`total_transactions_sent=COUNT(transactions_sent)`**: This calculates the total number of transactions sent by each user.
    *   `transactions_sent` is the sub-collection linking a user to the transactions they have sent.
    *   `COUNT()` is an aggregation function that counts the number of records in the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for the current user.
    *   The result of the count is assigned to the new field name `total_transactions_sent`.
5.  **`user_transaction_counts = ...`**: The final result, containing the `user_id` and `total_transactions_sent` for each user, is assigned to the variable `user_transaction_counts`.

This query iterates through all users and, for each one, counts how many transactions are listed in their `transactions_sent` list, effectively giving the total number of transactions sent by that user. It directly addresses the request without needing to filter for ""not a merchant"" because starting from the `Users` collection inherently selects only users.",17.66291069984436,"user_transaction_counts = Users.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and rename it to `user_id` in the output.
3.  **`total_duration_seconds=SUM(...)`**: We calculate the total session duration for each user.
4.  **`sessions.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `SUM`, we access the `sessions` sub-collection for each user and filter them based on the `session_start_ts`. The condition `(session_start_ts >= ""2023-06-01"") & (session_start_ts < ""2023-06-08"")` selects sessions that started on or after June 1st, 2023, and before June 8th, 2023.

    *   `total_tx`: The total count of transactions found in the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: Starts by accessing the `Users` collection and applying filters.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: Filters users whose country is 'US', ignoring case by converting the `country` field to lowercase.
3.  **`& (HAS(...) == 1)`**: Adds a second condition using the logical AND (`&`). The `HAS` function checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the inner criteria.
4.  **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the `notifications` sub-collection for each user, selecting only those notifications where `notification_type` is exactly 'promotional' and `status` is exactly 'unread'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, this step selects and calculates the final output fields for each matching user.
6.  **`user_name=username`**: Selects the `username` field and renames it to `user_name`.
7.  **`total_unread_promotional=COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of notifications for the current user that satisfy the same conditions used in the `HAS` check (`notification_type == 'promotional'` and `status == 'unread'`) and assigns the count to the `total_unread_promotional` field.",19.66500473022461,"result = Users.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_in_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on several criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Filters transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures that the sender was a user, excluding transactions sent by merchants.
    *   `status == 'completed'`: Includes only transactions that were successfully completed.
    *   `sending_user.status == 'active'`: Filters for transactions where the sending user has an 'active' status in the `Users` collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_month = ...)`**: For the filtered transactions, it calculates a new field `transaction_month` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `created_at` timestamp, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". This format is suitable for grouping and ordering chronologically.
3.  **`monthly_active_users = transactions_in_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transactions_in_2023` collection into groups based on the unique values of `transaction_month`. Each partition (`monthly_group`) contains all the filtered transactions for a specific month.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(month_date = ..., num_distinct_active_users = ...)`**: Within each monthly partition, this calculates:
    *   `month_date`: Selects the `transaction_month` value for the output.
    *   `num_distinct_active_users`: Uses `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user)` to count the number of unique sending users within that specific month's transaction group. `Transactions.sending_user` refers back to the sending users associated with the transactions within the current partition.
5.  **`result = monthly_active_users.ORDER_BY(month_date.ASC())`**: Finally, this sorts the results based on the `month_date` in ascending order (from earliest month to latest).

The final `result` variable holds the count of distinct active users who sent money each month in 2023, ordered chronologically.",24.86732697486877,"# Step 1: Filter transactions to include only those sent by active users in 2023 that were successful.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider merchants who have received at least one transaction (`transactions_received`) that meets the specified criteria.
3.  **`transactions_received.WHERE((DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150) & (receiver_type == 1))`**: Inside the `HAS`, `COUNT`, and `SUM` functions, we filter the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant. The filter keeps only transactions where:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150`: The transaction occurred within the last 150 days (inclusive). We use `DATEDIFF` to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` timestamp and the current time (`'now'`).
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: The transaction's `receiver_type` is 1, explicitly matching the request, even though `transactions_received` implies the merchant is the receiver.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the merchants who passed the `WHERE` filter, we calculate three fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: The name of the merchant.
    *   `total_transactions=COUNT(...)`: The count of transactions received by this merchant that satisfy the date and receiver type conditions.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(...).amount`: The sum of the `amount` for those same filtered transactions received by this merchant.
5.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())`**: Finally, we select the top 2 merchants from the calculated results, ordering them in descending order based on their `total_amount`.",29.877052307128903,"# Filter merchants to include only those who received transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line first accesses the `UserSessions` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to compute the duration of each session in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. It also explicitly includes `device_type` so it can be used as a partitioning key in the next step. The result is stored in the `session_durations` variable.
2.  **`session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the `session_durations` data and partitions it into groups based on the unique values in the `device_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `device_groups`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This `CALCULATE` operates on each partition created in the previous step.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters out any merchants that do not have associated coupons using the `HAS` function.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates intermediate values for each remaining merchant:

    *   `earliest_coupon=coupons.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1).SINGULAR()`: This finds the earliest coupon for the *current* merchant.
        *   `coupons`: Accesses the list of coupons associated with the merchant.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: Filters these coupons. `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns a rank to each coupon based on its `start_date` (ascending), restarting the rank for each merchant (due to `per=""Merchants""`). We select the coupon with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which is technically a collection containing one coupon) into a single record so we can access its fields like `cid` and `start_date`.
3.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the merchants based on the date comparison:
