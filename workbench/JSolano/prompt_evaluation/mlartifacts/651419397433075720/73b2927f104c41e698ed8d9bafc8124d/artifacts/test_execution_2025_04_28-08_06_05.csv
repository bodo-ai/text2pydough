**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window:** We first calculate the `start_of_current_week` and then determine `start_of_window` which is 56 days (8 weeks) before the start of the current week. This defines the date range for payments we are interested in.
2.  **Filter Sales and Payments:** We start with the `Sales` collection, filter for sales with `sale_price > 30000`, and access their related payments using `.payment`. We then filter these payments to keep only those whose `payment_date` falls within our defined 8-week window (`>= start_of_window` and `< start_of_current_week`).
3.  **Calculate Week Info:** For the filtered payments, we use `CALCULATE` to determine the `payment_week_start` (by truncating the `payment_date` to the start of its week using `DATETIME`) and a boolean flag `is_weekend` (checking if the `DAYNAME` is Saturday or Sunday).
4.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` to group these processed payments based on their `payment_week_start`. Each group now contains all relevant payments made within the same calendar week.
5.  **Aggregate Counts:** Within each weekly partition (`weekly_groups`), we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   We select the `payment_week_start` as `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received` is calculated by counting all payment records (`payment_details`) within that week's group using `COUNT()`.
    *   `weekend_payments_received` is calculated by summing the `is_weekend` flag using `SUM()`. Since boolean True is treated as 1 and False as 0, this effectively counts the weekend payments.
6.  **Order Results:** Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the weekly summaries by their start date in ascending order.",32.118403911590576,"# Define the time window boundaries: start of the 8th week prior to the current week,

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`: It checks if the uppercase version of the `vin_number` contains the substring 'M5'. Using `UPPER` ensures case-insensitivity, and `LIKE` with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching anywhere within the VIN.

2.  **`model_groups = filtered_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `filtered_cars` collection into groups.
    *   `name=""model_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition context.

        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`: Within the snapshots for *each* car (`per=""Cars""`), it ranks them by `snapshot_date` descending. The `WHERE(...) == 1` selects only the latest snapshot (rank 1).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking guarantees only one snapshot per car is selected, we mark it as singular.

3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains the substring ""mustang"", case-insensitively.
4.  **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two conditions, selecting cars where either the make contains 'Ford' OR the model contains 'Mustang'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range:** We first establish the time window for analysis: the start of the month 6 months prior to the current month (`start_of_period`) up to, but not including, the start of the current month (`end_of_period`).
2.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data:** We select `Sales` records falling within this date range using `WHERE`. In the subsequent `CALCULATE`, we format the `sale_date` into a 'YYYY-MM' string (`sale_month`) for grouping and create a boolean flag (`is_relevant_salesperson`) to identify sales made by salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive). We also retain the `sale_price`.
3.  **Partition by Month:** The filtered sales data (`sales_in_period`) is partitioned into groups based on the `sale_month` using `PARTITION(name=""month_data"", by=(sale_month))`. This creates a collection where each record represents a unique month within the period that had at least one sale (by any salesperson).
4.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics:** We then apply a `CALCULATE` operation on these monthly groups. For each month:
    *   We create an intermediate collection `relevant_sales_in_month` by filtering the sales within that month's partition (`month_data.Sales`) using the `is_relevant_salesperson` flag.
    *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) is calculated by counting the records in `relevant_sales_in_month`.
    *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated by summing the `sale_price` from the records in `relevant_sales_in_month`.
5.  **Default Null Revenue:** Since `SUM` might return null if there are no relevant sales in a given month, we use another `CALCULATE` with `DEFAULT_TO(PMSR, 0.0)` to ensure PMSR is 0.0 in such cases. `COUNT` naturally returns 0 when there are no records, so it doesn't need defaulting. This step ensures that months with sales activity but none from the target salespersons still appear with 0 metrics.
6.  **Order Results:** Finally, the results are sorted by the `month` string in ascending order using `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`.

This query structure ensures that all months within the last six (excluding the current) that had *any* sales activity are considered, and the metrics are calculated specifically for the salespersons hired in 2022-2023, showing 0 for months where these specific salespersons had no activity.",53.410324573516846,"# Define the start and end dates for the analysis period

**Explanation:**

1.  **`aggregated_sales_data = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary aggregate values at the top level (`Dealership`).
    *   `total_revenue_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`: It filters the `Sales` collection for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 and then sums up their `sale_price` to get the total revenue for that year.
    *   `total_cost_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`: It filters the `Sales` collection similarly for 2023, accesses the related `car` for each sale, and sums up their `cost` to get the total cost of cars sold in 2023.
2.  **`gpm_calculation = aggregated_sales_data.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the previously calculated totals and computes the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
    *   `gpm_2023=IFF(...)`: The `IFF` function is used for conditional logic.
        *   `total_cost_2023 == 0`: It checks if the `total_cost_2023` is zero to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   `0.0`: If the total cost is zero, the GPM is set to 0.0.
        *   `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`: If the total cost is not zero, it applies the GPM formula: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost * 100. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point division and represent the result as a percentage.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payments_with_month`**: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to create a new field `payment_month_str` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `payment_date`. This creates a sortable string like ""YYYY-MM"". We also select the `payment_amount` as `payment_val`.
2.  **`monthly_payment_totals`**: We then `PARTITION` the `payments_with_month` data using the `payment_month_str` as the key. This groups all payments that occurred in the same month. Within each partition (each month), we `CALCULATE` the `month_identifier` (which is the `payment_month_str`) and the `total_payment_for_month` by summing the `payment_val` for all payments belonging to that month's group (`monthly_groups`).
3.  **`result`**: We take the `monthly_payment_totals` (which now has one row per month with payment data) and `ORDER_BY` the `month_identifier` in ascending order to ensure chronological sequence. Finally, we `CALCULATE` the required output fields:

The `by` argument ensures `PREV` uses the same chronological order, and `default=0.0` handles the very first month in the dataset, treating its prior month's total as zero.

2.  **`.sale_record`**: This navigates from the filtered cash payments to their corresponding `Sales` records using the `sale_record` relationship.
3.  **`.salesperson`**: This navigates from the `Sales` records to the associated `Salespersons` records using the `salesperson` relationship.

2.  **`recent_sales=sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 30)`**: Inside the first `CALCULATE`, we access the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson and filter these sales to include only those where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date (`'now'`) is less than or equal to 30.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the customer's state (`customer.state`), the customer's unique identifier (`customer._id`), and the `sale_price`. We assign these to new, distinct variable names (`cust_state`, `cust_id`, `price`) to prepare for partitioning.
2.  **`state_groups = sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `sales_info` data using the `cust_state` calculated in the previous step. This groups all sales records belonging to customers from the same state together. The partition is named `state_data`.
3.  **`state_revenue_summary = state_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each state partition (`state_groups`), we calculate the required aggregates:
    *   `state=cust_state`: We select the state name (which was the partition key).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_last_3_months = Salespersons.sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `sales_made` for each salesperson. It uses a `WHERE` clause to select only those sales where the `sale_date` falls within the last 3 months, starting from 3 months before the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`) up to and including the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  **`salesperson_performance = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the required metrics for each salesperson.
    *   `rep_first_name=first_name`, `rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them for clarity.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_last_3_months.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of the sales filtered in the previous step (`sales_last_3_months`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_weekend_utility_payments` and assign the result of the `COUNT` function to it.
3.  **`PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsMade` collection and filter it based on the specified conditions.
4.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters for payments made specifically to the 'Utility Company'.
5.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`**: This condition filters for payments made on weekends.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)`: Extracts the name of the day (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_2023`):**
    *   Starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   Filters records to include only those where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Extract the customer's state (`cust_state = customer.state`).
        *   Determine the starting month of the quarter (`quarter_start_month`) using nested `IFF` functions based on the `MONTH(sale_date)`.
        *   Construct a string representing the first day of the quarter (`quarter_start_date_str`) using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `LPAD` (to ensure two digits for the month), and the calculated `quarter_start_month`.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`quarterly_sales_by_state`):**
    *   Takes the prepared `sales_data_2023`.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group the records based on the combination of `cust_state` and `quarter_start_date_str`. Each group represents a unique state and quarter in 2023.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data to:
        *   Select the `cust_state` (renamed to `customer_state`).
        *   Select the `quarter_start_date_str` (renamed to `quarter_start`).
        *   Calculate the `total_quarterly_sales` for each group by summing the `sale_price` of the original `Sales` records belonging to that specific state-quarter partition using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.

3.  **Final Assignment (`result`):**
    *   The final result containing the customer state, quarter start date string, and total quarterly sales for 2023 is assigned to the `result` variable.",41.753363847732544,"# Step 1: Filter sales records for the year 2023 and calculate the starting date string for each sale's quarter.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_march_snapshots`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `inventory_snapshots` associated with each `Car`.
    *   We filter these snapshots to include only those taken in March 2023 using `WHERE((YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) & (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3))`.
    *   We then apply another `WHERE` clause with the `RANKING` function:
        *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1` ranks the snapshots *for each car* (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first) and selects only the top-ranked one (rank 1). This effectively finds the single latest snapshot for each car within March 2023.

2.  **`cars_in_inventory_march_2023`**:
    *   We start with the `Cars` collection.
    *   We use `WHERE(HAS(...) == 1)` to filter the cars.
    *   Inside `HAS`, we reference `latest_march_snapshots` (which contains only the latest snapshot per car for March 2023) and apply a further filter `WHERE(is_in_inventory == True)`.
    *   The `HAS(...) == 1` condition ensures that we only keep cars for which their latest snapshot in March 2023 exists *and* has `is_in_inventory` set to `True`.
    *   Finally, `CALCULATE` selects the requested fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) and renames them for clarity.
