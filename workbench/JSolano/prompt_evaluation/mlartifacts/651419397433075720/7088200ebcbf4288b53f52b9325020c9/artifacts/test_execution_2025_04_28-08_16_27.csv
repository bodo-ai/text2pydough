```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate two key dates using the `Dealership` high-level collection:
    *   `current_week_start`: The exact date/time representing the beginning of the current calendar week (e.g., the most recent Monday or Sunday at 00:00, depending on system configuration).
    *   `start_date`: The date exactly 8 weeks before `current_week_start`. This defines the beginning of our 8-week analysis window.
2.  **`payments_in_period`**: This expression chain filters and prepares the payment data:
    *   `date_boundaries.Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`: Selects only sales records where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
    *   `.payment`: Accesses the list of associated `PaymentsReceived` records for these high-value sales.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_date) & (payment_date < current_week_start))`: Filters these payments to include only those made within our target 8-week window (from `start_date` up to, but not including, `current_week_start`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each payment within the timeframe:
        *   `payment_week_start=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Calculates the start date of the calendar week in which the payment occurred. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend=ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the payment date falls on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`. This creates a boolean flag (`True` if weekend, `False` otherwise).
3.  **`weekly_payment_counts`**: This performs the aggregation:
    *   `payments_in_period.PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=payment_week_start)`: Groups the prepared payment records based on the `payment_week_start` date. All payments from the same calendar week will be in the same group.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week=payment_week_start`: Includes the week's start date in the output.
        *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(payments_in_period)`: Counts the total number of payment records within that specific week's group.
        *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(payments_in_period.is_weekend)`: Sums the `is_weekend` flag for all payments in the group. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this effectively counts the weekend payments.
4.  **`result`**:
    *   `weekly_payment_counts.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries by the `week` start date in ascending chronological order.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each record represents one of the last 8 full calendar weeks, containing the week's start date, the total number of payments received for sales over $30k during that week, and the count of those payments that occurred on a weekend.",36.061975955963135,"# Calculate the start date of the current week and the start date 8 weeks prior.

3.  **`num_sales=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_sales`.
4.  **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (which contains all sales for the current salesperson) and filter it using `WHERE`.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`**: This condition filters the sales.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
    *   **`LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`**: This condition filters cars where the `vin_number`, converted to uppercase using `UPPER()`, contains the substring 'M5'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching. This ensures case-insensitivity and partial matching as requested.
    *   **`HAS(sale_records) == 1`**: This ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one associated sale record.
    *   **`&`**: Both conditions must be true for a car to be included.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`**: The filtered cars are then partitioned (grouped) based on their `make` and `model`. Each group represents a unique combination of car make and model that meets the initial filter criteria.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == 'Toyota'`: It selects sales where the associated car's make is 'Toyota'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`: It selects sales where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than 30. This effectively includes sales from today up to 29 days ago, covering the last 30 days inclusive of today.
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions, so only sales meeting both criteria are kept in the `recent_toyota_sales` variable.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final aggregate results at the top `Dealership` level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_stats = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection and calculates intermediate statistics for each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts in the next step.

    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `salesperson_stats` collection, ordering by the `total_sales_amount` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the salesperson with the highest sales gets rank 1.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`HAS(sale_records) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider cars that have at least one sales record, meaning they have been sold.
3.  **`inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`**: For each car, this accesses its `inventory_snapshots`, ranks them by `snapshot_date` in descending order (`DESC`), assigning rank 1 to the latest snapshot (`per=""Cars""` ensures ranking is done independently for each car). The `WHERE` clause keeps only the latest snapshot (rank 1).
4.  **`.SINGULAR().is_in_inventory == False`**: Since the ranking filter guarantees only one snapshot per car, `SINGULAR()` is used to treat it as a single record. We then check if the `is_in_inventory` field for this latest snapshot is `False`.
5.  **`.PARTITION(name=""make_model_group"", by=(make, model))`**: The filtered cars are then grouped (partitioned) based on their unique `make` and `model` combinations.

    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the model.
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the maximum `sale_price` by looking at all `sale_records` associated with the cars (`Cars`) within the current `make_model_group`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%') | LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`**: This condition filters cars where the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity.
3.  **`& (HAS(sale_records) == 1)`**: This ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one associated sale record in the `sale_records` sub-collection, allowing us to calculate a meaningful average sale price.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields.
5.  **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These select the basic car details directly from the filtered `Cars` collection.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range:** We first calculate the `start_date` (6 months before the start of the current month) and `end_date` (the start of the current month) using `DATETIME` functions.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data:** We access the `Sales` collection and filter it to include only sales falling within the `start_date` (inclusive) and `end_date` (exclusive). We then use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Truncate the `sale_date` to the start of the month (`sale_month`).
    *   Extract the `YEAR` from the associated salesperson's `hire_date`.
    *   Keep the `sale_price` for later aggregation.
3.  **Partition by Month:** The prepared `sales_info` is partitioned by `sale_month`. This groups all sales data from the specified period by the month they occurred in. This step ensures that all months within the 6-month range are represented in the output, even if no sales occurred in a particular month (or no sales by the target salespersons).
4.  **Calculate Metrics per Month:** We apply a `CALCULATE` operation on the partitioned data (`monthly_sales_partition`). For each month partition:
    *   We select the `sale_month` as `month`.
    *   We calculate `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) by counting the `Sales` records *within that month's partition* where the `salesperson_hire_year` is between 2022 and 2023.
    *   We calculate `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) by summing the `sale_price` of `Sales` records *within that month's partition* where the `salesperson_hire_year` is between 2022 and 2023. If a month has sales, but none from salespersons hired in 2022-2023, these aggregations will correctly return 0.
5.  **Order Results:** Finally, the results are ordered by `month` in ascending order using `ORDER_BY`.",31.08633065223694,"# Define the start and end dates for the 6-month period excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need a single average value across all payments.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to define the final output field `avg_days_to_payment`.
3.  Inside `CALCULATE`, we use the `AVG` aggregation function to compute the average.
4.  `AVG` operates on the results of an inner calculation performed on the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
5.  For each record in `PaymentsReceived`, we use an inner `CALCULATE` to compute `days_diff`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF` function with `""days""` as the unit, comparing the `payment_date` of the payment record with the `sale_date` from its linked `sale_record`.
6.  `.days_diff` accesses the result of this inner calculation for the `AVG` function.
7.  Finally, the `ROUND` function takes the calculated average and rounds it to 2 decimal places as requested.",15.86061406135559,"# Calculate the average number of days between the sale date and the payment received date, rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
2.  **`gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This starts a calculation at the top `Dealership` level to compute aggregate values.
    *   **`total_revenue_2023=SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`**: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales that occurred in 2023.
    *   **`total_cost_2023=SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`**: Calculates the sum of the `cost` for all cars associated with the sales that occurred in 2023. It accesses the cost through the `car` relationship from the filtered sales.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This subsequent `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed totals to calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
    *   **`gpm_2023 = IFF(...)`**: The `IFF` function is used to apply the GPM formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.0`.
    *   **`total_cost_2023 != 0`**: This condition checks if the `total_cost_2023` is not zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   **`(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`**: If the cost is not zero, this calculates the GPM percentage. Using `100.0` ensures the result is a float.
    *   **`None`**: If the `total_cost_2023` is zero, the GPM is set to `None`.
4.  **`result = gpm_calculation.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=gpm_2023)`**: This final step selects only the calculated `gpm_2023` value and assigns it to the `result` variable.",17.590620040893555,"# Filter sales for the year 2023

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payments_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step accesses the `PaymentsReceived` collection and prepares the data.
    *   It creates a `year_month_str` field by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `payment_date`. This creates a string like ""YYYY-MM"" which is essential for correct chronological sorting and grouping.
    *   It renames `payment_amount` to `payment_val` for use in the next step.
2.  **`monthly_grouped_payments = payments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This step groups the prepared payment data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(year_month_str))` groups the records based on the unique `year_month_str` values.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then operates on each group:
        *   `month_id=year_month_str` selects the identifier for the group.
        *   `total_monthly_payments=SUM(payments_info.payment_val)` calculates the sum of all `payment_val` within that specific month's group.
3.  **`result = monthly_grouped_payments.ORDER_BY(...).CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step calculates the MoM change.
    *   `ORDER_BY(month_id.ASC())` sorts the aggregated monthly totals chronologically based on the ""YYYY-MM"" string. This is crucial for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the *previous* month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the final output fields:
        *   `year_month=month_id` presents the month identifier.
        *   `total_payments=total_monthly_payments` includes the calculated total for the month.
        *   `mom_change=total_monthly_payments - PREV(...)` calculates the Month-over-Month change.
            *   `PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=month_id.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_monthly_payments` value from the immediately preceding row in the sorted data.
            *   The `by=month_id.ASC()` argument reinforces the order used for finding the previous record (though `ORDER_BY` already sorted it).
            *   `default=0.0` ensures that for the very first month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the previous value is treated as 0, so the MoM change is simply the total payment for that first month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made)==1)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those who have made at least one sale (`sales_made` sub-collection is not empty). This prevents potential division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
    *   `first_name=first_name`, `last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's name.

    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the results from the previous step:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those who have made at least one sale within the last 30 days.
    *   **`HAS(sales_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: Checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (representing sales linked to the salesperson) is not empty after filtering for recent sales.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30`**: This condition filters the `sales_made` to include only sales where the difference between the `sale_date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 30 days or less.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required information:
    *   **`s_first_name=first_name`, `s_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   **`total_sales_count=COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of sales records within the `sales_made` sub-collection that satisfy the 30-day filter.
    *   **`total_revenue_amount=SUM(...)`**: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales records within the `sales_made` sub-collection that satisfy the 30-day filter.
3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_count.DESC())`**: Takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 records based on the `total_sales_count` in descending order (highest count first).

2.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each salesperson.
3.  **`rep_first_name=first_name, rep_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them for clarity.
4.  **`total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`**:
    *   Accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(termination_date != None)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is not null, ensuring we only consider salespersons who have actually been terminated.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates new fields for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `full_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates a full name by combining the `first_name` and `last_name` fields with a space in between.
    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the `phone` field and renames it to `phone_number`.
    *   `employment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date` in days using the `DATEDIFF` function and assigns it to the `employment_duration_days` field.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`**: This selects the top 1 record from the results of the `CALCULATE` step, ordered by the `employment_duration_days` in ascending order (`ASC()`). This effectively finds the salesperson with the shortest employment duration.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week using the `DATETIME` function relative to the current moment (`'now'`). `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` finds the Monday of the previous week, and `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` finds the Sunday of the previous week.
2.  **`payments_last_week = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_info` context (which contains the calculated dates) and filter the records where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `prev_week_start` and `prev_week_end`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered payments, we calculate `payment_day` by truncating `payment_date` to the start of the day using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. We also select `payment_method` and `payment_amount` to be used in the next step.
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""day_method_groups"", by=(payment_day, payment_method))`**: We partition the `payments_last_week` data into groups based on the unique combinations of `payment_day` and `payment_method`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we calculate the final output:
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the date (from the partition key).
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method (from the partition key).
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(payments_last_week.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to that specific day and payment method group, referencing the amounts carried forward in the `payments_last_week` collection.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(payment_date.ASC(), payment_method.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first by date and then by payment method for better readability.
7.  **`result = daily_payment_totals_by_method`**: Assigns the final computed collection to the `result` variable.",28.249122381210327,"# Define the start and end dates for the previous ISO week

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection and filters it to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023 using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale record, it calculates:
    *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state from the associated `customer` record.
    *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: Determines the first day of the quarter ('YYYY-MM-DD' format) based on the month of the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions to check the month range (1-3 for Q1, 4-6 for Q2, 7-9 for Q3, 10-12 for Q4) and assigns the corresponding start date string for 2023.
    *   `sale_amount=sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price` to be used in the subsequent aggregation.
3.  **`result = sales_info_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the prepared `sales_info_2023` data and partitions it.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start_date)`: Specifies that the data should be grouped based on unique combinations of the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this calculates the final output for each group:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Includes the state for the group.
    *   `quarter_start=quarter_start_date`: Includes the quarter start date for the group.
    *   `total_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group (i.e., the total sales for that specific state and quarter).",28.624591588974,"# Filter sales records for the year 2023 and calculate necessary fields

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it based on conditions related to their inventory snapshots.
2.  **`HAS(inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if a car has at least one related record in the `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that meets the specified criteria.
3.  **`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`**: Filters snapshots to include only those from the year 2023.
4.  **`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`**: Further filters snapshots to include only those from March (the 3rd month).
5.  **`is_in_inventory == True`**: Filters snapshots to include only those where the car was marked as being in inventory.
6.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`**: This is the key part for finding the *latest* snapshot.
    *   It ranks the filtered snapshots (March 2023, in inventory) for *each car* (`per=""Cars""`).
    *   The ranking is done by `snapshot_date` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the most recent snapshot gets rank 1.
    *   `== 1` selects only the latest snapshot for that car within March 2023.
7.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the `Cars` collection to include only those that were in inventory in the latest March 2023 snapshot, this step selects and renames the required fields: `_id` (as `car_id`), `make`, `model`, and `year`.
