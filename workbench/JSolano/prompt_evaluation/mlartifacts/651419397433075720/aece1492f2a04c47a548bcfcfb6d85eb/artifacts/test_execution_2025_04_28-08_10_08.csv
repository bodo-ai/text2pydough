**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this calculates two fields:
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate = 100.0 * COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: Calculates the success rate. It counts the transactions with a `status` of ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies success), divides this by the total count of transactions for that customer, and multiplies by 100.0 to get a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.
3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection in ascending order based on the calculated `success_rate`, showing customers with the lowest success rates first.",18.577574253082275,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: Defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies for easier reference.
2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: Starts with the `Customers` collection and applies filters using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, '.com'))`**: Filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string '.com'.
4.  **`&`**: Combines the two filter conditions with a logical AND.
5.  **`(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1)`**: This is the second filter condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions associated with each customer.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate two key dates using the top-level `Broker` collection:
    *   `current_week_start`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `eight_weeks_ago_start`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week that started 8 weeks before the `current_week_start`.
2.  **`filtered_transactions = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection via `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates) and filter them based on:
    *   `date_time >= eight_weeks_ago_start`: Transaction occurred on or after the start of the 8-week window.
    *   `date_time < current_week_start`: Transaction occurred before the start of the current week.
    *   `ticker.ticker_type == 'stock'`: The transaction involved a ticker identified as a 'stock'.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered transactions, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date`: The date representing the start of the week in which the `date_time` falls, using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend`: A boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the `date_time` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, using `ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`. We also keep `transaction_id` for counting purposes.
4.  **`weekly_groups = filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_transactions` into groups named ""weeks"", using the calculated `week_start_date` as the partitioning key. Each partition now contains all the relevant stock transactions for a specific week within our 8-week window.
5.  **`result = weekly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition (each week):
    *   We select the `week_start_date` (renamed to `week_starting` for clarity).
    *   `total_stock_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: We count all transactions within the current week's partition.
    *   `weekend_stock_transactions=SUM(IFF(Transactions.is_weekend, 1, 0))`: We count the weekend transactions by summing the `is_weekend` flag (treating True as 1 and False as 0 using `IFF`).
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the results chronologically based on the `week_starting` date.",38.51072502136231,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week period before it

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Broker` collection.
    *   `start_of_current_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., the preceding Monday or Sunday, depending on configuration).
    *   `start_of_last_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Determines the timestamp for the beginning of the *previous* week by taking the start of the current week and subtracting 7 days.
2.  **`us_transactions_last_week = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which contains our calculated dates). We then filter these transactions based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Filters for transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week) & (date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Filters for transactions whose `date_time` falls on or after the start of the last week *and* strictly before the start of the current week, effectively selecting only transactions from last week.
3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we perform the aggregations on the filtered `us_transactions_last_week` collection:
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(us_transactions_last_week)`: Counts the number of transactions that met the criteria.
    *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(us_transactions_last_week.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field of all the transactions that met the criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply two filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `transaction_type == 'buy'`: Selects only buy transactions.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, 'now') <= 10`: Selects transactions that occurred within the last 10 days (inclusive of today). `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current time ('now').
2.  **Calculate Ticker Symbol:** In the same step, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `symbol` from the related `ticker` record and assign it to a new field `ticker_symbol`. This is needed for partitioning.
3.  **Partition by Symbol:** We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions based on the `ticker_symbol` calculated previously. Each partition (`symbol_group`) contains all recent buy transactions for a specific ticker symbol.
4.  **Count Transactions per Symbol:** Within each partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   We keep the `ticker_symbol`.
    *   We use `COUNT(Transactions)` to count the number of transaction records within the current partition (i.e., the number of recent buy transactions for that specific symbol) and name this count `num_buy_transactions`.
5.  **Select Top 2:** Finally, we apply `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to the result of the partitioning. This selects the 2 records (representing the 2 ticker symbols) with the highest `num_buy_transactions`, ordered in descending order.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final collection containing the top 2 ticker symbols and their corresponding buy transaction counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",26.821126461029053,"# Filter transactions to include only 'buy' types within the last 10 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the start and end dates for our analysis period using the `Broker` high-level collection.
    *   `start_period`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`).
    *   `end_period`: Calculates the last day of the previous month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 day')`).
2.  **`relevant_customers = date_boundaries.Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection through `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates) and filter them to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the `start_period` and `end_period`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(join_year=..., join_month=...)`**: For the filtered customers, we extract the `year` and `month` from their `join_date`. These will be used for grouping.
4.  **`monthly_metrics = relevant_customers.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `relevant_customers` collection into groups based on the `join_year` and `join_month`. Each partition represents a specific month within our analysis period.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each monthly partition (`monthly_signups`):
    *   `signup_month=JOIN_STRINGS(...)`: We create a formatted string ""YYYY-MM"" representing the signup month. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., ""01"" instead of ""1"").
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` within each monthly partition.
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT) by taking the average of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the customers within that specific signup month's partition. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers made no transactions, the average is reported as 0.0 instead of null.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`**: We sort the final results chronologically by the `signup_month`.
7.  **`result = monthly_metrics`**: The final calculated metrics per month are assigned to the `result` variable.",25.570709705352783,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`**: This line filters the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records where the date is within the last 7 days (today and the previous 6 days). `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, ...)` calculates the number of full days between the price date and now. The condition `<= 6` selects records from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago.
2.  **`price_info = recent_prices.CALCULATE(ticker_type = ticker.ticker_type)`**: This calculates a new intermediate collection `price_info`. For each recent price record, it fetches the `ticker_type` from the associated `ticker` record and adds it as a field. This is necessary because `PARTITION` requires the partitioning key (`ticker_type` in this case) to be a direct field of the collection being partitioned.
3.  **`ticker_type_groups = price_info.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(ticker_type))`**: This partitions the `price_info` collection into groups based on the unique values of the `ticker_type` field. Each group in `ticker_type_groups` represents a distinct ticker type found within the recent prices.
4.  **`result = ticker_type_groups.CALCULATE(ticker_type = ticker_type, ACP = AVG(DailyPrices.close))`**: This final step calculates the desired output for each group created by the partition.
    *   `ticker_type = ticker_type`: Selects the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP = AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: Calculates the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each group. It uses the `AVG` aggregation function on the `close` field of the `DailyPrices` collection. The `PARTITION` ensures that this average is computed only over the `DailyPrices` records belonging to the specific `ticker_type` group within the filtered 7-day timeframe.",32.40733098983765,"# Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_joined_2022_with_trans`**: This variable filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`) and have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
2.  **`country_groups`**: We partition the filtered customers by their `country` using `PARTITION`. Each partition (`country_data`) contains customers from a specific country who meet the initial filter criteria.
3.  **`country_stats`**: Within each country partition, we calculate:
    *   `country`: The name of the country (from the partition key).
    *   `num_active_customers`: The count of customers within the partition (`country_data.Customers`) whose `status` is 'Active'.
    *   `total_customers_with_trans`: The total count of customers within the partition (`country_data.Customers`).
4.  **`activity_ratio_by_country`**: We calculate the Activity Ratio (AR) using the formula provided. `100.0` is used to ensure floating-point division. The `IFF` function handles the case where a country might have zero customers meeting the criteria (though unlikely given the initial filter `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), preventing division by zero and assigning an AR of 0.0 in such cases.
5.  **`result`**: The final result containing the `country` and its calculated `AR` is assigned to the `result` variable.",22.012027502059937,"# Filter customers who joined in 2022 and have made transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  **`customer_count=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `customer_count` which will hold the result of counting the customers who meet the criteria.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply filtering conditions using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')) | (ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the name condition.
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|` (OR) combines these two conditions, so the customer's name must satisfy at least one of them.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This part checks the state condition.
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the customer's state to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
6.  **`&`**: The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition and the state condition, ensuring that customers must satisfy both sets of criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is 'sell' and the `date_time` is within the last month (from exactly one month ago up to the current time, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`). It also uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `ticker.symbol`, `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` for further processing.
2.  **`ticker_groups`**: This step partitions the `filtered_transactions` based on the `ticker_symbol`. For each unique ticker symbol group (`ticker_group`), it calculates the sum of `amount` (as `total_sell_amount`), `tax` (as `total_tax`), and `commission` (as `total_commission`) by accessing the relevant fields from the original `Transactions` collection within the context of each partition group.
3.  **`result`**: This final step takes the aggregated results from `ticker_groups` and calculates the Selling Profit Margin (`spm`) for each `ticker_symbol` using the formula: `(total_sell_amount - (total_tax + total_commission)) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`. An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_sell_amount` might be zero, returning `0.0` for SPM in such instances to prevent division by zero errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step preprocesses the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   It creates a `month_str` field in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure months like '01', '02').
    *   It retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker`.
    *   It keeps the `close`, `high`, `low`, and `date` values, renaming them for clarity (`close_price`, `high_price`, `low_price`, `date_val`).
2.  **`monthly_groups = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""ticker_months"", by=(symbol, month_str))`: Groups the data first by `symbol` and then by the calculated `month_str`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Within each group (each ticker-month combination), it calculates:
        *   `avg_close`: The average of `DailyPrices.close_price`.
        *   `max_high`: The maximum of `DailyPrices.high_price`.
        *   `min_low`: The minimum of `DailyPrices.low_price`.
        *   It also retains the `symbol` and `month` (renamed from `month_str`) partition keys.
3.  **`ordered_monthly_groups = monthly_groups.ORDER_BY(...)`**: This step sorts the aggregated monthly data first by `symbol` and then chronologically by `month`. This ordering is crucial for the correct functioning of the `PREV` function in the next step.
4.  **`result = ordered_monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final calculation step computes the Month-over-Month Change (MoMC).
    *   It retains the `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low` fields.
    *   `prev_avg_close=PREV(avg_close, by=(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC()), per=""symbol"", default=None)`: This uses the `PREV` window function to get the `avg_close` from the *previous* record within the *same* `symbol` partition, based on the specified `month` ordering. If there's no previous record (i.e., the first month for a symbol), it defaults to `None`.
    *   `momc=IFF(...)`: This calculates the MoMC using the formula `(current - previous) / previous`. The `IFF` function handles edge cases: if `prev_avg_close` is `None` or `0`, `momc` is set to `None` to avoid errors or meaningless results.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`: Ensures the final output is sorted consistently by symbol and then by month.",32.23143911361694,"# Step 1: Calculate month string and retrieve symbol for each daily price record

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.WHERE(...)`**: Starts with the `Tickers` collection and filters out any tickers that do not have at least one `historical_prices` record within the specified date range (`2023-04-01` to `2023-04-04`). This ensures we only process relevant stocks.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: For each remaining ticker:
    *   Selects the `symbol` and assigns it to `ticker_symbol`.
    *   Calculates `max_high_in_range` by finding the maximum `high` price among its `historical_prices` records within the date range.
    *   Calculates `min_low_in_range` by finding the minimum `low` price among its `historical_prices` records within the date range.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: Takes the results from the previous step and:
    *   Keeps the `ticker_symbol`.
    *   Calculates the `price_change` by subtracting the `min_low_in_range` from the `max_high_in_range`.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: Selects the top 3 records based on the calculated `price_change`, ordered from the highest change downwards.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection.

These are stored as temporary variables.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` takes the output of the first. It keeps `cust_id` and `cust_name`. It then calculates `num_transactions` by:
    *   Accessing the customer's `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   Filtering these transactions using `WHERE` to keep only those where the transaction's year (`YEAR(date_time)`) matches the customer's `join_yr` AND the transaction's month (`MONTH(date_time)`) matches the customer's `join_mo`.
    *   Counting the remaining transactions using `COUNT()`.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions.DESC())`**: This selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest (`DESC()`) value for the calculated `num_transactions`.

2.  **`state_type_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection into groups based on unique combinations of the `cust_state` and `tick_type` fields calculated in the previous step. Each group represents a specific state/ticker-type pair.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_transactions_filter = DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 30`**: This defines a reusable filter condition to identify transactions where the difference between the transaction `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 30 days or less.
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection and filter it to include only those customers who have made at least one transaction matching the `recent_transactions_filter`. The `HAS(...) == 1` check ensures we only process relevant customers.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**: The filtered customers are then partitioned (grouped) based on their `country`. Each partition represents a unique country containing all customers from that country who had recent transactions.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each country partition (`country_groups`):

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to include only those customers who have at least one transaction associated with them (i.e., the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes each filtered customer.
3.  **`customer_id=_id`**: Selects the customer's `_id` and renames it to `customer_id`.
4.  **`join_to_first_txn_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: This calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and their earliest transaction date.
    *   **`MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`**: Finds the minimum (earliest) `date_time` among all transactions made by the customer. This effectively gives the date of the first transaction.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`**: Calculates the number of full days between the `join_date` and the calculated minimum transaction date.
    *   The result of the `DATEDIFF` calculation is assigned to the new field `join_to_first_txn_days`.

The final output `result` will contain rows for each customer who has made at least one transaction, with columns `customer_id` and `join_to_first_txn_days`.",17.61276912689209,"result = Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_year`, `target_month`, `target_day`**: Define the specific date components (2023, 4, 1) for filtering.
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: Starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to include only those customers who have made at least one 'sell' transaction on the specified date (2023-04-01). This pre-filtering using `HAS` can improve efficiency by avoiding calculations for customers with no relevant transactions.
3.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: Checks if the customer has one or more transactions matching the criteria:
    *   `transaction_type == 'sell'`: Filters for sell transactions.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == target_year`, `MONTH(date_time) == target_month`, `DAY(date_time) == target_day`: Filters transactions that occurred exactly on 2023-04-01.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, calculates new fields:
    *   `cust_id=_id`: Selects the customer's ID.
    *   `cust_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer that meet the 'sell' type and date criteria again.
5.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions.DESC())`**: Sorts the resulting customers based on `num_transactions` in descending order and selects only the top 1 customer (the one with the most transactions).
6.  **`result = top_selling_customer`**: Assigns the final result (the single customer record with `cust_id`, `cust_name`, and `num_transactions`) to the `result` variable.",25.069016218185425,"import datetime

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Selects only transactions marked as ""successful"".
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions that occurred in January (1), February (2), or March (3), covering the first quarter.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`**: After filtering, this calculates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month number from the `date_time` field for each remaining transaction.
3.  **`monthly_avg_prices = filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the `filtered_transactions` and partitions (groups) them.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(transaction_month)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values of the `transaction_month` field calculated earlier.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each partition (each month group).
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month value (which is the partition key).
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to the current month's partition group. It accesses the `price` from the original `Transactions` collection context within the partition.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results in ascending order based on the `month`.
6.  **`result = monthly_avg_prices`**: Assigns the final calculated and ordered monthly average prices to the `result` variable.",18.958731412887573,"# Filter transactions for successful status in Q1 2023 and calculate the month
