**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the transaction success rate for customers with 5 or more transactions.
2.  **Input Collection:** `Customers`.
3.  **Filtering:** Keep only customers where the count of their `transactions_made` is 5 or greater.
4.  **Calculations:**
    *   Count total transactions for each customer (`COUNT(transactions_made)`).
    *   Count successful transactions (where `status == 'COMPLETED'`) for each customer (`COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'COMPLETED'))`).
    *   Calculate success rate: `(successful transactions / total transactions) * 100.0`.
5.  **Output Fields:** Customer `name` and the calculated `success_rate`.
6.  **Ordering:** Sort the results by `success_rate` in ascending order.

**PyDough Code Generation:**

```python
# Calculate total and successful transactions per customer
customer_transaction_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(
    cust_name=name,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    successful_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'COMPLETED'))
)

# Filter for customers with at least 5 transactions and calculate success rate
customer_success_rates = customer_transaction_stats.WHERE(total_transactions >= 5).CALCULATE(
    cust_name=cust_name,
    success_rate=IFF(total_transactions > 0, 100.0 * successful_transactions / total_transactions, 0.0) # Calculate rate, handle potential division by zero although filtered
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC()) # Order by success rate ascending

result = customer_success_rates
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it calculates:
    *   `cust_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `total_transactions`: Counts all transactions linked to the customer via the `transactions_made` relationship.
    *   `successful_transactions`: Counts only those transactions linked to the customer where the `status` field is exactly 'COMPLETED'.
2.  **`customer_success_rates = customer_transaction_stats.WHERE(...)`**: This line takes the intermediate result (`customer_transaction_stats`) and filters it:
    *   `WHERE(total_transactions >= 5)`: Keeps only those customers who have 5 or more total transactions.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs the final calculation and selection on the filtered customers:
    *   `cust_name=cust_name`: Selects the customer name calculated in the previous step.
    *   `success_rate=IFF(...)`: Calculates the success rate by dividing `successful_transactions` by `total_transactions` and multiplying by `100.0` to get a percentage. The `IFF` function ensures that if `total_transactions` were somehow 0 (though filtered out by the `WHERE`), it would return 0.0 instead of causing a division-by-zero error.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: This sorts the final results based on the calculated `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest rate first).
5.  **`result = customer_success_rates`**: Assigns the final, ordered collection to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE total and successful transactions per customer

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This line defines a contextless expression (a tuple) containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to read.
2.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` graph because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
3.  **`num_faang_buyers_with_com_email=COUNT(...)`**: We use `CALCULATE` to define the final output field `num_faang_buyers_with_com_email`. The value is determined by counting the results of the expression inside `COUNT()`.
4.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`.
5.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`**: This is the first filter condition. It checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string "".com"".
6.  **`&`**: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two filter conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
7.  **`(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1)`**: This is the second filter condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions associated with the customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: Filters these transactions, keeping only those where the associated `ticker`'s `symbol` is present in the `faang_symbols` tuple (using the `ISIN` function).
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the result of the inner filtering (the list of FAANG transactions for the customer) is not empty (i.e., the customer has made at least one transaction involving a FAANG stock).
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the number of distinct `Customers` records that satisfy both conditions defined within the `WHERE` clause.","# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols

**Explanation:**

1.  **`active_recent_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `join_date >= '2023-01-01'`: Selects customers whose `join_date` is on or after January 1, 2023.
    *   `status == 'Active'`: Selects customers whose account `status` is 'Active'.
    The result `active_recent_customers` contains only the customers meeting both criteria.

2.  **`tac_by_country = active_recent_customers.PARTITION(...)`**: This line takes the filtered customers and partitions (groups) them based on their `country`.
    *   `name=""country_group""`: Assigns a temporary name to each group created by the partition.
    *   `by=country`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values in the `country` field.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is applied to each country group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `country=country`: Selects the `country` field (which is the partition key).
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of `Customers` records within the current partition (country group). This gives the Total Active Customers (TAC) count for that specific country, considering only those who met the initial filtering criteria.

# Assign the final result to the variable 'result'
result = weekly_stock_summary
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`stock_transactions_info`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only transactions where the associated `ticker` has a `ticker_type` of 'stock'. We then use `CALCULATE` to create two new fields for each of these stock transactions:
    *   `weeks_ago_num`: This uses `DATEDIFF(""weeks"", date_time, 'now')` to determine how many full weeks have passed between the transaction's `date_time` and the current moment. A value of 1 means the transaction occurred last week, 2 means the week before, and so on.
    *   `is_weekend_flag`: This uses `DAYNAME()` to get the name of the day of the week for the `date_time` and `ISIN()` to check if that name is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". It results in a boolean value (True if weekend, False otherwise), which acts as a flag (1 if True, 0 if False when used in aggregations like SUM).

2.  **`relevant_weeks_transactions`**: We take the intermediate result `stock_transactions_info` and apply another `WHERE` clause to filter only those transactions where `weeks_ago_num` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive). This selects transactions from the 8 weeks immediately preceding the current week.

3.  **`weekly_stock_summary`**:
    *   We use `PARTITION` on the `relevant_weeks_transactions`. We group the transactions using `by=weeks_ago_num`, creating distinct groups for each of the past 8 weeks (week 1, week 2, ..., week 8). The partition is named `weekly_groups`.
    *   Following the `PARTITION`, we use `CALCULATE` to aggregate results for each group:
        *   `week_identifier=weeks_ago_num`: We select the week number itself (1 through 8).
        *   `total_stock_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: We count the total number of stock transactions belonging to that specific week's group.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions=SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_flag)`: We sum the `is_weekend_flag` calculated earlier for all transactions within the group. Since the flag is 1 for weekend days and 0 otherwise, this sum gives the count of weekend transactions for that week.
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(week_identifier.ASC())` sorts the output rows based on the week number, from 1 (most recent week) to 8 (earliest week).

4.  **`result = weekly_stock_summary`**: The final calculated and ordered weekly summary is assigned to the variable `result`.","# Step 1: Filter transactions for stocks and CALCULATE week number relative to now,

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` graph to calculate the date boundaries needed for filtering.
    *   `start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., the most recent Monday at 00:00:00).
    *   `start_of_last_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '- 7 days')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the *previous* week by taking the start of the current week and subtracting 7 days.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the boundaries defined in the first one to perform the main aggregations.
    *   **`num_transactions = COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of transactions that meet the specified criteria.
        *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(customer.country == ""USA"")`: Selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"". We access the customer information via the `customer` relationship on the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week) & (date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Filters transactions whose `date_time` falls within the last week (inclusive of the start, exclusive of the end, which is the start of the current week).
    *   **`total_transaction_amount = SUM(...)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for the same set of filtered transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This variable filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `WHERE((transaction_type == 'BUY') & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, 'now') <= 10))`: It selects only transactions where the `transaction_type` is 'BUY' and the transaction occurred within the last 10 days (inclusive) from the current time (`'now'`). `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days between the transaction `date_time` and now.
    *   `CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol)`: It retrieves the stock `symbol` from the related `ticker` for each selected transaction and assigns it to the new field `ticker_symbol`. This is needed for partitioning by symbol.

2.  **`ticker_buy_counts`**: This variable takes the filtered transactions and groups them.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""ticker_groups"", by=(ticker_symbol))`: It groups the `recent_buy_transactions` based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol`.
    *   `CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=ticker_symbol, num_buy_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (each unique `ticker_symbol`), it calculates the `ticker_symbol` itself and the total count of transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`) within that group, assigning the count to `num_buy_transactions`.

3.  **`top_2_bought_tickers`**: This variable selects the top results.
    *   `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())`: It takes the `ticker_buy_counts` and selects the top 2 rows based on the `num_buy_transactions` field in descending order (highest count first).

4.  **`result = top_2_bought_tickers`**: The final result, containing the ticker symbol and the count of buy transactions for the two most frequently bought stocks in the last 10 days, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Filter transactions to include only 'BUY' types within the last 10 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary date boundaries using the `DATETIME` function.
    *   `current_month_start`: Finds the first moment of the current month.
    *   `six_months_ago_start`: Finds the first moment of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month.
2.  **`customers_in_window = date_boundaries.Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   It selects only customers whose `join_date` falls on or after `six_months_ago_start` and strictly before `current_month_start`, effectively selecting customers from the last 6 full months.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this step prepares the data for partitioning:
    *   `signup_month_str`: Creates a string representation of the signup month in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `IFF` for zero-padding the month number. This standardized format is used for grouping.
    *   `customer_ref=Customers`: Passes the reference to the customer records themselves into the next stage, allowing aggregations like `COUNT` and `AVG` within the partition.
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""signups_per_month"", by=(signup_month_str))`**: This groups the `customers_in_window` data based on the `signup_month_str` calculated previously. Each partition represents a specific signup month within the target window.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each monthly partition (`signups_per_month`) to calculate the required metrics:
    *   `signup_month=signup_month_str`: Selects the signup month string for the output.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(signups_per_month.customer_ref)`: Calculates the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of customer records (`customer_ref`) within the current month's partition.
    *   `pmat=AVG(DEFAULT_TO(signups_per_month.customer_ref.transactions_made.amount, 0.0))`: Calculates the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT). It accesses all transactions (`transactions_made`) for all customers (`customer_ref`) within the current month's partition, takes their `amount`, and computes the average (`AVG`). `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, it contributes 0 to the average calculation rather than causing an error or null result.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results chronologically by the signup month.
7.  **`result = monthly_signup_metrics`**: Assigns the final computed table to the `result` variable.","# Define the time window boundaries: start of 6 months ago and start of the current MONTH

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Recent Prices:** We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. We use `WHERE` to filter these records, keeping only those where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') <= 6`.
2.  **Include Ticker Type and Closing Price:** Within the same step (or a subsequent `CALCULATE`), we select the `close` price (renaming it `closing_price` for clarity) and access the `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record using `ticker.ticker_type`. This creates a temporary collection `recent_price_data` containing relevant closing prices and their associated ticker types for the specified timeframe.
3.  **Partition by Ticker Type:** We then use `PARTITION` on `recent_price_data`, grouping the records by `ticker_type`. The `name=""type_groups""` assigns a temporary name to these groups, and `by=(ticker_type)` specifies the grouping key.
4.  **Calculate Average Closing Price:** Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data. For each `ticker_type` group, we output the `ticker_type` itself and compute the `average_closing_price` using the `AVG()` aggregation function on the `closing_price` field of the `DailyPrices` records belonging to that specific partition group.
5.  **Assign Result:** The final result, containing each `ticker_type` and its calculated average closing price over the last 7 days, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_joined_2022_with_tx = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`) AND have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This pre-filtered set forms the basis for our calculation, ensuring we only consider relevant customers for both the numerator and denominator of the AR.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country))`**: This partitions the filtered customers (`customers_joined_2022_with_tx`) into groups based on their `country`. Each group will contain customers from the same country who joined in 2022 and have transactions.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: This calculates values for each country group:
    *   `country_name=country`: Selects the country name (the partition key).
    *   `num_active_customers = COUNT(Customers.WHERE(status == 'Active'))`: Counts the customers *within the current country group* whose status is 'Active'. This is the numerator for the AR.
    *   `num_total_customers = COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the total number of customers *within the current country group*. Since the input to PARTITION was already filtered for customers with transactions, this count represents the denominator for the AR.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after the first CALCULATE**: This performs the final AR calculation and selects the desired output fields:
    *   `country=country_name`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio. It uses `IFF` to check if `num_total_customers` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero. If it is, it calculates `100.0 * num_active_customers / num_total_customers`; otherwise, it assigns `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` graph because we need a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`customer_count = COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `customer_count` which will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: We convert the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase using `LOWER()` to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the name criterion:
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so the customer's name must satisfy at least one of them.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
7.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name criterion and the state criterion. A customer is included only if *both* the name condition (starts with 'j' or ends with 'ez') AND the state condition (ends with 'a') are true.
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy the combined filter conditions.","result = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`one_month_ago = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`**: Defines a variable `one_month_ago` representing the timestamp exactly one month before the current time. This is used to filter transactions.
2.  **`ticker_groups = Tickers.PARTITION(name=""ticker_data"", by=(symbol))`**: Groups the `Tickers` collection by the `symbol` field. Each group (`ticker_data`) contains data for a single ticker symbol.
3.  **`ticker_aggregates = ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each ticker group:
    *   Selects the `ticker_symbol` (renamed from `symbol`).
    *   Creates a temporary filtered sub-collection `relevant_sells` containing only transactions associated with the current ticker (`ticker_data.transactions_of`) that meet the criteria: `transaction_type == 'SELL'` and occurred on or after `one_month_ago`.
    *   Calculates the sum of `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` *only* from these `relevant_sells`, storing them as `total_sell_amount`, `total_tax`, and `total_commission`.
4.  **`tickers_with_sales = ticker_aggregates.WHERE(total_sell_amount > 0)`**: Filters the results to include only those tickers where `total_sell_amount` is greater than zero, ensuring there were actual sell transactions in the period and preventing division by zero in the next step.
5.  **`result = tickers_with_sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered tickers:
    *   Selects the `ticker_symbol`.
    *   Calculates the Selling Profit Margin (`spm`) using the previously calculated aggregates and the provided formula: `(Total Amount - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a formatted month string (`month_str`) as ""YYYY-MM"" using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure the month has two digits). It also retrieves the `ticker.symbol` and keeps the relevant price fields (`close`, `high`, `low`) renaming them for clarity.
2.  **`ticker_partitions = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data by `ticker_symbol`. The result (`ticker_partitions`) is a collection where each record represents a unique ticker symbol, and associated with each record is the subset of `price_info` data belonging to that ticker (accessible via the `DailyPrices` sub-collection in the next step, inheriting the name from the original collection used in `price_info`). The partition is named `ticker_group`.
3.  **`monthly_stats_per_ticker = ticker_partitions.DailyPrices.PARTITION(...)`**: This step operates within each `ticker_group`. It accesses the `DailyPrices` sub-collection (containing the daily records for that specific ticker) and partitions *it* by the `month_str`. This creates groups for each month within each ticker. The partition is named `month_group`. Inside the `CALCULATE`, it computes the `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low` for each specific ticker-month combination by aggregating the original `DailyPrices` fields within that `month_group`.
4.  **`final_result = monthly_stats_per_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step works on the collection of monthly aggregates (`monthly_stats_per_ticker`).
    *   It retrieves `ticker_symbol` from the ancestor `ticker_group` partition context.
    *   It uses the `PREV` window function to get the `avg_close` from the *previous* record within the same ticker group. `by=month.ASC()` specifies the ordering for `PREV`, and `per=""ticker_group""` ensures it looks back only within the records of the same ticker. `default=None` handles the first month of each ticker gracefully.
    *   It calculates `momc` using the formula `(current - previous) / previous`. The `IFF` function prevents division-by-zero errors and handles the `None` case for the first month by setting `momc` to `None`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A final `CALCULATE` selects only the requested columns: `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, and the calculated `momc`.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Sorts the final output alphabetically by ticker symbol and then chronologically by month.","# Step 1: Prepare daily price data by calculating the MONTH string (YYYY-MM) and retrieving the ticker symbol.

It also keeps the customer's `_id` and `name` by assigning them to new variables `cust_id` and `cust_name`.
2.  **`customer_txn_counts = customer_join_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step builds upon the previous one. For each customer (now with their `join_month` and `join_year` available), it accesses their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   It filters these transactions using `.WHERE()` to keep only those where the transaction's `date_time` month and year match the customer's `join_month` and `join_year` (which were calculated in the previous step and are available via down-streaming).
    *   It then uses `COUNT()` to count how many transactions remain after filtering for that specific customer. This count is stored in `num_transactions_join_month`.
    *   The `cust_id` and `cust_name` are carried forward.
3.  **`top_customer = customer_txn_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: This step takes the results (one row per customer with their respective transaction count) and selects the single customer with the highest `num_transactions_join_month`.
    *   `TOP_K(1, ...)` selects the top 1 record.

**Explanation:**

    *   Calculate the total number of transactions (`num_transactions`) belonging to that specific status using the `COUNT(Transactions)` aggregation function.
4.  Finally, it applies `TOP_K(3, by=num_transactions.DESC())` to the result of the partition. This selects the 3 status groups that have the highest `num_transactions`, ordered from highest to lowest count.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 most frequent combinations of customer state and ticker type based on the number of transactions.
2.  **Data Needed:**
    *   Customer state (from `Customers` via `Transactions`)
    *   Ticker type (from `Tickers` via `Transactions`)
    *   Transaction count for each combination.
3.  **Core Collection:** `Transactions` is the central collection linking customers and tickers.
4.  **Steps:**
    *   Start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, extract the `customer.state` and `ticker.ticker_type`. Use `CALCULATE` to make these accessible.
    *   Group (partition) the transactions by the extracted `customer_state` and `ticker_type`.
    *   For each group (combination), count the number of transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   Select the top 5 groups based on the transaction count in descending order using `TOP_K`.
    *   Return the `customer_state`, `ticker_type`, and the `transaction_count`.

**PyDough Code:**

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we use `CALCULATE` to create two new fields: `customer_state` (by accessing the `state` of the linked `customer`) and `ticker_type` (by accessing the `ticker_type` of the linked `ticker`).
2.  **`state_ticker_groups = transaction_details.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition the `transaction_details` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups the records based on the unique combinations specified in the `by` parameter, which are `customer_state` and `ticker_type`. Each group is conceptually named ""combinations"".
3.  **`top_combinations = state_ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...).TOP_K(...)`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the result of the partition (`state_ticker_groups`).
    *   Inside `CALCULATE`, we select the partitioning keys (`customer_state`, `ticker_type`) to include them in the output.
    *   We calculate `transaction_count` by using the `COUNT(Transactions)` aggregation function, which counts the number of original transaction records within each partition group (i.e., for each state/type combination).
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=transaction_count.DESC())` selects the 5 groups (combinations) with the highest `transaction_count`, ordered from highest to lowest count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Transactions` collection and calculates a new field `sender_country`. It uses the `IFF` function to check the `sender_type`: if it's 1 (User), it takes the country from the linked `sending_user`; otherwise (if it's 2, Merchant), it takes the country from the linked `sending_merchant`. It also retains the `created_at` and `amount` fields for subsequent filtering and aggregation.
2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 30)`**: This filters the `transaction_info` collection to include only transactions where the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. This effectively selects transactions from the past 30 days, inclusive of the 30th day ago.
3.  **`transaction_info.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=sender_country)`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on the calculated `sender_country`. Each partition (`country_groups`) contains all transactions from a specific country within the last 30 days.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition (each country group).
    *   `country_name = sender_country`: Selects the country name, which is the key used for partitioning.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within the current country group (partition).
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within the current country group.
5.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` (one row per country with its stats) and selects the top 5 rows based on the `total_transaction_amount`, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC`).
6.  **`result = top_countries_by_amount`**: The final result, containing the top 5 countries with their name, transaction count, and total transaction amount for the last 30 days, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE sender country for each transaction and filter by date

2.  **`num_transactions=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_transactions` which will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Users` collection and filter it.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70`**: This is the filter condition.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions:**
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   `status == 'Completed'`: Selects only transactions marked as 'Completed'. We assume 'Completed' signifies a successful transaction as per the schema examples.
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
        *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions where the month is January (1), February (2), or March (3), covering the first quarter.
2.  **Extract Month:**
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` creates a new field `transaction_month`.
    *   `JOIN_STRINGS` combines the `YEAR` and `MONTH` extracted from `date_time`, separated by a hyphen (`-`).
    *   `LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")` ensures the month is always two digits (e.g., '01', '02', '03'), which helps with correct sorting later. The result is a string like ""2023-01"".
3.  **Partition by Month:**
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(transaction_month))` groups the filtered transactions based on the unique values of the `transaction_month` field created earlier. Each group represents a specific month in Q1 2023.
4.  **Calculate Average Amount:**
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on each monthly group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month identifier for the output.
    *   `avg_monthly_amount = AVG(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the average of the `amount` field for all transactions *within that specific monthly group*. We use `Transactions.amount` here because, within the context of the partition's `CALCULATE`, we need to refer back to the original collection (`Transactions`) to aggregate its fields. We assume ""transaction price"" refers to the total `amount` of the transaction, not the `price` per share/unit field.
5.  **Order Results:**
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the final results chronologically based on the `month` string (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02"", ""2023-03"").
6.  **Final Assignment:**
    *   `result = monthly_average_amounts` assigns the computed table (containing month and average amount for each month in Q1 2023) to the `result` variable.","# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and 'Completed' status, extracting year-MONTH

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the time boundaries using `Dealership.CALCULATE`. `start_of_current_week` is the beginning of the current week, and `start_of_target_period` is the beginning of the week 8 weeks prior. This defines our 8-week window *before* the current week.
2.  **`high_value_sales`**: We filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
3.  **`payments_in_period`**: We navigate from the filtered `high_value_sales` to their associated `payment` records. We then filter these payments using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `payment_date` falls within our calculated 8-week window (`>= start_of_target_period` and `< start_of_current_week`). In the `CALCULATE` step, we determine the `week_start_dt` for each payment using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')` and a boolean flag `is_weekend_payment` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
4.  **`weekly_payment_groups`**: We use `PARTITION` to group the `payments_in_period` by their `week_start_dt`. Within the `CALCULATE` clause for each partition group:
    *   `week=week_start_dt`: We assign the partition key (the week's start date) to the output field `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: We count all payments belonging to that specific week group.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.is_weekend_payment)`: We sum the `is_weekend_payment` boolean flag (treating True as 1 and False as 0) for all payments within the group to get the count of weekend payments.
5.  **`result`**: Finally, we take the `weekly_payment_groups` and use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the results chronologically by the week's start date. The final `CALCULATE` in the previous step ensures we only output the requested fields: `week`, `total_payments_received`, and `weekend_payments_received`.","# Define the time boundaries for the last 8 full weeks before the current week

3.  **`num_sales_last_30_days=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate the number of recent sales for each salesperson.
4.  **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` collection) for the current salesperson and filter these sales using `WHERE`.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`**: This is the filtering condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`car_info = Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by creating uppercase versions of `make`, `model`, and `vin_number` using the `UPPER()` function. This allows for case-insensitive comparisons and grouping later.
2.  **`filtered_cars = car_info.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `car_info` collection.
    *   `LIKE(uc_vin, '%M5%')`: This checks if the uppercase VIN (`uc_vin`) contains the substring 'M5'. The `%` are wildcards, matching any sequence of characters.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one associated sales record.
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions with a logical AND.
3.  **`sales_by_model = filtered_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_cars` based on the combination of uppercase make (`uc_make`) and uppercase model (`uc_model`). This groups cars with the same make and model together, ignoring case differences.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each partition (group of make/model):
    *   `car_make=uc_make`: Selects the uppercase make (which is a partition key).
    *   `car_model=uc_model`: Selects the uppercase model (which is a partition key).
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of sales records associated with all cars belonging to the current make/model partition group that passed the initial VIN filter. We use `Cars.sale_records` here to refer back to the original collection context within the partition to count the related sales.
5.  **`result = sales_by_model`**: The final result, containing the make, model, and total number of sales for each group matching the criteria, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE uppercase fields for case-insensitive matching and filtering

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Sales` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: It accesses the related `car` record for each sale and checks if its `make` field is exactly ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30`: It calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition `<= 30` ensures that only sales from today and the preceding 30 days are included.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations at the top `Dealership` level to get aggregate results from the filtered sales:
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales)`: It counts the number of records in the `recent_toyota_sales` collection (which contains only the filtered sales) and assigns the count to the `number_of_sales` field.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales.sale_price)`: It sums the `sale_price` field for all records in the `recent_toyota_sales` collection and assigns the total sum to the `total_revenue` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_stats = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute aggregated statistics for each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount by summing the `sale_price` from all associated sales records (`sales_made` sub-collection). `SUM` is used because `sales_made` is a plural sub-collection.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales records associated with each salesperson using the `COUNT` aggregation function.

2.  **`salesperson_ranked_sales = salesperson_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Takes the results from the previous step (`salesperson_stats`).
    *   Uses another `CALCULATE` to select the final required fields and compute the rank.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`, `total_sales_amount=total_sales_amount`, `num_sales=num_sales`: Selects the previously calculated fields, renaming `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name` back to the requested names.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `salesperson_stats` collection, ordering the salespersons based on their `total_sales_amount` in descending order (highest sales get rank 1).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_cars = Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and calculate several intermediate fields for each car:
    *   `car_make=make`, `car_model=model`: Select the make and model.
    *   `latest_snapshot=...`: This finds the most recent inventory snapshot for each car. It uses `RANKING` on `snapshot_date` descending within the `inventory_snapshots` of each car (`per=""Cars""`). `allow_ties=True` handles cases with multiple snapshots on the same latest date. `.SINGULAR()` assumes there's effectively one latest status per car after ranking.
    *   `is_not_in_inventory=...`: This checks if the `is_in_inventory` field of the `latest_snapshot` is `False`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., True)` handles cars with no inventory snapshots; we assume they *are* in inventory (True) so they get filtered out unless the latest snapshot explicitly says `False`.
    *   `has_sales=...`: Checks if the car has at least one entry in its `sale_records` using `HAS`.
2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the `relevant_cars` to keep only those where `is_not_in_inventory` is `True` (meaning the latest status was `False`) AND `has_sales` is `True`.
3.  **`make_model_max_prices = relevant_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: Partitions the filtered cars into groups based on their `car_make` and `car_model`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each `make`/`model` group created by the partition:
    *   `make=car_make`, `model=car_model`: Selects the make and model for the output.
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the maximum `sale_price` by looking at all `sale_records` associated with the cars belonging to the current `make`/`model` partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_constants`**: We first define the date boundaries using `DATETIME('now', ...)` to get the start of the current month and the start of the month 6 months prior. This makes the date range dynamic.
2.  **`all_sales_in_period_with_month`**: We filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within our defined 6-month period (`>= start_of_period` and `< start_of_current_month`). We then use `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month` field in 'YYYY-MM' format (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and assuming `LPAD` for zero-padding the month) for easy grouping.
3.  **`all_monthly_groups`**: We partition these filtered sales using `PARTITION` based on the `sale_month`. This groups all sales from the period by the month they occurred in.
4.  **`monthly_metrics`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `sale_month` group:
    *   `pmsps` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count): We count the number of `Sales` records *within that month's group* but apply an additional `WHERE` clause inside the `COUNT` to only include sales made by `salesperson` whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023.
    *   `pmsr` (Per Month Sales Revenue): Similarly, we sum the `sale_price` of `Sales` records *within that month's group*, again applying the `WHERE` clause inside `SUM` to filter for the target salespersons. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if no sales match the criteria in a given month (resulting in a null sum), we output 0.0 instead.
5.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` to sort the monthly results chronologically.

This query structure ensures that we consider all months within the 6-month period *that had at least one sale* (regardless of salesperson). The filtering for the specific salespersons happens *during* the aggregation step for each month, correctly calculating PMSPS and PMSR based only on their contributions and yielding 0 if they had no sales in a month that otherwise had activity. Months with *zero* sales overall in the period will not be represented, as partitioning relies on existing data.","# Define the time range constants: start of the current MONTH and start of the 6-MONTH period prior.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_lag = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, it calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` (accessed through the `sale_record` relationship to the `Sales` collection) and the `payment_date` of the payment itself using the `DATEDIFF` function.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph because we need an overall aggregate (total revenue and total cost) across multiple sales records.
2.  **`total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`**: This calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all records in the `Sales` collection where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.
3.  **`total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`**: This calculates the sum of the `cost` for all cars associated (`car` relationship) with the sales records filtered for the year 2023.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the GPM based on the previously calculated totals.
5.  **`gpm_2023 = IFF(...)`**: This calculates the Gross Profit Margin.
    *   **`total_cost_2023 != 0`**: It first checks if the `total_cost_2023` is not zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   **`(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`**: If the cost is not zero, it applies the GPM formula: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost, multiplied by 100.0 (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division for a percentage result).
    *   **`0.0`**: If the total cost *is* zero, the GPM is assigned as 0.0.

2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if the car associated with the current sale (`car`) has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) inventory snapshot record (`inventory_snapshots`) that meets the inner `WHERE` conditions.
3.  **`(snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False)`**: This inner condition filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the specific car.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, it extracts the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` and keeps the `payment_amount`. These calculated fields (`pay_year`, `pay_month`, `pay_amount`) are added to each record.
2.  **`monthly_groups = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `payment_info` data into groups based on unique combinations of `pay_year` and `pay_month`. Each group represents a specific month and contains all payment records from that month. The partition is named ""months"".
3.  **`monthly_analysis = monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each monthly group created by the partition.
    *   `year=pay_year, month=pay_month`: Selects the year and month identifiers for the group.
    *   `total_received=SUM(months.pay_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `pay_amount` for all records within the current month's group (`months`). This gives the total payments received for that month.
    *   `mom_change=SUM(months.pay_amount) - PREV(...)`: Calculates the month-over-month change.
        *   `SUM(months.pay_amount)`: This is the total received for the *current* month.
        *   `PREV(SUM(months.pay_amount), by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC()), default=0.0)`: This retrieves the `total_received` (represented again by `SUM(months.pay_amount)` in the context of the `PREV` function's expression) from the *previous* month's aggregated row.
        *   `by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())`: This tells `PREV` how to order the aggregated monthly rows to determine which one is ""previous"" – chronologically by year, then month.
        *   `default=0.0`: If there is no previous month (i.e., for the earliest month in the data), `PREV` will return `0.0`. This ensures the MoM calculation doesn't fail and the change for the first month is simply its total amount.
4.  **`result = monthly_analysis.ORDER_BY(...)`**: This final step sorts the calculated monthly results chronologically, first by `year` in ascending order and then by `month` in ascending order, before assigning it to the `result` variable.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection, as we want to find information *about* salespersons.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new values and select specific fields for each salesperson.
    *   `salesperson_id=_id`: Selects the unique identifier (`_id`) and names it `salesperson_id`.
    *   `first_name=first_name`: Selects the `first_name`.
    *   `last_name=last_name`: Selects the `last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson. It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` records for that salesperson) and sums up the `sale_price` for all those sales. The result is named `total_sales_amount`.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function selects the top 5 records from the result of the `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Specifies the sorting criteria. It sorts the salespersons based on the calculated `total_sales_amount` in descending order (`DESC`), meaning the highest sales amounts come first. `na_pos='last'` ensures that any salespersons with a NULL or undefined `total_sales_amount` are placed at the end of the sorted list, effectively excluding them from the top results unless there are fewer than 5 non-null results.","# CALCULATE the total sales amount for each salesperson and select the top 5

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HASNOT(sale_records)` function, which returns `True` (or 1 in PyDough comparison) if the `sale_records` sub-collection for a given car is empty, meaning the car has never been sold.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**: For the cars that satisfy the `WHERE` condition (i.e., have no sales records), this `CALCULATE` clause selects and renames the required fields: `_id` (as `car_id`), `make` (as `car_make`), `model` (as `car_model`), and `year` (as `car_year`).

This query effectively performs the equivalent of a left join where the right side (sales) is null, identifying cars without any corresponding sales entries.","# Find cars that have no associated sales records

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers`**: We start with the `Customers` collection, which contains all customer records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`**: This filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `car_purchases` is the sub-collection linking a customer to their sales records (as defined in the schema: `Customers.car_purchases` is the reverse of `Sales.customer`).
    *   `HAS(car_purchases)` checks if a customer has one or more entries in their `car_purchases` list.
    *   `== 1` ensures we only keep customers for whom `HAS(car_purchases)` is true (meaning they have made at least one purchase/sale).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: This selects the desired field from the filtered customers.
    *   It takes the `_id` field (the unique identifier for each customer).
    *   It renames this field to `customer_id` in the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it based on a condition.
2.  **`HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with each salesperson.
    *   `payment`: Accesses the list of payments associated with each of those sales.
    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')`: Filters these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is 'Cash'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if *at least one* such cash payment exists for any sale made by the salesperson. If a salesperson has made any sale that received a cash payment, this condition evaluates to true for that salesperson.
3.  **`cash_payment_salespersons.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = _id)`**: From the filtered list of salespersons (those who have received at least one cash payment for a sale they made), we select only their unique identifier (`_id`) and rename it to `salesperson_id`. Since the filtering happens at the `Salespersons` level, the resulting IDs are inherently distinct.","# Find salespersons who have at least one sale associated with a cash payment

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `sp_first_name`: Their first name.
    *   `sp_last_name`: Their last name.
    *   `recent_sales_count`: We access their `sales_made` sub-collection, filter it to include only sales where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30, and then count the remaining sales records using `COUNT()`.
    *   `recent_revenue`: Similarly, we filter `sales_made` for the last 30 days and then calculate the sum of the `sale_price` for those sales using `SUM()`.
2.  **`.WHERE(recent_sales_count > 0)`**: We filter the results to include only those salespersons who made at least one sale in the last 30 days.
3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=recent_sales_count.DESC())`**: We select the top 5 salespersons based on the `recent_sales_count` in descending order (highest count first).

We use `DEFAULT_TO(recent_revenue, 0.0)` as a safeguard to ensure the revenue is represented as 0 if a salesperson somehow had 0 sales but wasn't filtered out (though the preceding `WHERE` clause should prevent this).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This defines a contextless expression to calculate the date exactly 3 months before the current time (`now`). This makes the subsequent code cleaner.
2.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to compute new fields for each salesperson.
3.  **`rep_first_name=first_name, rep_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid potential conflicts in later steps.
4.  **`total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`**: This calculates the total revenue for each salesperson.
    *   It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` table).
    *   It filters these sales using `WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago)` to include only sales made within the last 3 months.
    *   It then sums the `sale_price` of these filtered sales using `SUM()`.
5.  **`total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`**: This counts the number of sales for each salesperson within the same 3-month period.
    *   It accesses `sales_made` and applies the same date filter.
    *   `COUNT()` counts the number of sales records that meet the date criteria.
6.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 3 salespersons based on their calculated `total_revenue`, sorting in descending order.
7.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to exactly match the requested output format: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales`, and `total_revenue`.","# Define the start date for the 3-MONTH window (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(termination_date) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is present (not null). This ensures we only consider salespersons who have actually been terminated.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates new fields for the filtered salespersons:

    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the `phone` number.
    *   `employment_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date` in days, representing the duration of employment.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_days.ASC())`**: This selects the single record (`k=1`) with the minimum value for the calculated `employment_days` field, effectively finding the salesperson with the shortest employment duration among those terminated.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph because we want to calculate a single aggregated value for the entire dataset.
2.  **`num_payments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_payments` which will hold the result of the count.
3.  **`PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsMade` collection and apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters the payments to include only those made to the vendor named 'Utility Company'.
5.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`**: This condition checks if the payment date falls on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` checks if the extracted day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
6.  **`&`**: The ampersand operator combines the two conditions, ensuring that only payments meeting *both* criteria (to 'Utility Company' *and* on a weekend) are included.
7.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the number of records in the `PaymentsMade` collection that satisfy the combined filter conditions.

3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_in_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered payments.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  The code first filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is within the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
2.  It then uses `CALCULATE` to extract or derive necessary fields for each sale:
    *   `cust_state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale via `customer.state`.
    *   `sale_month`: Extracts the month from the `sale_date` using `MONTH()`.
    *   `sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price`.
    *   `quarter_start`: Calculates the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions based on the `sale_month` and the `DATETIME` function. `DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of year')` gets the first day of the year, and modifiers like `'+3 months'` are added to get the start dates for Q2, Q3, and Q4 (2023-04-01, 2023-07-01, 2023-10-01 respectively).
3.  The resulting collection (`sales_info`) is then partitioned using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_groups""` assigns a name to the partition groups (though not strictly needed for the final calculation here).
    *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start)` specifies that the sales records should be grouped based on the unique combinations of the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  Finally, another `CALCULATE` is applied to the partitioned data:
    *   It selects the partition keys `cust_state` (renamed to `customer_state`) and `quarter_start` (renamed to `quarter_start_date`).
    *   It calculates `total_quarterly_sales` by applying the `SUM()` aggregation function to the `sale_price` of all `Sales` records that fall into each specific state/quarter group.

The final result (`quarterly_sales_by_state`) contains one record for each state and quarter combination in 2023, showing the state, the first date of the quarter, and the total sales amount for that group.","# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023 and CALCULATE necessary fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_with_ddd` Calculation:**
    *   We start with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters treatments to include only those with a non-null `end_dt`, as required by the DDD definition (duration calculation needs an end date).
    *   `CALCULATE(duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt), drug_id=drug_id)`: Calculates the duration of each treatment in days and keeps the `drug_id` for later grouping.
    *   `WHERE(duration_days > 0)`: Filters out treatments where the duration is zero or negative (e.g., start and end date are the same), preventing division by zero and ensuring meaningful DDD values.
    *   `CALCULATE(ddd_value=tot_drug_amt / duration_days, drug_id=drug_id)`: Calculates the DDD for each valid treatment by dividing the `tot_drug_amt` by the calculated `duration_days`. We retain `drug_id` again.

2.  **`avg_ddd_per_drug` Calculation:**
    *   `Drugs.PARTITION(...)`: We start from the `Drugs` collection and use `PARTITION` to group the results.
    *   `treatments_with_ddd`: We provide the previously calculated `treatments_with_ddd` collection as the data to be partitioned.
    *   `name=""drug_treatments""`: Assigns a name to the partitioned groups within the context.
    *   `by=(drug_id)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the `drug_id`. This effectively groups all the calculated DDD values belonging to the same drug.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each drug group created by the partition:
        *   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the `drug_name` from the `Drugs` collection context (since we started the partition from `Drugs`).
        *   `average_ddd=AVG(drug_treatments.ddd_value)`: Calculates the average DDD for the current drug by averaging the `ddd_value` from all treatments belonging to this drug group (accessed via the partition name `drug_treatments`).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(drug_name.ASC())`: Sorts the final result alphabetically by drug name (this part is optional but good practice).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the start date of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the start date of the month three months prior (`three_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function. This defines the time window for our analysis (the last three full months).
2.  **`treatment_info`**: We access the `Treatments` collection through `date_boundaries` to use the calculated dates.
    *   We filter treatments using `WHERE` to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated three-month window (`>= three_months_ago_start` and `< current_month_start`).
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, we extract:
        *   `treatment_month`: Formatted as 'YYYY-MM' using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent sorting and display.
        *   `patient_id`: The ID of the patient receiving the treatment.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag set to `True` if the treatment's associated drug (`drug.drug_type`) is 'biologic'.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: We partition the `treatment_info` collection by the `treatment_month` using `PARTITION`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month together.
4.  **`result`**: We perform calculations on each monthly group:
    *   `month = treatment_month`: We select the month identifier.
    *   `patient_count = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: We count the number of unique `patient_id`s within the `Treatments` sub-collection of the current month's partition. This gives the total distinct patients treated in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count = NDISTINCT(Treatments.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment == True).patient_id)`: We first filter the `Treatments` sub-collection within the partition to include only those where `is_biologic_treatment` is `True`, and *then* count the distinct `patient_id`s from this filtered subset. This gives the count of distinct patients receiving biologic treatments in that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to calculate a single aggregate value for the entire dataset.
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_patients` which will hold the result of the count.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it based on a condition.
4.  **`ENDSWITH(email, '@gmail.com') | ENDSWITH(email, '@yahoo.com')`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, '@gmail.com')` checks if the `email` field ends with '@gmail.com'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, '@yahoo.com')` checks if the `email` field ends with '@yahoo.com'.
    *   The `|` operator represents a logical OR, so the condition is true if the email ends with *either* '@gmail.com' *or* '@yahoo.com'.
5.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of patients remaining after the `WHERE` filter is applied.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Patients` collection.
2.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition. We use `HAS` to check if a patient has *at least one* record in their `treatments_received` sub-collection that meets the criteria specified in the nested `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`treatments_received.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))`**: Inside the `HAS` function, we filter the `treatments_received` for each patient. A treatment is kept only if *both* conditions are true for that specific treatment:
    *   `diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris'`: The diagnosis associated with the treatment has the name 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
    *   `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`: The drug used in the treatment has the type 'biologic'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates for our desired period at the top level (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `start_period=DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the month that started exactly 6 months before the current month. For example, if today is August 15th, 2024, this would calculate February 1st, 2024.
    *   `start_of_current_month=DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the current month. For example, if today is August 15th, 2024, this would calculate August 1st, 2024.
2.  **`alice_treatments_in_period = date_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection via the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_period` and `start_of_current_month` available). We then filter these treatments based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `patient.first_name == ""Alice""`: Filters for treatments associated with a patient whose first name is ""Alice"".
    *   `start_dt >= start_period`: Ensures the treatment's start date (`start_dt`) is on or after the beginning of the 6-month lookback period.
    *   `start_dt < start_of_current_month`: Ensures the treatment's start date is before the beginning of the current month, effectively excluding the current month.
3.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we perform a calculation at the top `DermTreatment` level.
    *   `alice_treatment_count_last_6_months=COUNT(alice_treatments_in_period)`: We use the `COUNT` aggregation function on the previously filtered `alice_treatments_in_period` collection to get the total number of treatments that met all the criteria.

1.  **Goal:** We need to get information for each doctor: `doc_id`, `speciality`, the count of unique drugs they prescribed, and their rank (`SDR`) within their specialty based on that count.
2.  **Data Needed:**
    *   From `Doctors`: `doc_id`, `speciality`.
    *   From `Doctors.prescribed_treatments`: We need to access the associated `drug` for each treatment.
    *   From `Doctors.prescribed_treatments.drug`: We need the `drug_id` to count distinct drugs.
3.  **Calculations:**
    *   Count distinct `drug_id`s for each doctor via their `prescribed_treatments`.
    *   Rank doctors *within* each `speciality` based on the distinct drug count (descending).
4.  **PyDough Strategy:**
    *   Since we need to rank *within* a group (specialty), `PARTITION` by `speciality` seems appropriate. This creates groups for each specialty.
    *   Inside each specialty partition, we can access the `Doctors` belonging to that specialty.
    *   For each doctor in the partition, calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed using `NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`.
    *   Use the `RANKING` window function with `per=""specialty_group""` (the partition name) to rank doctors based on the calculated distinct drug count.

```python
# Partition doctors by their specialty
specialty_groups = Doctors.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(speciality))

# Access doctors within each specialty group and calculate distinct drug counts
doctors_in_specialty = specialty_groups.Doctors.CALCULATE(
    doc_id=doc_id,
    speciality=speciality,  # 'speciality' is available as it's a partition key
    num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)

    num_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs,
    SDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_group"") # Rank within the partition
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(speciality))`**: This groups the `Doctors` collection by their `speciality`. Each group is named `specialty_group`.
2.  **`.Doctors`**: After partitioning, we access the `Doctors` sub-collection *within* each `specialty_group`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: For each doctor within their specialty group, we calculate:
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `speciality=speciality`: Selects the specialty (available because it was used in `by`).
    *   `num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: Counts the number of unique `drug_id`s found by navigating through the doctor's `prescribed_treatments` to the linked `drug`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: We take the results from the previous step and apply the ranking:
    *   We keep `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`.
    *   `SDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_group"")`: This calculates the rank (`SDR`) for each doctor.
        *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: Ranking is based on the `num_distinct_drugs` calculated earlier, in descending order (higher count gets rank 1).
        *   `per=""specialty_group""`: Crucially, this ensures the ranking is performed *independently within each specialty group* created by the `PARTITION`.","# PARTITION doctors by their specialty

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `DermTreatment` level to calculate two constants using the `DATETIME` function:
    *   `current_month_start`: The first moment of the current month.
    *   `start_period`: The first moment of the month that was exactly 12 months before the current month.
2.  **`monthly_treatments_info = time_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to keep only treatments whose `start_dt` falls within our desired range: greater than or equal to `start_period` and strictly less than `current_month_start`. This effectively selects treatments from the last 12 full months, excluding the current month.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_month=...)`**: For the filtered treatments, we calculate a `treatment_month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format. This standard format ensures correct grouping and sorting later. `LPAD` is used to ensure the month part always has two digits (e.g., '01', '02', ..., '12').
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(treatment_month))`**: We partition the `monthly_treatments_info` collection into groups based on the calculated `treatment_month`. Each group contains all treatments that started in that specific month.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we perform calculations for each `monthly_group`:
    *   `treatment_month=treatment_month`: We include the month identifier in the output.
    *   `PMPD=NDISTINCT(Treatments.diagnosis.diag_id)`: We calculate the ""Per Month Patient Diagnoses"" (PMPD) by counting the number of *distinct* diagnosis IDs (`diag_id`) associated with the treatments (`Treatments`) within that month's partition group.
    *   `PMTC=COUNT(Treatments)`: We calculate the ""Per Month Treatment Count"" (PMTC) by simply counting the total number of treatments (`Treatments`) within that month's partition group.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(treatment_month.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting monthly statistics in ascending chronological order based on the `treatment_month`.

What is the CAW for male patientsCAW = cohort average weight in kilograms,SELECT AVG(weight_kg) AS caw FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male';,DermTreatment,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the average weight in kilograms for a specific group (cohort) of patients.
2.  **Cohort Definition:** The cohort is defined as ""male patients"".
3.  **Value to Average:** The weight in kilograms (`weight_kg`).
4.  **Relevant Collection:** `Patients` (contains `gender` and `weight_kg`).
5.  **Operation:** Filter `Patients` by `gender == 'Male'` and then calculate the average (`AVG`) of their `weight_kg`.
6.  **Output:** A single value representing this average, named according to the definition (CAW).

**PyDough Code Generation:**

We need to filter the `Patients` collection for males and then calculate the average of their `weight_kg`. Since we want a single aggregate value for the entire cohort, we'll use `CALCULATE` at the top level (`DermTreatment`).

```python
# Calculate the Cohort Average Weight (CAW) in kilograms for male patients
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    caw_male_patients = AVG(Patients.WHERE(gender == 'Male').weight_kg)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts the calculation at the top level of the graph, indicating we want a single result summarizing data across the database.
2.  `caw_male_patients = ...`: This defines the output field name for the calculated average weight, following the requested ""CAW"" definition.
3.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the expression provided inside it.
4.  `Patients.WHERE(gender == 'Male')`: This filters the `Patients` collection to include only those records where the `gender` field is equal to 'Male'.
5.  `.weight_kg`: This selects the `weight_kg` field from the filtered male patients.
6.  The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `weight_kg` values, yielding the Cohort Average Weight for male patients.","# CALCULATE the Cohort Average Weight (CAW) in kilograms for male patients

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`first_treatments`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection. Using `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Patients"") == 1`, we identify the earliest treatment (`start_dt`) for each unique patient (`per=""Patients""`). We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `YEAR` from the `start_dt` of these first treatments, naming it `first_treatment_year`.
2.  **`new_patients_per_year`**: We take the `first_treatments` results and `PARTITION` them by the `first_treatment_year`. This groups all the first treatments that occurred in the same year. Inside the `CALCULATE` for this partition, we select the `year` (which is the `first_treatment_year` partition key) and calculate `num_new_patients` by using `COUNT(Treatments)`. Since we are operating on the partitioned collection of *first treatments*, this count effectively gives us the number of patients whose *first* treatment occurred in that specific year (i.e., the number of new patients for that year).
3.  **`result`**: We take the `new_patients_per_year` results and first `ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` to ensure the years are sequential. Then, in the final `CALCULATE`, we select the `year` and `num_new_patients`. We calculate the `npi` (New Patient Increase) by subtracting the previous year's `num_new_patients` from the current year's count. The `PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)` function retrieves the `num_new_patients` value from the preceding row (ordered by year). We provide `default=0` so that for the earliest year in the dataset (which has no preceding year), the NPI calculation effectively becomes `num_new_patients - 0`.","# Step 1: Identify the first treatment for each patient using RANKING

**Explanation:**

1.  **`pir_calculation = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph. The first `CALCULATE` computes the necessary average PASI scores.
2.  **`avg_pasi_d7=AVG(Outcomes.WHERE(...).day7_pasi_score)`**: This calculates the average `day7_pasi_score`.
    *   `Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))` filters the `Outcomes` collection to include only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null, as required by the definition.
    *   `AVG(...)` computes the average of the `day7_pasi_score` for these filtered records.
3.  **`avg_pasi_d100=AVG(Outcomes.WHERE(...).day100_pasi_score)`**: Similarly, this calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` using the same filtered set of outcome records.
4.  **`result = pir_calculation.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` takes the computed averages (`avg_pasi_d7`, `avg_pasi_d100`) and applies the D7D100PIR formula.
5.  **`D7D100PIR_percentage=IFF(...)`**: This calculates the final percentage.
    *   `IFF(avg_pasi_d7 != 0, ..., None)` checks if the average day 7 PASI score is non-zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   If `avg_pasi_d7` is not zero, it calculates `(avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0` according to the provided formula. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point division and get a percentage.
    *   If `avg_pasi_d7` is zero, it returns `None`.

4.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it using the `WHERE` clause.
5.  **`(gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: This is the filtering condition. It selects patients where the `gender` field is exactly 'Female' AND (`&`) the `ins_type` field is exactly 'Private'.
6.  The `COUNT` function then counts how many patients satisfy both conditions, and this count is assigned to the `PIC` field in the final result.","result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`drug_event_counts = Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection and calculate a new field `relevant_event_count` for each drug.
2.  **`SUM(...)`**: This function aggregates the counts from the inner calculation across all treatments associated with the current drug.
3.  **`treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each treatment linked to the drug (`treatments_used_in`), we calculate:
    *   `treatment_start_yr`: The year of the treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   `treatment_start_mo`: The month of the treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   `num_events_this_treatment`: The count of adverse events for *this specific treatment*.
4.  **`COUNT(adverse_events.WHERE(...))`**: Inside the treatment calculation, we access the `adverse_events` linked to that treatment. We filter these events using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `reported_dt`'s year and month match the `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mo` calculated just above. `COUNT` then counts how many such events exist for the current treatment.
5.  **`).num_events_this_treatment`**: After the inner `CALCULATE` determines the count for one treatment, we access this value (`num_events_this_treatment`) so the outer `SUM` can aggregate it.
6.  **`top_drug_by_adverse_events = drug_event_counts.WHERE(...)`**: We take the results from the first step (`drug_event_counts`).
7.  **`.WHERE(relevant_event_count > 0)`**: We filter out any drugs that had zero relevant adverse events.
8.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=relevant_event_count.DESC())`**: We select the top 1 drug based on the calculated `relevant_event_count` in descending order.
9.  **`.CALCULATE(drug_id=d_id, drug_name=d_name, num_adverse_events=relevant_event_count)`**: Finally, we select and rename the required output fields: the drug's ID, name, and the calculated count of relevant adverse events.","# CALCULATE the count of adverse events reported in the same MONTH/year as the treatment start date for each drug

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_patients = Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Patients` collection to include only those who have received at least one treatment (`treatments_received`) that ended (`end_dt`) in the year 2022 (`YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`). The `HAS(...) == 1` condition ensures we only consider patients with relevant treatments.
2.  **`insurance_groups = relevant_patients.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered `relevant_patients` into groups based on their `ins_type`. Each partition (`ins_groups`) represents a unique insurance type.
3.  **`insurance_stats = insurance_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each insurance type group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `insurance_type = ins_type`: We select the insurance type itself.
    *   `avg_pasi_100 = AVG(...)`: We calculate the average `day100_pasi_score` from the `outcome_records` associated with the `treatments_received` by the `Patients` *within the current partition group*, but only considering treatments that ended in 2022. The `AVG` function aggregates the scores across all relevant treatments for patients in that insurance group.
    *   `distinct_patient_count = COUNT(Patients)`: Since we partitioned the `Patients` collection, `COUNT(Patients)` within the `CALCULATE` context gives the number of unique patients belonging to the current insurance type partition group.
4.  **`top_5_ins_types_by_pasi = insurance_stats.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_100.ASC())`**: We select the top 5 resulting rows (representing insurance types) based on the calculated `avg_pasi_100`, sorting in ascending order (`ASC()`) to get the lowest scores first.
5.  **`result = top_5_ins_types_by_pasi`**: The final result, containing the top 5 insurance types with their average day 100 PASI score and distinct patient count (sorted by lowest PASI score), is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Start with Patients who have received treatments

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors`**: We start with the `Doctors` collection, which contains information about all doctors.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: We filter this collection using the `WHERE` clause. The `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1` condition checks if each doctor has at least one entry in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection. This effectively selects only those doctors who have prescribed one or more treatments.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the required fields for the doctors who passed the filter:
    *   `doctor_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's unique identifier.
    *   `doctor_first_name=first_name`: Selects the doctor's first name.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1`**: This condition checks if each patient has at least one record in the `outcome_records` sub-collection, accessed through their `treatments_received`. The `HAS` function returns true (1) if the nested collection (`outcome_records`) is not empty for any of the patient's treatments.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the required fields for the patients who met the filter condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by calculating the `start_period_date`. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` determines the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. This defines the beginning of our time window.
2.  **`recent_treatments_info = time_info.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter them using `WHERE` to include only those whose `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `start_period_date`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_specialty=doctor.speciality, drug_amount=tot_drug_amt)`**: Within the filtered treatments, we calculate two new fields: `doc_specialty` by accessing the `speciality` of the linked `doctor`, and `drug_amount` which is just the `tot_drug_amt` from the treatment record. These are needed for the subsequent partitioning and aggregation.
4.  **`specialty_stats = recent_treatments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `recent_treatments_info` collection. The `name=""spec_group""` assigns a temporary name to the groups, and `by=(doc_specialty)` groups the treatments based on the doctor's specialty calculated previously.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(specialty=doc_specialty, ...)`**: After partitioning, we perform calculations for each specialty group:
    *   `specialty=doc_specialty`: Selects the specialty name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments)`: Counts the number of treatment records within each specialty group.
    *   `total_drug_prescribed=SUM(Treatments.drug_amount)`: Sums the `drug_amount` (calculated earlier from `tot_drug_amt`) for all treatments within each specialty group.
6.  **`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount = specialty_stats.TOP_K(...)`**: We use `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_prescribed.DESC())` to select the top 3 specialty groups based on the highest `total_drug_prescribed`, sorted in descending order.
7.  **`result = top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`**: The final result, containing the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount for the top 3 specialties, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Define the start date for the period (start of the 6th MONTH before the current MONTH)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**: This groups the `Patients` collection by their `ins_type`. Each group represents a unique insurance type.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each `insurance_groups` partition (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
    *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: Selects the insurance type itself (which is the partition key).
    *   `avg_height=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: Calculates the average `height_cm` for all patients belonging to that specific insurance type group.

)

# Count the number of treatments that meet all the specified criteria
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    count_of_treatments = COUNT(recent_psoriasis_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and apply filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions inside the `WHERE` must be true (`&` operator) for a treatment to be included.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This checks the linked `diagnosis` record for each treatment. It converts the `diag_name` to lowercase using `LOWER` and then uses `LIKE` with `%` wildcards to see if it contains the substring 'psoriasis'. This ensures a case-insensitive wildcard match.
3.  **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This checks the linked `drug` record. `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt)` returns true if the `fda_appr_dt` field exists and is not null for the drug used in the treatment, indicating it has an FDA approval date.
4.  **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the treatment record actually has an end date specified.
5.  **`end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`**: This compares the treatment's `end_dt` with a date calculated dynamically. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` computes the date exactly 6 months prior to the current moment the query is run. The condition selects treatments that ended on or after that date (i.e., within the last 6 months).
6.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the `Treatments` collection into `recent_psoriasis_treatments`, we use the top-level graph `DermTreatment` to perform a final calculation.
7.  **`count_of_treatments = COUNT(recent_psoriasis_treatments)`**: This counts the number of records remaining in the filtered `recent_psoriasis_treatments` collection and assigns the result to the field `count_of_treatments`.","# Filter treatments based on diagnosis name, drug FDA approval, and end date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_registration_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`**: This line defines a contextless expression to calculate the target registration year by subtracting 2 from the current year obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`.
2.  **`doctors_registered_two_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `year_reg == target_registration_year`: Selects doctors whose registration year matches the calculated target year.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`: Ensures that only doctors who have prescribed at least one treatment are included.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: This step processes each filtered doctor.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `registration_year=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's registration year.
    *   `first_treatment_details=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`: This finds the first treatment for the current doctor.

        *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1)`: Ranks the treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order *within the context of each doctor* (`per=""Doctors""`). It then filters to keep only the treatment with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result of the `WHERE` clause (which is technically a collection, even if it contains only one item) into a singular record, allowing access to its fields.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: This final `CALCULATE` selects the specific fields required for the output from the results of the previous step.
    *   `doc_last_name=doc_last_name`: Passes through the doctor's last name.

2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, reported_dt) <= 10)`**: We filter these adverse events. The `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, reported_dt)` function calculates the number of full days between the treatment start date (`start_dt` from the parent `Treatments` context) and the adverse event reported date (`reported_dt` from the `AdverseEvents` context). We keep only those events where this difference is less than or equal to 10 days.

**Explanation:**

    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This checks if the treatment has at least one associated record in the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection that meets the specified condition.
    *   `MONOTONIC(0, DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, start_dt), 14)`: Inside the `HAS` condition, we filter the `concomitant_meds`. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the *treatment's* `start_dt` (the first `start_dt`, inherited from the parent `Treatments` context) and the *concomitant medication's* `start_dt` (the second `start_dt`). `MONOTONIC(0, ..., 14)` checks if this difference is between 0 and 14 days, inclusive (i.e., started on the same day or up to 14 days after the treatment began).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(t_id=treatment_id, t_start=start_dt, t_end=end_dt)`**: After filtering, we calculate and rename the required fields from the qualifying treatments (`treatment_id`, `start_dt`, `end_dt`) so they can be easily accessed later when working with the sub-collection.
3.  **`result = qualifying_treatments.concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**: We then access the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection associated with the `qualifying_treatments`. For *each* concomitant medication belonging to these treatments, we perform a final `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`treatment_id=t_id, treatment_start_date=t_start, ... med_end_date=end_dt`**: In this final calculation, we select:
    *   The treatment details (`t_id`, `t_start`, `t_end`) inherited from the parent `qualifying_treatments` context.
    *   The start and end dates (`start_dt`, `end_dt`) of the specific concomitant medication record, renaming them to `med_start_date` and `med_end_date` for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start a calculation at the top level of the `DermTreatment` graph because we want a single aggregated result (the average age).
2.  **`average_patient_age=AVG(...)`**: We define the final output field `average_patient_age` and assign it the result of the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we specify the data to average. We start with the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: This is the filter condition. It selects only patients whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'Private'. The `&` operator represents logical AND.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_age_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, 'now'))`**: After filtering, we use another `CALCULATE` *on the filtered patients*. This calculates a new temporary field `patient_age_years` for each patient who met the criteria.
6.  **`DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, 'now')`**: This function calculates the difference between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (`'now'`) in full years, effectively giving us the patient's current age in integer years.
7.  **`.patient_age_years`**: Finally, we tell the `AVG` function to compute the average based on the `patient_age_years` field that we just calculated for the filtered set of patients.","# CALCULATE the average age of male patients with private insurance

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_stats = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute intermediate statistics for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(...)`: Calculates the number of unique coupons used.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'Completed')`: Accesses the transactions received by the merchant and filters them to include only those with a 'Completed' status.
        *   `.coupon_id`: Selects the `coupon_id` from these successful transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique, non-null `coupon_id`s found.
    *   `distinct_successful_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Calculates the number of distinct successful transactions.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'Completed')`: Again, filters for successful transactions received by the merchant.
        *   `.txid`: Selects the unique transaction identifier (`txid`).
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the total number of successful transactions (assuming `txid` is unique per transaction).

2.  **`merchant_cpur = merchant_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the intermediate results (`merchant_stats`) to compute the final CPUR and select the desired output fields.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant name from the previous step.
    *   `cpur=IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate (CPUR).
        *   `distinct_successful_transactions > 0`: Checks if the merchant had any successful transactions to avoid division by zero.
        *   `distinct_coupons_used / distinct_successful_transactions`: If there were successful transactions, calculates CPUR by dividing the count of distinct coupons used by the count of distinct successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there were no successful transactions, CPUR is defined as 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first establish the time frame.
    *   `current_week_start_ts`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., the most recent Monday or Sunday, depending on configuration).
    *   `three_weeks_ago_start_ts`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week that started exactly three weeks before the `current_week_start_ts`. This defines the start of our observation window.

2.  **`notification_info = time_boundaries.Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
    *   `WHERE(ISIN(country, (""US"", ""CA"")))`: Selects only users whose country is either 'US' or 'CA'.
    *   `.notifications`: Accesses the notifications associated with these filtered users.
    *   `.WHERE((created_at >= three_weeks_ago_start_ts) & (created_at < current_week_start_ts))`: Filters these notifications to include only those created within the last three full weeks (from `three_weeks_ago_start_ts` up to, but not including, `current_week_start_ts`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered notification, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `notification_week_start=DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the week in which the notification was created. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_notification=ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Creates a boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday.

3.  **`weekly_notification_counts = notification_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We group the `notification_info` data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(notification_week_start))`: Groups the notifications based on the `notification_week_start` date calculated previously. All notifications from the same week will be in the same group.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week_start_date=notification_week_start`: Selects the week's start date (which is the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications=COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts the total number of notification records within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_notifications=SUM(Notifications.is_weekend_notification)`: Sums the `is_weekend_notification` flag for all notifications in the group. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in sums, this effectively counts how many notifications in that week were sent on a weekend.

4.  **`result = weekly_notification_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select the final columns required by the request.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection based on three conditions combined with the logical AND operator (`&`):
    *   `sender_type == 1`: Ensures the transaction was initiated by a `User` (as opposed to a `Merchant`).
    *   `sending_user.country == 'US'`: Accesses the `sending_user` linked to the transaction and checks if their `country` attribute is 'US'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: Calculates the difference in full days between the transaction's `created_at` timestamp and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). It keeps transactions where this difference is 6 days or less, effectively selecting transactions from today and the previous 6 days (totaling 7 days inclusive).
2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs the final aggregation at the top level of the `Ewallet` graph.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the average ""Average Balance"" (AMB) for users whose balances were updated in the last 7 days (inclusive).
2.  **Definition:** AMB is defined as the average balance *per user* over the specified time duration (last 7 days).
3.  **Data Needed:** We need `UserBalances` records, specifically the `balance`, `user_id`, and `updated_at` fields.
4.  **Time Filter:** We need records where `updated_at` is within the last 7 days relative to the current time (`DATETIME('now')`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` will achieve this.
5.  **Steps:**
    *   Filter `UserBalances` for records updated within the last 7 days.
    *   Group these filtered records by `user_id`.
    *   For each user group, calculate their average balance (this is the user's AMB for the week).
    *   Calculate the overall average of these individual user AMBs.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for records updated in the last 7 days (inclusive)
recent_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)

# Step 2: Partition these recent balances by user
user_balance_groups = recent_balances.PARTITION(name=""user_weekly_balances"", by=user_id)

# Step 3: Calculate the average balance (AMB) for each user within this period
user_ambs = user_balance_groups.CALCULATE(
    # user_id=user_id, # Not needed for the final average calculation, but good for clarity if intermediate result was needed

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)`: This line starts with the `UserBalances` collection and filters it to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp is within the last 7 days (inclusive) compared to the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  `user_balance_groups = recent_balances.PARTITION(name=""user_weekly_balances"", by=user_id)`: The filtered balances are then partitioned (grouped) by `user_id`. Each partition (`user_weekly_balances`) contains all the recent balance records for a single user.
3.  `user_ambs = user_balance_groups.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates a value for each user group (partition). `AVG(UserBalances.balance)` computes the average balance for all records belonging to that specific user within the filtered timeframe (last 7 days). This result represents the AMB for each user for that week.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the latest balance for *each* user.
2.  **Collections Involved:** `Users` and `UserBalances`.
3.  **Relationship:** `Users` has a `balances` sub-collection which links to `UserBalances`.
4.  **Key Field for ""Latest"":** `UserBalances.updated_at`. We need the record with the maximum `updated_at` for each user.
5.  **Output:** For each user, return their identifier (e.g., `uid` or `username`) and their corresponding latest balance amount.

**PyDough Strategy:**

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, access their `balances` sub-collection.
3.  Within the context of each user (`per=""Users""`), rank the balance records (`UserBalances`) by `updated_at` in descending order.
4.  Filter to keep only the top-ranked record (rank 1), which represents the latest balance.
5.  Since the filter ensures only one record per user remains, use `.SINGULAR()` to treat it as a single record.
6.  Extract the `balance` field from this singular, latest record.
7.  Use `CALCULATE` on the `Users` collection to output the user identifier and their calculated latest balance.

```python
# For each user, find their latest balance record by ranking their balances
# based on the 'updated_at' timestamp in descending order within the context of each user.
# Then, select the user's identifier (uid) and the balance amount from that latest record.
lub_per_user = Users.CALCULATE(
    user_identifier=uid,
    latest_user_balance=balances.WHERE(
        # Rank balances by date descending, partitioned by user
        RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1
    ).SINGULAR().balance # Get the balance from the single latest record
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Users` collection and specify the fields we want in the final output.
2.  `user_identifier=uid`: We select the unique identifier (`uid`) for each user and name it `user_identifier`. You could use `username` if preferred.
3.  `latest_user_balance=...`: This defines the second output field, calculating the latest balance.
4.  `balances.WHERE(...)`: We access the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user.
5.  `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks the balance records based on their `updated_at` timestamp, with the most recent date getting rank 1.
    *   `per=""Users""`: Crucially, this ensures the ranking is performed independently *for each user*. It partitions the ranking operation by the parent `Users` collection record.
    *   `== 1`: Filters the balances to keep only the record with rank 1 (the latest one) for each user.
6.  `.SINGULAR()`: Since the `WHERE` clause guarantees that only one balance record (the latest) remains for each user, `.SINGULAR()` is used to treat this single resulting record as a singular value, which is required for accessing its fields within `CALCULATE`.
7.  `.balance`: Finally, we access the `balance` field from the singular, latest balance record identified in the previous steps.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_settings = Users.setting_snapshots.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `setting_snapshots` for all `Users`.
2.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: This ranks the snapshots within each user's list based on their `snapshot_date`, with the most recent date getting rank 1.

    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the snapshot with rank 1 (the latest one) for each user.

7.  **`result = user_marketing_preferences`**: The final result containing the user ID and their latest marketing opt-in preference is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Find the latest setting snapshot for each user

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. We apply a `WHERE` clause with `HAS` to filter only those merchants who have received at least one transaction with the status 'Completed'. This avoids potential errors or null sums for merchants with no relevant transactions.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, merchant_category=category, total_revenue=SUM(...))`**: For the filtered merchants, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name`: Renaming `name` for clarity.
    *   `merchant_category`: Renaming `category`.
    *   `total_revenue`: We use the `SUM` aggregation function on the `transactions_received` sub-collection. Inside the `SUM`, we filter these transactions again to include only those where `status == 'Completed'` and sum their `amount`.
3.  **`ranked_merchant_revenue = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: We take the `merchant_revenues` collection (which now has name, category, and total revenue for each relevant merchant) and apply another `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: Inside this `CALCULATE`, we compute the `revenue_rank` using the `RANKING` window function. We rank `by` the `total_revenue` calculated in the previous step, using `.DESC()` so that the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.
5.  **`result = ranked_merchant_revenue.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select the final required fields: `merchant_name`, `merchant_category`, `revenue_amount` (renaming `total_revenue`), and `revenue_rank`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Calculation:** We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using `Ewallet.CALCULATE` and the `DATETIME` function. `start_prev_prev_month` marks the beginning of our analysis period (start of the month two months ago), and `start_current_month` marks the end (exclusive).
2.  **Transaction Filtering:** We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that fall within the calculated date range (`created_at >= start_prev_prev_month` and `created_at < start_current_month`) and where the `sender_type` is 1 (indicating a User, based on the schema description).
3.  **Daily Information Extraction:** We extract the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` from the `created_at` timestamp and retain the `sender_id` (renamed to `user_sender_id` for clarity) for each relevant transaction.
4.  **Daily Partitioning:** We use `PARTITION` named `days` to group these transactions by `tx_year`, `tx_month`, and `tx_day`.
5.  **DAU Calculation:** Within each daily partition (`days`), we calculate the `dau_count` by counting the number of distinct `user_sender_id`s using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.user_sender_id)`. This gives us the Daily Active Users for each specific day in the period.
6.  **Monthly Partitioning:** We then partition the results from the previous step (which now contains daily DAU counts) by `tx_year` and `tx_month`, naming this partition `months`.
7.  **PMDAU Calculation:** Finally, for each monthly partition (`months`), we calculate the `pmdau` by taking the `AVG` of the `dau_count` values from the `daily_active_users` collection (which represents the daily counts within that month). We also format the month as 'YYYY-MM' for readability.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and filter it to include only users who have at least one session starting within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). The `HAS(...) == 1` condition checks for the existence of such sessions.
2.  **`CALCULATE(uid = uid, total_duration = SUM(...))`**: For the filtered users, we calculate two fields:
    *   `uid = uid`: Selects the user's unique identifier.
    *   `total_duration = SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of session durations for each user.
3.  **`sessions.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `SUM`, we again access the `sessions` sub-collection for the current user and filter them based on the same date range (`session_start_ts >= ""2023-06-01""` and `session_start_ts < ""2023-06-08""`).

**Analysis of the Request:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the total transaction amount for *each* coupon associated with a specific merchant (ID 1).
2.  **Input:** Merchant ID = 1.
3.  **Output:** Coupon ID and the total transaction amount for that coupon.
4.  **Collections Involved:** `Merchants`, `Coupons`, `Transactions`.
5.  **Relationships:**
    *   `Merchants` have `coupons`.
    *   `Coupons` have `transaction_used_in` (linking to `Transactions`).
    *   `Transactions` have an `amount`.
6.  **Operation:** Filter merchants, access their coupons, and for each coupon, sum the amounts of the transactions it was used in.

**PyDough Code Generation:**

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter for the merchant with `mid == 1`.
3.  Access the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
4.  Use `CALCULATE` on the `coupons` collection to get the `cid` and the sum of transaction amounts.

```python
# Filter for the merchant with ID 1 and access their coupons
merchant_1_coupons = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons

# Calculate the total transaction amount for each coupon issued by merchant 1
result = merchant_1_coupons.CALCULATE(
    coupon_id=cid,
    total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`: This selects the specific merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is 1.
2.  `.coupons`: From the selected merchant, this accesses the `coupons` sub-collection, which contains all coupons issued by that merchant.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is applied to each coupon within the `merchant_1_coupons` collection.
    *   `coupon_id=cid`: Selects the coupon's unique identifier (`cid`) and includes it in the result, renaming it to `coupon_id`.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: For each coupon, it accesses the list of transactions where the coupon was used (`transaction_used_in`) and calculates the sum of the `amount` for all those transactions. This sum is assigned to the `total_amount` field in the result.

This query efficiently filters down to the relevant merchant, accesses their coupons, and then aggregates the transaction amounts for each coupon individually.","# Filter for the merchant with ID 1 and access their coupons

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the ""Total number of user sessions (TUC)"" within the last month, including today and exactly one month ago.
2.  **Definition:** TUC is explicitly defined as the total count of records in the `UserSessions` collection within the specified timeframe.
3.  **Collection:** We need to access the `UserSessions` collection.
4.  **Field:** The relevant field for filtering is `session_start_ts`.
5.  **Timeframe:** ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"". This means we need sessions where `session_start_ts` is between `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` and `DATETIME('now')`.
6.  **Operation:** We need to filter the `UserSessions` based on the timeframe and then count the resulting records.
7.  **Output:** Return the total count.

**PyDough Code Generation:**

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `UserSessions` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these sessions.
2.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month'))`: This condition checks if the session start timestamp (`session_start_ts`) is on or after the date exactly one month prior to the current moment (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
3.  `(session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition checks if the session start timestamp is on or before the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`).
4.  `&`: The ampersand combines the two conditions, ensuring sessions meet *both* criteria (i.e., started within the last month, inclusive).
5.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This line uses the top-level `Ewallet` graph to perform a final calculation.
6.  `tuc_past_month = COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)`: Inside the `CALCULATE`, we define a field named `tuc_past_month`. Its value is determined by applying the `COUNT` aggregation function to the `sessions_in_past_month` collection (which contains the sessions filtered in the previous step). This effectively counts the total number of user sessions that started in the past month.","# Define the timeframe: sessions started between 1 MONTH ago and now (inclusive)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection to define the date boundaries for the previous month.
    *   `start_of_current_month=DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: Calculates the timestamp for the very beginning of the current month.
    *   `start_of_prev_month=DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`: Calculates the timestamp for the very beginning of the month *before* the current one.

2.  **`transaction_counts = date_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: Using the calculated dates, we count the relevant transactions.
    *   `total_prev_month_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts all records in the `Transactions` collection where the `created_at` timestamp is greater than or equal to the start of the previous month (`start_of_prev_month`) AND less than the start of the current month (`start_of_current_month`). This gives the total number of transactions in the previous calendar month.
    *   `successful_prev_month_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts transactions within the same date range but adds an additional condition: `status == 'Completed'`. This gives the total number of successful transactions in the previous month.

3.  **`result = transaction_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step calculates the STR based on the counts obtained previously.
    *   `previous_month_str=IFF(...)`: Uses the `IFF` function for conditional logic.
        *   `total_prev_month_transactions > 0`: Checks if there were any transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero.
        *   `100.0 * successful_prev_month_transactions / total_prev_month_transactions`: If there were transactions, it calculates the STR percentage (multiplying by `100.0` ensures floating-point division).
        *   `0.0`: If there were no transactions (`total_prev_month_transactions` was 0), the STR is defined as 0.0.

2.  **`merchant_coupon_counts = merchant_creation_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the results from the previous step. For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_same_month`. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection associated with the merchant.
    *   Filtering these `coupons` using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `created_at` year and month match the `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` calculated in the previous step.
    *   Counting the remaining coupons using `COUNT()`.
3.  **`top_merchant = merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: This step finds the single merchant with the highest `num_coupons_same_month`.
    *   `TOP_K(1, ...)` selects the top 1 record.
    *   `by=num_coupons_same_month.DESC()` specifies that the ranking should be based on the calculated coupon count in descending order (highest count first).

    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `transaction_year`, `transaction_month`, and the `user_identifier` (which is the `sender_id`) for each qualifying transaction.

2.  **`monthly_user_counts`**:
    *   Takes the `filtered_user_transactions` collection.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group these transactions based on the combination of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`. Each group represents a specific month in 2023.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Keeps the `year_val` and `month_val` (from the partition keys).
        *   Calculates `distinct_sending_users` by applying `NDISTINCT` to the `user_identifier` field within each month's partition group. This counts the unique active users who sent money in that specific month.

3.  **`result`**:
    *   Takes the `monthly_user_counts`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to format the output:
        *   Creates a `month_date` string representing the first day of the month (e.g., ""2023-01-01"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` to ensure the month has two digits.

Consider all transaction types in the results you return, but only include the merchant ids in your final answer.",SELECT DISTINCT m.mid AS merchant_id FROM merchants AS m JOIN wallet_transactions_daily AS t ON m.mid = t.receiver_id WHERE t.receiver_type = 1;,Ewallet,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Get a unique list of merchant IDs (`mid`) that have been the *receiver* in a transaction.
2.  **Starting Collection:** `Transactions` is the most relevant collection as it contains sender/receiver information.
3.  **Filtering:** We need transactions where the `receiver_type` indicates a merchant. Based on the schema description (`sender_type`: 1 for User, 2 for Merchant; `receiver_type`: 1 for User, 2 for Merchant), we'll filter for `receiver_type == 2`.
4.  **Identifying the Merchant ID:** For transactions where the receiver is a merchant, the `receiver_id` field holds the merchant's ID (`mid`).
5.  **Ensuring Distinctness:** We need only unique merchant IDs. The `PARTITION` function is suitable for grouping by `receiver_id`, which effectively gives us distinct IDs.
6.  **Output:** The final result should only contain the distinct merchant IDs.

**PyDough Code Generation:**

```python
# Find all distinct merchant IDs that have received money in any transaction.
distinct_receiving_merchant_ids = Transactions.WHERE(
    receiver_type == 2  # Filter transactions where the receiver is a merchant
).PARTITION(
    name=""receiving_merchants"", by=receiver_id  # Group by receiver_id to get distinct merchant IDs
).CALCULATE(
    merchant_id=receiver_id  # Select the distinct merchant ID (which is the partition key)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(receiver_type == 2)`: This selects only those transactions where the entity receiving the funds is identified as a merchant (assuming `receiver_type == 2` signifies a merchant as per the schema description pattern).
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""receiving_merchants"", by=receiver_id)`: This groups the filtered transactions based on the unique `receiver_id`. Since `receiver_id` corresponds to the merchant's ID (`mid`) in this context, partitioning by it ensures that we process each unique receiving merchant ID only once.
3.  `.CALCULATE(merchant_id=receiver_id)`: For each distinct group (representing a unique receiving merchant), this step selects the `receiver_id` (which is the unique merchant ID we partitioned by) and renames it to `merchant_id` for clarity in the final output, fulfilling the requirement to return only the distinct merchant IDs.","# Find all distinct merchant IDs that have received money in any transaction.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'Transaction')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'Transaction')`: This inner part accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and filters these notifications to keep only those where the `notification_type` field is exactly 'Transaction'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: The `HAS` function checks if the filtered sub-collection (transaction notifications) contains at least one record for the current user. The filter keeps only those users for whom this condition is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_id=uid)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the `uid` field from the resulting users and rename it to `user_id` for clarity in the output. Since we are filtering the `Users` collection directly, the resulting `user_id` values will be distinct.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users`**: We start with the `Users` collection, which contains all user records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(notifications) == 1)`**: This filters the `Users` collection.
    *   `notifications` refers to the sub-collection of notifications linked to each user.
    *   `HASNOT(notifications)` checks if this sub-collection is empty for a given user. It returns `True` (or 1) if the user has no notifications and `False` (or 0) otherwise.
    *   The condition `== 1` ensures we only keep users for whom `HASNOT(notifications)` is true, meaning they have received zero notifications.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_id=uid, user_name=username)`**: This selects and potentially renames the fields for the final output.
    *   `user_id=uid`: Selects the `uid` field and names it `user_id` in the result.
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username` field and names it `user_name` in the result.

**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`: This groups all records in the `UserSessions` collection based on their `device_type`. Each group represents a unique device type found in the sessions.
2.  `.CALCULATE(device_type=device_type, session_count=COUNT(UserSessions))`: For each `device_type` group created by the partition, this calculates two fields:
    *   `device_type`: The actual device type for the group (e.g., 'iOS', 'Android').
    *   `session_count`: The total number of `UserSessions` records belonging to that specific `device_type` group. `COUNT(UserSessions)` counts the records within the context of each partition group.
3.  `.TOP_K(2, by=session_count.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (one row per unique device type with its count), sorts them in descending order based on `session_count`, and selects only the top 2 rows. This yields the two device types with the highest session counts.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Coupons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Coupons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each coupon.
    *   `coupon_code = code`: Selects the coupon code and assigns it to the `coupon_code` field in the result.
    *   `total_redemptions = COUNT(transaction_used_in)`: Counts the number of transactions linked to each coupon via the `transaction_used_in` relationship. This gives us the frequency of use (redemption count).
    *   `total_amount_redeemed = SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field from all transactions linked to each coupon. This gives the total value redeemed using that coupon.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sending_users = Users.WHERE(HAS(transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)) == 1)`**: This line starts with the `Users` collection and filters it. It keeps only those users who have at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) transaction in their `transactions_sent` list where the `sender_type` is explicitly `0`. This ensures we only consider users who have sent transactions as users.
2.  **`country_groups = sending_users.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=country)`**: The filtered `sending_users` are then partitioned (grouped) based on their `country` field. Each partition (`country_group`) contains users from the same country who have sent transactions.
3.  **`top_countries_by_sent_amount = country_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs calculations on each country partition:
    *   `country_name=country`: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
    *   `distinct_users_count=COUNT(Users)`: Counts the number of unique users within the current country partition. Since the partition is already based on users who sent transactions, this gives the count of distinct senders for that country.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`active_retail_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Merchants` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `status == 'Active'`: Selects merchants whose status is 'Active'.

    The result is a collection of merchants meeting both criteria.

    *   **`MEDIAN(...)`**: This aggregation function calculates the median value of the expression provided.
    *   **`active_retail_merchants.balances`**: Accesses the `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `MerchantBalances`) for the previously filtered `active_retail_merchants`.
    *   **`.WHERE(DATETIME(updated_at, 'start of day') == DATETIME('now', 'start of day'))`**: Filters these balance records to include only those where the `updated_at` date matches today's date. We use `DATETIME(..., 'start of day')` on both sides to ensure we compare only the date part, ignoring the time.
    *   **`.balance`**: Accesses the `balance` field from the filtered daily balance records.
    *   **`median_today_balance=...`**: Assigns the calculated median value to the field `median_today_balance` in the final result.

3.  **`result = median_merchant_balance`**: Assigns the calculated median balance to the final `result` variable.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`snapshots_in_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only the records where the `snapshot_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  **`earliest_snapshots_2023 = snapshots_in_2023.WHERE(...)`**: This line further filters the 2023 snapshots.
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)`: This function ranks the snapshots within the `snapshots_in_2023` collection based on their `snapshot_date` in ascending order (earliest first). `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest date, they all receive rank 1.
    *   `== 1`: This condition selects only the snapshots that have rank 1, meaning they occurred on the earliest date(s) in 2023.
3.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs a final calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level.
    *   `avg_daily_limit=AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_daily)`: Calculates the average of the `tx_limit_daily` field across all the snapshots identified in the `earliest_snapshots_2023` collection.
    *   `avg_monthly_limit=AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_monthly)`: Calculates the average of the `tx_limit_monthly` field across the same set of earliest snapshots.
4.  The final `result` variable holds a single record containing the average daily and monthly transaction limits from the earliest snapshot date(s) in 2023.","# Filter snapshots to include only those from the year 2023

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"```python

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = avg_duration_by_device
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `UserSessions` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection where each row represents a user session and includes:
    *   `device_type`: The type of device used for the session.
    *   `session_duration_seconds`: The duration of the session calculated in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between the `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`.

2.  **`session_durations.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`**: This takes the `session_durations` collection and partitions (groups) it based on the unique values in the `device_type` field. Each partition group contains all sessions associated with a specific device type.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each partition group created in the previous step.
    *   `device_type = device_type`: Selects the `device_type` (which is the partition key) for the output.
    *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(UserSessions.session_duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `session_duration_seconds` (calculated in the first step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` partition group. We refer back to `UserSessions.session_duration_seconds` to access the duration calculated before partitioning.

4.  **`result = avg_duration_by_device`**: The final result, containing each `device_type` and its corresponding average session duration in seconds, is assigned to the variable `result`.","# CALCULATE the duration in seconds for each user session
session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.coupons`: We start by accessing all coupons associated with merchants.
2.  `.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This filters the coupons. For each merchant (`per=""Merchants""`), it ranks their coupons based on the `start_date` in ascending order (`start_date.ASC()`). It keeps only the coupon ranked first (rank `== 1`), which is the one with the earliest start date for that specific merchant.
3.  `.WHERE((start_date >= merchant.created_at) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant.created_at, start_date) <= 365))`: We further filter these earliest coupons. We check two conditions:
    *   `start_date >= merchant.created_at`: Ensures the coupon didn't start before the merchant registered. We access the parent merchant's registration date using `merchant.created_at`.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant.created_at, start_date) <= 365`: Calculates the difference in days between the merchant's registration date and the coupon's start date, ensuring it's within 365 days (one year).
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Finally, for the coupons that meet all criteria, we select the required information:
    *   `merchant_id = merchant.mid`: The ID of the parent merchant.
    *   `merchant_registration_date = merchant.created_at`: The registration date of the parent merchant.
    *   `earliest_coupon_id = cid`: The ID of the earliest coupon that met the criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Users` collection and applying a filter using `WHERE`.
2.  **`HASNOT(...) == 1`**: This function checks if a sub-collection (or a filtered version of it) is empty. We are looking for users where the *result* of the inner `notifications.WHERE(...)` is empty, meaning they have *no* notifications matching that inner condition.
3.  **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: Inside `HASNOT`, we access the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and filter these notifications.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) < 365`**: This is the core condition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date1, date2)` calculates the number of full days between `date1` and `date2`.
    *   `Users.created_at` refers to the signup date of the parent `User` record.
    *   `created_at` refers to the creation date of the current `notification` record being evaluated.
    *   The condition `< 365` filters for notifications that were created less than 365 days *after* the user signed up (i.e., within the first year).
5.  **`CALCULATE(user_name=username, user_email=email, signup_date=created_at)`**: After filtering the users, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the required fields: `username`, `email`, and the user's `created_at` date, renaming them for clarity in the output.
6.  **`result = ...`**: The final query is assigned to the `result` variable.
