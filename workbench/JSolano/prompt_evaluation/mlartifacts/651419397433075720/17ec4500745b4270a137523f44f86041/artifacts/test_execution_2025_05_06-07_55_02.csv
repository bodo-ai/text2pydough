"For customers with at least 5 total transactions, what is their transaction success rate? Return the customer name and success rate, ordered from lowest to highest success rate.","WITH cust_tx_stats AS (SELECT c.sbCustId, c.sbCustName, COUNT(t.sbTxId) AS total_tx, SUM(CASE WHEN t.sbTxStatus = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS success_tx FROM sbCustomer AS c JOIN sbTransaction AS t ON c.sbCustId = t.sbTxCustId GROUP BY c.sbCustId, c.sbCustName) SELECT sbCustName, CAST(success_tx AS FLOAT) / total_tx * 100 AS success_rate FROM cust_tx_stats WHERE total_tx >= 5 ORDER BY CASE WHEN success_rate IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, success_rate;",Broker,"To calculate the transaction success rate for customers with at least 5 total transactions, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate:
    *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer.
    *   `num_total_transactions`: The total count of transactions made by the customer.
    *   `num_successful_transactions`: The count of transactions made by the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
3.  Filter these results to include only customers where `num_total_transactions` is 5 or more.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate the `success_rate` as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. We multiply by 100.0 to express the rate as a percentage and ensure floating-point division.
5.  Select only the `customer_name` and the calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Order the final result by `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
customer_success_rates = Customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    num_successful_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))
).WHERE(
    num_total_transactions >= 5
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=customer_name,
    success_rate=(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing each customer.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `num_total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts all transactions for the customer using the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `num_successful_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts only the transactions that have a `status` of ""Completed"".
2.  `.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`: This filters the results from the previous step, keeping only customers who have made at least 5 transactions.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the filtered customers, we calculate the final desired fields.
    *   `customer_name=customer_name`: Keeps the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate=(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`: Calculates the success rate as a percentage. The `num_total_transactions` will be at least 5, so division by zero is avoided.
4.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`: Sorts the resulting list of customers by their success rate, from the lowest to the highest.",23.771297931671143,"customer_success_rates = Customers.CALCULATE(

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Filter the `Customers` collection:
    *   Select customers whose `email` address ends with "".com"".
    *   From this group, select customers who have made at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
3.  Count the number of such distinct customers.

The query will first filter customers based on their email and their transaction history related to FAANG stocks. Then, it will count these filtered customers.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols for clarity
faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

)

# Count the number of distinct customers found
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    num_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple of FAANG stock ticker symbols for easier reference in the query.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Customers` collection.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed via the `ticker` relationship from `Transactions` to `Tickers`) is present in the `faang_symbols` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Evaluates to true if the customer has one or more such FAANG stock transactions.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers satisfying both ('.com' email AND FAANG stock purchase) are included in `filtered_customers`.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the date range for ""the last 8 weeks excluding the current week"".
    *   `start_of_current_week_expr`: Calculates the start date of the current week.
    *   `start_date_limit_expr`: Calculates the start date of the 8-week period, which is 8 weeks before the start of the current week.
    *   `end_date_limit_expr`: Calculates the end date of the 8-week period, which is the day just before the current week begins (i.e., the end of the previous week).

2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that:
    *   Are for stocks (`ticker.ticker_type == ""STOCK""`).
    *   Fall within the defined 8-week date range (`date_time >= start_date_limit_expr` and `date_time <= end_date_limit_expr`).

3.  **Prepare Data for Grouping**: On these filtered transactions, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_calc`: The starting date of the week for each transaction. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_calc`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`.

4.  **Group by Week**: We use `PARTITION` to group these processed transactions by their `week_start_calc`.

5.  **Aggregate Results**: For each weekly group, we `CALCULATE`:
    *   `week_identifier`: The start date of the week.
    *   `num_total_stock_transactions`: The total count of stock transactions in that week using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `num_weekend_stock_transactions`: The count of stock transactions that occurred on a weekend. This is achieved by `SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_calc)`, as the boolean `is_weekend_calc` (True/False) will be treated as 1/0 in the sum.

6.  **Order Results**: The results are ordered by the week start date for clarity.
