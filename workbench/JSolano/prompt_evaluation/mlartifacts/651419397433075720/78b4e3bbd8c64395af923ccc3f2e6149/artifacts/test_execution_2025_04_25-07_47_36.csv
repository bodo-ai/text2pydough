**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to keep only those customers who have 5 or more transactions associated with them (accessed via the `transactions_made` relationship).
2.  **`customer_transaction_counts = filtered_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this calculates two new fields:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `total_transactions`: Counts all transactions for each customer.
    *   `successful_transactions`: Counts only the transactions where the `status` field is exactly 'Completed'.
3.  **`customer_success_rates = customer_transaction_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the intermediate result and calculates the `success_rate` by dividing the count of successful transactions by the total count and multiplying by 100.0 (to ensure floating-point division and represent it as a percentage). It selects the `customer_name` and the calculated `success_rate`.
4.  **`result = customer_success_rates.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Finally, this line sorts the resulting collection in ascending order based on the calculated `success_rate`.",16.451460599899292,"# Filter customers to include only those with at least 5 transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: Defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression used for clarity and reusability.
2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: Starts with the `Customers` collection and applies filters using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`ENDSWITH(email, '.com')`**: Filters customers whose `email` field ends with '.com'.
4.  **`&`**: Combines the email filter with the transaction filter using a logical AND.
5.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`**: This is the core logic for checking stock purchases:
    *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions associated with each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the associated `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` tuple (using `ISIN`).
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the customer has at least one transaction that meets the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., involves a FAANG stock).
6.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: Aggregates the result at the top `Broker` level.
7.  **`distinct_customer_count = COUNT(filtered_customers)`**: Counts the number of distinct customers remaining after applying the filters and assigns the count to the `distinct_customer_count` field.",13.296039342880247,"# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `join_date >= ""2023-01-01""`: Selects customers whose join date is on or after January 1, 2023.
    *   `status == ""Active""`: Selects customers whose status is 'Active'.
2.  **`filtered_customers.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the `filtered_customers` and partitions (groups) them based on the `country` field. Each partition represents a unique country found among the filtered customers. The partition is named `country_group`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each partition (country group) created in the previous step.
    *   `country=country`: Selects the `country` field (which is the partition key).
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of `Customers` records within the current partition (i.e., the number of active customers who joined since 2023-01-01 for that specific country). The result is assigned to the `tac_count` field.
