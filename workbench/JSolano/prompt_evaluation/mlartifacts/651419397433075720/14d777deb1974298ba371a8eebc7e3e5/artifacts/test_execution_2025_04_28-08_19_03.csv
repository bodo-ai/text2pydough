**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it to include only those merchants who have at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) received transaction (`transactions_received`) that is marked as 'completed' (`WHERE(status == 'completed')`). This pre-filtering prevents potential division-by-zero errors later if a merchant has no successful transactions.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered merchants, we calculate the required output fields.
3.  **`merchant_name=name`**: We select the merchant's name.
4.  **`cpur = NDISTINCT(...) / NDISTINCT(...)`**: We calculate the CPUR according to the definition:
    *   **`NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').coupon_id)`**: This counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s associated with the merchant's successful received transactions.
    *   **`NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').txid)`**: This counts the number of unique successful received transactions (using `txid` as the unique identifier for a transaction).
    *   The division gives the Coupon Usage Rate (CPUR).",20.60519528388977,"merchant_cpur = Merchants.WHERE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Period:** We first define the `start_period` (start of the week 3 weeks ago) and `end_period` (start of the current week) using the `DATETIME` function with relative offsets ('-3 weeks') and truncation ('start of week').
2.  **Filter Notifications:** We start with the `Notifications` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `created_at >= start_period`: Ensures notifications are from the beginning of the 3-week period or later.
    *   `created_at < end_period`: Ensures notifications are before the start of the current week.
    *   `ISIN(user.country, (""US"", ""Canada""))`: Filters for notifications sent to users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Calculate Week Start:** In the same step, we use `CALCULATE` to create a new field `notification_week_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`. This field will be used for grouping.
4.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` on the filtered `notification_info` collection.
    *   `name=""weekly_notifications""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(notification_week_start)`: Groups the notifications based on the calculated `notification_week_start` date.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts:** After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` on the resulting groups:
    *   `week_start_date = notification_week_start`: Selects the grouping key (the start date of the week).
    *   `total_notifications = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications belonging to the current week's partition group.
    *   `weekend_notifications = COUNT(KEEP_IF(Notifications, ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts only the notifications within the group whose `created_at` falls on a Saturday or Sunday. `DAYNAME` extracts the day name, `ISIN` checks if it's Saturday or Sunday, and `KEEP_IF` returns the notification record only if the condition is true, which `COUNT` then counts.
6.  **Order Results:** Finally, `ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())` sorts the output chronologically by the week start date.",35.335514307022095,"# Define the time boundaries for the last 3 weeks, excluding the current week

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on multiple conditions combined with the logical AND operator (`&`).
    *   **`sending_user.country == ""US""`**: It filters transactions where the `country` of the `sending_user` (accessed via the relationship) is ""US"".
    *   **`transaction_type == ""wallet""`**: It further filters for transactions where the `transaction_type` field is exactly ""wallet"".
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 6`**: This condition filters transactions based on their creation date (`created_at`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's creation date and the current moment ('now'). By checking if this difference is less than or equal to 6, we include transactions from today (0 days difference) and the previous 6 days, effectively covering the ""last 7 days inclusive"".
2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations at the top `Ewallet` graph level using the previously filtered transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, 'now') <= 7)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days (inclusive) from the current time ('now'). `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, 'now')` calculates the difference in days between the update time and now.
2.  **`user_amb_calculation = recent_user_balances.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered `recent_user_balances` based on the `user_id`. This groups all recent balance records for each unique user together.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_average_balance=AVG(UserBalances.balance))`**: Within each user partition created in the previous step, this calculates the average `balance` for that specific user's records from the filtered set. This gives the Average Balance (AMB) for each user during the specified period. The result `user_amb_calculation` is a collection where each row represents a user and their calculated average balance (`user_average_balance`).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and name it `user_id`.
3.  **`latest_user_balance=...`**: This calculates the LUB for each user.
4.  **`balances.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user.
5.  **`RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function:
    *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks the balance records based on the `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (latest first).
    *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures the ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
    *   `== 1`: Filters to keep only the balance record with rank 1 (the most recent one).
6.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause with `RANKING(...) == 1` guarantees that at most one balance record remains for each user, `.SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record, allowing access to its fields.
7.  **`.balance`**: We access the `balance` field from the singular, most recent balance record identified.
8.  **`DEFAULT_TO(..., None)`**: This function wraps the balance retrieval. If a user has no balance records (`balances` is empty), the `WHERE` clause will yield nothing, `.SINGULAR()` will result in null, and accessing `.balance` would normally fail. `DEFAULT_TO` catches this and returns `None` instead, ensuring the query doesn't error for users without balances.",25.466556787490845,"# Calculate the Latest User Balance (LUB) for each user.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_snapshot = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing all `UserSettingSnapshots`.
2.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: This orders the snapshots for each user by their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first).
    *   `per=""Users""`: This ensures the ranking is done independently for each user (partitioned by user).
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the snapshot ranked as #1 (the latest one) for each user.
3.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the ranking filter ensures we have at most one snapshot per user, we use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this result as a single record within the context of each user. This allows direct access to its fields in the subsequent `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`user_marketing_preferences = Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We then go back to the `Users` collection.
5.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's ID (`uid`).
6.  **`marketing_preference=latest_snapshot.marketing_opt_in`**: We access the `marketing_opt_in` field from the `latest_snapshot` variable we defined earlier. Because `latest_snapshot` was made singular relative to each user, we can directly access its `marketing_opt_in` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, we calculate:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Calculation:** We first define `start_date` and `end_date` using the `DATETIME` function to precisely capture the last two full calendar months, excluding the current month. `start_date` is set to the beginning of the month two months ago, and `end_date` is set to the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Transaction Filtering:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply filters:
    *   `sender_type == 0`: Selects only transactions initiated by users.
    *   `created_at >= start_date & created_at < end_date`: Filters transactions to fall within the desired two-month period.
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the specific day (`transaction_day`), month (`transaction_month`), and the `sender_id` for each relevant transaction.
3.  **Daily Active Users (DAU) Calculation:**
    *   We partition the `filtered_transactions` by both `transaction_month` and `transaction_day` using `PARTITION(name=""daily_groups"", ...)`. This groups transactions by each specific day within the two-month period.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` following the partition, we calculate `dau_count = NDISTINCT(Transactions.user_id)`. This counts the number of unique users (`sender_id`) who made at least one transaction on that specific `day` within that `month`.
4.  **Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) Calculation:**
    *   We take the `daily_active_users` results (which contain daily unique user counts) and partition them again, this time only by `month` using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", ...)`.
    *   In the final `CALCULATE`, we compute `pmdau = AVG(daily_groups.dau_count)`. This calculates the average of the daily active user counts (`dau_count`) for each `month`, giving us the PMDAU. The `daily_groups` refers back to the collection created by the previous partition step.
5.  **Ordering:** Finally, `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically by month.",29.008856058120728,"# Define the start and end dates for the last two full months

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the `Ewallet` top-level collection.

    *   `start_of_previous_month`: Calculates the beginning of the previous month by subtracting one month from the `start_of_current_month`.
2.  **`transactions_previous_month`**: We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those records where the `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to `start_of_previous_month` and less than `start_of_current_month`).
3.  **`transaction_stats`**: We calculate two aggregate values based on the filtered transactions:
    *   `total_transactions_prev_month`: The total count of transactions in the previous month.
    *   `successful_transactions_prev_month`: The count of transactions within the previous month where the `status` is 'completed'.
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR).
    *   We use the `IFF` function to check if `total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
    *   If there were transactions, we calculate STR by dividing `successful_transactions_prev_month` by `total_transactions_prev_month`. We multiply by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division.
    *   If there were no transactions (`total_transactions_prev_month` is 0), STR is set to `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to process each merchant individually and compute new fields:
    *   `merchant_mid`: Stores the merchant's ID (`mid`).
    *   `merchant_name`: Stores the merchant's name (`name`).
    *   `num_same_month_coupons`: This calculates the count of coupons for the current merchant. It accesses the `coupons` sub-collection and applies a `WHERE` filter. The filter keeps only those coupons where the coupon's creation year (`YEAR(coupons.created_at)`) and month (`MONTH(coupons.created_at)`) are the same as the merchant's creation year (`YEAR(created_at)`) and month (`MONTH(created_at)`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: Starts by accessing the `Users` collection and filtering it based on specific criteria.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: Filters users whose `country` field, when converted to lowercase, is exactly 'us'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the country.
3.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is a crucial filter.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and filters these notifications.
    *   `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`: The inner filter keeps only notifications that are of type 'promotional' AND have a status of 'unread'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the user has *at least one* notification that matches the inner filter criteria (unread and promotional). Only users who meet this condition, along with the country condition, are kept.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who passed the `WHERE` clause filters:
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username` field and assigns it to the new field `user_name`.
    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(...)`: Calculates the total count of unread promotional notifications for each selected user.
        *   `COUNT(notifications.WHERE(...))`: Counts the number of notifications within the user's `notifications` sub-collection that satisfy the condition `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step filters the `Transactions` collection based on multiple criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Selects transactions only from the year 2023.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successfully completed transactions.
    *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Ensures the sender was a user, excluding merchants.
    *   `sending_user.status == ""active""`: Filters for transactions where the associated sending user has an 'active' status.
2.  **`transaction_info`**: This step calculates two new fields for the filtered transactions:
    *   `transaction_month_date`: Extracts the date corresponding to the start of the month from the transaction's `created_at` timestamp using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `sending_user_id`: Retrieves the unique identifier (`uid`) of the sending user, which is needed for counting distinct users later.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: This step partitions the `transaction_info` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_transactions"", by=(transaction_month_date))`: Groups the transactions based on the `transaction_month_date` calculated previously. All transactions from the same month will be in the same group.
4.  **`monthly_active_user_counts`**: This step calculates the final result for each monthly group:
    *   `month_start_date=transaction_month_date`: Selects the month date (which is the partition key).
    *   `distinct_active_users_count=NDISTINCT(monthly_transactions.sending_user_id)`: Counts the number of unique `sending_user_id` values within each month's partition group (`monthly_transactions`). This gives the count of distinct active users who sent money in that specific month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_info = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `sender_type` is 0 (indicating the sender is a user). It then uses `CALCULATE` to create a temporary collection containing the sending user's country (`sender_country`), the sending user's unique ID (`sender_uid`), and the transaction amount (`tx_amount`) for each of these filtered transactions.
2.  **`country_groups = transactions_info.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(sender_country))`**: This partitions the `transactions_info` collection into groups based on the `sender_country`. Each partition (`country_group`) contains all the transaction information (country, user ID, amount) for a specific country.
3.  **`country_stats = country_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line operates on the partitioned data. For each `country_group`, it calculates:
    *   `country`: The country name (which is the partition key `sender_country`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_merchant_transactions`**: This intermediate step defines the set of transactions we are interested in for each merchant. It accesses the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant and applies two filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150`: This filters transactions created within the last 150 days (inclusive) relative to the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: This filters transactions where the `receiver_type` field is exactly 1, as specified in the request.
2.  **`merchant_totals`**: This step calculates the required aggregates for each merchant that has relevant transactions.
    *   It starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(recent_merchant_transactions) == 1)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection to include only those merchants who have at least one transaction matching the criteria defined in `recent_merchant_transactions`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the required output fields for each qualifying merchant:
        *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(recent_merchant_transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions identified in the `recent_merchant_transactions` step for the current merchant.
        *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(recent_merchant_transactions.amount)`: Sums the `amount` of the transactions identified in the `recent_merchant_transactions` step for the current merchant.
3.  **`top_2_merchants`**: This step selects the top 2 merchants from the `merchant_totals` collection.
    *   `TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the top 2 records, ordering them in descending order (`DESC()`) based on the `total_transaction_amount` calculated previously.
4.  **`result = top_2_merchants`**: The final result containing the top 2 merchants, their transaction counts, and total amounts is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.235265970230103,"# Filter transactions received by merchants within the last 150 days where receiver_type is 1

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`earliest_info = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `Ewallet` level to calculate a global value: the earliest snapshot date in 2023.
    *   **`MIN(UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023).snapshot_date)`**: This finds the minimum `snapshot_date` among all snapshots within the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection where the year of the `snapshot_date` is 2023.
    *   **`min_date_2023=...`**: The calculated minimum date is stored in the variable `min_date_2023`.
2.  **`result = earliest_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform another calculation at the `Ewallet` level, using the previously calculated `min_date_2023`.
    *   **`AVG(UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(snapshot_date == min_date_2023).tx_limit_daily)`**: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only those snapshots whose `snapshot_date` exactly matches the `min_date_2023` found earlier. It then calculates the average of the `tx_limit_daily` for these specific snapshots.
    *   **`AVG(UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(snapshot_date == min_date_2023).tx_limit_monthly)`**: Similarly, this calculates the average of the `tx_limit_monthly` for the snapshots matching the earliest date in 2023.
    *   **`avg_daily_limit=...`, `avg_monthly_limit=...`**: The calculated averages are assigned to the respective result fields.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This first step accesses the `UserSessions` collection. For each session, it calculates the duration in seconds by finding the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` using the `DATEDIFF` function. It also keeps the `device_type` field, which is needed for grouping later. The result is stored in the `session_durations` variable.
2.  **`avg_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This step takes the `session_durations` collection and partitions it.
    *   `name=""device_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(device_type)`: Specifies that the sessions should be grouped based on their `device_type`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is applied to the result of the partition. For each `device_type` group:
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for the current group.
    *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(UserSessions.duration_secs)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `duration_secs` (calculated in the first step) for all sessions belonging to the current `device_type` group. The `UserSessions.duration_secs` refers back to the `duration_secs` field calculated on the original `UserSessions` collection within the context of the current partition group.

        *   `coupons`: Accesses the coupons associated with the current merchant.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1`: Ranks the coupons for the current merchant (`per=""Merchants""`) based on their `start_date` in ascending order. The `WHERE(...) == 1` clause selects only the coupon with rank 1 (the earliest).

The outer `created_at` refers to `Users.created_at`, and the inner `created_at` refers to `Notifications.created_at`. `DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')` calculates the date exactly one year after the user signed up.
    *   `HAS(...)`: Checks if *any* notification exists that satisfies the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., was created within the first year).
