**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by selecting the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions in total. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer who meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates new fields.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the success rate for each customer.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""completed"". We assume ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for that customer (which we already know is >= 5).
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing customer names and their success rates) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).",18.336873292922974,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG ticker symbols. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in combination with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol`.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering the `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single number representing this count, calculated using `Broker.CALCULATE`.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

)

# Calculate the count of these distinct customers
result = Broker.CALCULATE(

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple (which acts as a list in this context) of FAANG stock ticker symbols for easy reference.
2.  `com_email_faang_investors = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then filters it.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols))) == 1`: This condition checks if the customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It filters the transactions of the customer.
        *   `ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols)`: Within the transaction filter, this checks if the `symbol` of the `ticker` associated with the transaction is present in the `faang_ticker_symbols` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This ensures that there is at least one such transaction for the customer.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two main conditions, meaning a customer must satisfy both to be included in the `com_email_faang_investors` collection.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_distinct_customers = COUNT(com_email_faang_investors))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result. `Broker.CALCULATE` is used because we want a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(com_email_faang_investors)`: This counts the number of customers in the `com_email_faang_investors` collection. Since `com_email_faang_investors` is a collection of customers filtered based on the criteria, counting its members gives the number of distinct customers who meet these criteria.

2.  **Filter for Stock Transactions**: We'll select transactions where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is ""stock"".

3.  **Determine Week and Day Information**: For each relevant transaction, we'll calculate the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. We'll also need the day name using `DAYNAME(date_time)` to identify weekend transactions.

4.  **Group by Week**: The transactions will be partitioned (grouped) by their calculated week start date.

5.  **Calculate Counts**: For each week group:

**Explanation:**

1.  `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` and `current_week_start_date_boundary` define the overall time window: the last 8 full weeks, excluding the current week.
2.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Ensures only transactions related to stocks are considered.
    *   `date_time >= eight_weeks_ago_start_date & date_time < current_week_start_date_boundary`: Restricts transactions to the specified 8-week period.
3.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week'))`: For each filtered transaction, this calculates `transaction_week_start`, which is the starting date of the week the transaction occurred in. This will be used for grouping.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: This groups the transactions based on their `transaction_week_start`. Each group represents one of the 8 weeks.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
    *   `week_start_display = transaction_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for the output.
    *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific week's group.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: First, we establish the date range for ""last week"".
    *   `start_current_week_dt`: Calculates the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_previous_week_dt`: Calculates the start date of the previous week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`).
    These are calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) context.

2.  **Filter Relevant Transactions**:
    *   We start from `Broker` (via `date_info` which holds the calculated dates).
    *   Access `Customers` and filter them using `WHERE(country == ""USA"")` to get only customers from the USA.
    *   Access their `transactions_made`.
    *   Filter these transactions using `WHERE((date_time >= start_previous_week_dt) & (date_time < start_current_week_dt))`. This ensures transactions occurred on or after the start of last week and before the start of the current week. This collection of filtered transactions is assigned to `relevant_transactions`.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates**:
    *   Finally, we use `Broker.CALCULATE` again to compute the required aggregates from the `relevant_transactions`.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(relevant_transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions that meet the criteria.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(relevant_transactions.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field of these transactions.

    *   Select the `transaction_ticker_symbol` (renaming it to `ticker_symbol` for the output).
    *   Count the number of transactions in that group using `COUNT(Transactions)`, naming this count `num_transactions`.
5.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain up to 2 records, each with the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding `num_transactions`.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the relevant period for customer signups. This period starts 6 months prior to the beginning of the current month and ends just before the current month begins.
    *   `start_date_for_signups`: Calculated as the first day of the month, 6 months ago from the current month's start.
    *   `end_date_for_signups`: Calculated as the first day of the current month.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window. For these customers, we extract the year (`signup_yr`) and month (`signup_mth`) of their `join_date`.
3.  **Partition by Signup Month**: The filtered customers are then grouped (partitioned) by their `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`.
4.  **Calculate Metrics per Signup Month**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month group, PMCS is calculated as the total count of customers who signed up in that month (`COUNT(Customers)`).
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month group, PMAT is the average transaction amount. This is calculated by taking all transactions made by all customers who signed up in that specific month and averaging their `amount` (`AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`). If customers in a signup group have no transactions, PMAT will be null.
5.  **Format and Order Results**: The final output will list the `signup_year`, `signup_month`, `PMCS`, and `PMAT` for each month in the defined period, ordered chronologically.

1.  Filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records where the `date` is within the last 7 days, including today. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) < 7`.
2.  For these filtered daily prices, we also need to access the `ticker_type`. This is done by navigating from `DailyPrices` to its related `ticker` (which is a `Tickers` record) and then accessing the `ticker_type` field. We'll calculate this as `tick_type`.
3.  The resulting collection (let's call it `recent_prices_with_type`) contains recent daily price records along with their associated ticker types.
4.  We then `PARTITION` `recent_prices_with_type` by the `tick_type`.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each unique `tick_type`), we `CALCULATE` the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key) and the `ACP`. The `ACP` is the average of the `close` prices of the `DailyPrices` records that fall into that specific ticker type group and time frame.

```python
