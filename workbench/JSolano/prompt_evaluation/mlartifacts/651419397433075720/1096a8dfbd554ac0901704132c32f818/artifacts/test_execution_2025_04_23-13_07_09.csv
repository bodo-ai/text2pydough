**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it calculates:
    *   `cust_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `total_transactions`: Counts all transactions linked to the customer via the `transactions_made` relationship.
    *   `successful_transactions`: Counts only the transactions linked to the customer where the `status` field is exactly 'COMPLETED'.

2.  **`customer_success_rates = customer_transaction_stats.WHERE(...)`**: This line takes the results from the previous step and applies filters and further calculations:
    *   **`.WHERE(total_transactions >= 5)`**: Filters the results to include only those customers who have 5 or more total transactions (as calculated in the previous step).
    *   **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Calculates the final required fields for the filtered customers:
        *   `customer_name`: Selects the customer's name (carried over as `cust_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculates the success rate as `(successful_transactions / total_transactions) * 100.0`. The `IFF` function ensures we don't divide by zero, although the `WHERE` clause already guarantees `total_transactions` is at least 5. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures floating-point division for a percentage.
    *   **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results based on the calculated `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

3.  **`result = customer_success_rates`**: Assigns the final ordered results to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE total and successful transactions per customer

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: A Python tuple `faang_symbols` is defined to hold the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to modify if needed.
2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
3.  **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
4.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`**: This is the second part of the filter condition, combined with the first using `&` (AND).

    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: Filters these transactions, keeping only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed by navigating from the transaction to its linked ticker) is present in the `faang_symbols` tuple. The `ISIN` function checks for membership in the list.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the customer has at least one transaction that passed the inner `WHERE` filter (i.e., at least one FAANG stock transaction).
5.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs the final aggregation.
    *   `Broker`: We use the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single, aggregated result (the total count).
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: Counts the number of distinct customer records remaining after applying the combined filter conditions in the `filtered_customers` variable.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_limits = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the date boundaries for our analysis using the top-level `Broker` collection.
    *   `start_date_limit`: Determines the beginning of the 8-week period by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), finding the start of its week (`'start of week'`), and subtracting 8 weeks (`'-8 weeks'`).
    *   `end_date_limit`: Determines the end of the period (exclusive) by finding the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`). This ensures we exclude the current week.
2.  **`transaction_info = date_limits.Transactions.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection (accessed via the `date_limits` context which passes down the calculated dates).
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: Filters the transactions based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   `ticker.ticker_type == 'stock'`: Ensures only transactions involving stocks are considered by checking the `ticker_type` of the associated `ticker`.
        *   `date_time >= start_date_limit`: Includes transactions on or after the start date of our 8-week window.
        *   `date_time < end_date_limit`: Includes transactions before the start date of the current week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates two new fields for each filtered transaction:
        *   `transaction_week_start`: Finds the starting date of the week the transaction occurred in using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
        *   `is_weekend_transaction`: Creates a boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the transaction's day name (`DAYNAME(date_time)`) is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using `ISIN`.
3.  **`weekly_stock_transaction_stats = transaction_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`**: We process the `transaction_info` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_groups"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the transactions into weekly buckets based on the `transaction_week_start` calculated previously.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week_start_date = transaction_week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (which is the partition key).
        *   `total_stock_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction` flag for all transactions in the group. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0, this effectively counts the weekend transactions.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly results chronologically based on the `week_start_date`.

**Explanation:**

    *   `start_of_last_week = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '- 7 days')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the *previous* week by taking the start of the current week and subtracting 7 days.
2.  **`us_transactions_last_week = date_info.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection within the context of `date_info` (so we can use `start_of_last_week` and `start_of_current_week`). We then filter these transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week) & (date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Selects transactions whose `date_time` falls within the calculated range for last week (from the start of last week up to, but not including, the start of the current week).
3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we perform aggregations at the `Broker` level on the filtered `us_transactions_last_week` collection:
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(us_transactions_last_week)`: Counts the total number of transactions that met the criteria.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(us_transactions_last_week.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all the filtered transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Recent Buys:**
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   `transaction_type == 'BUY'`: Ensures we only consider purchase transactions.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: Filters transactions that occurred within the last 10 days from the current time (`DATETIME('now')`). `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days.
    *   A `CALCULATE` clause is used immediately after filtering to create a temporary field `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` record (`ticker.symbol`). This makes the symbol readily available for partitioning.

2.  **Partition and Count:**
    *   The filtered and prepared transactions (`recent_buy_transactions`) are then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""symbol_groups"", by=ticker_symbol)`. This groups the transactions based on their `ticker_symbol`.
    *   Following the `PARTITION`, a `CALCULATE` operation is performed on these groups:
        *   `symbol=ticker_symbol`: Selects the ticker symbol (which was the partition key).
        *   `num_buy_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of transaction records within each partition group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol).

3.  **Select Top 2:**
    *   The `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` function is applied to the result of the partition and count (`symbol_buy_counts`).
    *   It selects the top 2 records (`k=2`).
    *   The ranking is based on the `num_buy_transactions` field in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning the symbols with the highest counts come first.

4.  **Final Result:**
    *   The variable `result` holds the final output, which contains the ticker symbol and the corresponding number of buy transactions for the two most frequently bought stocks in the last 10 days.","# Step 1: Filter transactions to include only 'BUY' types within the last 10 days

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Range:** We first define the `start_date_range` (start of the month 6 months ago) and `end_date_range` (start of the current month) using the `DATETIME` function. This ensures we capture the last 6 full months.
2.  **Filter Customers:** We filter the `Customers` collection using `WHERE` to select only those whose `join_date` falls within our defined 6-month window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month/Year:** We use `CALCULATE` to extract the `signup_year` and `signup_month` from the `join_date` for each selected customer. This is needed for grouping.
4.  **Partition by Month:** We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered customers based on their `signup_year` and `signup_month`. Each partition (`monthly_signups`) represents a specific month within our 6-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics:** Within each monthly partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   `signup_month_formatted`: We create a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent formatting.
    *   `pmcs`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups by counting the number of `Customers` within the current partition using `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   `pmat`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction amount by taking the `AVG` of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within the current partition.
6.  **Final Selection and Ordering:** We use a final `CALCULATE` to select only the `signup_month_formatted`, `pmcs`, and `pmat` fields as requested. We then use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results chronologically by the signup month.","# Define the start and end dates for the 6-MONTH window preceding the current MONTH

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Recent Prices:** The code starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection. It filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') <= 6`.
2.  **Include Ticker Type:** Within the same step, `CALCULATE` is used to select the `close` price (renamed to `closing_price` for clarity, though not strictly necessary for the final calculation) and, crucially, retrieves the `ticker_type` by navigating the relationship `ticker.ticker_type`. This associates each relevant price record with its ticker type.
3.  **Partition by Type:** The filtered data (`recent_prices_data`) is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(ticker_type))`. This groups the records based on the unique values of `ticker_type`.
4.  **Calculate Average per Type:** Finally, another `CALCULATE` is applied to the partitioned data. For each partition group (i.e., for each `ticker_type`), it calculates the Average Closing Price (`ACP`) using `AVG(DailyPrices.close)`. This averages the `close` prices of all the `DailyPrices` records that fell into that specific `ticker_type` group during the partitioning step.
5.  **Output:** The `result` variable holds the final output, containing each distinct `ticker_type` and its corresponding `ACP` calculated over the specified 7-day period.","# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days (inclusive of today)
# DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') <= 6 ensures we include today (diff=0) and the previous 6 days.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_joined_2022 = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`**: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the year 2022.
2.  **`customers_by_country = customers_joined_2022.PARTITION(name=""country_partition"", by=(country))`**: This partitions the filtered customers (those who joined in 2022) into groups based on their `country`. Each partition represents a unique country found among these customers.
3.  **`ar_by_country = customers_by_country.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates metrics for each country partition:
    *   `country_name=country`: Selects the country name (the partition key).
    *   `total_customers_in_country = COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the total number of customers within the current country partition (all of whom joined in 2022).
    *   `active_customers_in_country = COUNT(Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`: Counts the customers within the current country partition who have made at least one transaction (i.e., are ""active""). `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` checks if the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty for a customer.
    *   `activity_ratio = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio (AR) using the formula provided: `(Active Customers / Total Customers) * 100`. The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country` might be zero (although unlikely after the initial filter unless a country had 0 joiners in 2022) to prevent division by zero, assigning an AR of 0.0 in that case. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division for the percentage.
4.  **`result = ar_by_country.CALCULATE(country=country_name, AR=activity_ratio)`**: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the required output fields (`country` and `AR`) and renames `country_name` to `country` and `activity_ratio` to `AR` as requested in the output specification.","# Filter customers who joined in 2022

**Explanation:**

1.  **`one_month_ago = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`**: Defines a variable `one_month_ago` representing the date and time exactly one month before the current moment. This is used to filter transactions within the desired time frame.
2.  **`ticker_calculations = Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This part starts with the `Tickers` collection.
    *   The first `CALCULATE` selects the `symbol` (renamed to `ticker_symbol`) and creates a temporary collection `relevant_transactions` for each ticker. This sub-collection contains only the transactions associated with that ticker (`transactions_of`) that meet two conditions:
        *   `transaction_type == 'SELL'`: Only sell transactions are included.
        *   `date_time >= one_month_ago`: Only transactions from the last month (inclusive of one month ago) are included.
    *   The second `CALCULATE` operates on the result of the first. It keeps `ticker_symbol` and calculates three aggregate sums based on the `relevant_transactions` for each ticker: `total_sell_amount`, `total_tax`, and `total_commission`.
3.  **`result = ticker_calculations.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` takes the results from the previous step.
    *   It selects the `ticker_symbol`.
    *   It calculates the `spm` (Selling Profit Margin) using the provided formula: `(Total Amount - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`.
    *   The `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_sell_amount` might be zero (if there were no relevant sell transactions for a ticker), preventing a division-by-zero error and assigning an SPM of `0.0` in such cases. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure the result is a percentage and uses floating-point arithmetic.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info`**: We start with `DailyPrices` and calculate a `month_str` (like ""YYYY-MM"") for grouping and retrieve the `symbol` from the related `ticker`. We also select the relevant price fields (`close`, `high`, `low`) and give them temporary names to avoid ambiguity later.
2.  **`ticker_groups`**: We partition the `price_info` by `symbol`. This creates groups, where each group contains all daily price records for a single ticker. The partition is named `""tickers""`.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: We then access the daily price records *within* each ticker group (`ticker_groups.DailyPrices`) and partition *these* by the calculated `month_str`. This creates subgroups for each month within each ticker. This partition is named `""months""`.
4.  **`monthly_stats`**: For each ticker-month group (`monthly_groups`), we calculate the required aggregates: `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`. We access the daily prices for the specific month using `DailyPrices` within the `CALCULATE` context, referencing the fields calculated in `price_info`. We also carry forward the `symbol` and `month` identifiers.
5.  **`monthly_stats_with_prev`**: Now, working with the `monthly_stats` collection (which has one row per ticker-month), we use the `PREV` window function.
    *   `PREV(avg_close, ...)`: We want the `avg_close` from the previous record.
    *   `by=month.ASC()`: The ""previous"" record is determined by sorting the months in ascending order.
    *   `per=""tickers""`: Crucially, this ensures `PREV` operates *within* each ticker group defined by the outer `ticker_groups` partition. It finds the previous month's average *for the same ticker*.
    *   `default=None`: If there's no previous month (i.e., the first month record for a ticker), `PREV` will return `None`.
6.  **`result`**: Finally, we calculate the Month-over-Month Change (`momc`).
    *   We use `IFF` to check if `prev_avg_close` is not `None` and not zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   If the condition is true, we calculate `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
    *   Otherwise, `momc` is set to `None`.
    *   We select the final required columns: `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, and the calculated `momc`.
    *   The result is ordered by `symbol` and `month` for clarity.","# Step 1: CALCULATE MONTH string and get ticker symbol for each daily price record

The `HAS(...) == 1` condition ensures we only process tickers with relevant data.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each qualifying ticker:
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: We select the stock's symbol.
    *   `price_change=...`: We calculate the price change. This is done by:
        *   Filtering the `historical_prices` again for the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"".
        *   Finding the `MAX` of the `high` prices within that range for the specific ticker.
        *   Finding the `MIN` of the `low` prices within that range for the specific ticker.
        *   Subtracting the minimum low from the maximum high to get the total price range (change) for that period.
3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: We take the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which contains `ticker_symbol` and `price_change` for each relevant ticker) and select the top 3 records based on the `price_change` field in descending order (highest change first).

1.  **`customer_signup_month_txns = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it calculates three new fields:
    *   `cust_id`: Stores the customer's unique identifier (`_id`).
    *   `cust_name`: Stores the customer's name (`name`).
    *   `signup_tx_count`: This calculates the number of transactions made by the customer that occurred within the same calendar year and month as their `join_date`. It does this by:
        *   Accessing the `transactions_made` sub-collection for the customer.
        *   Filtering these transactions using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the transaction's `date_time` match the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the customer's `join_date`.
        *   Counting the remaining transactions using `COUNT()`.

2.  **`top_customer_by_signup_txns = customer_signup_month_txns.TOP_K(...)`**: This line takes the results from the previous step (a collection of customers with their respective signup month transaction counts) and selects the top 1 record based on the `signup_tx_count` in descending order (`DESC()`). This effectively finds the customer who made the most transactions in their signup month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Transactions` collection and filters it to include only transactions that occurred between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, inclusive. We use `DATETIME` to specify the date boundaries and ensure the comparison works correctly with the `date_time` field. Using `< DATETIME('2023-04-01')` is a common way to include the entire end date (March 31st).
2.  **`partitioned_by_type = filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on the unique values in the `transaction_type` field. Each group (named `type_groups` internally, though the name isn't strictly needed for the subsequent `CALCULATE`) contains all transactions of a specific type within the date range.
3.  **`type_stats = partitioned_by_type.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition group created previously.
    *   `tx_type=transaction_type`: Selects the transaction type (which is the partition key).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers`**: Starts with the `Customers` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(transactions_made) == 1)`**: Filters the customers.

The `DATEDIFF` function calculates the difference in days between '2023-04-01' and the record's `date`. We keep records where this difference is 0 or greater.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""ticker_groups"", by=(ticker_id))`**: This partitions the filtered price records into groups based on their `ticker_id`. Each group will contain records associated with a unique `ticker_id`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`**: After partitioning, this `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group. Since `ticker_id` was used as the partitioning key (`by=(ticker_id)`), we can directly select it here. This effectively extracts the unique `ticker_id` from each partition group.

    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the `symbol` field from the `Tickers` collection and renames it to `ticker_symbol`.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_of)`: Counts the number of related transaction records for each ticker using the `transactions_of` sub-collection and the `COUNT` aggregation function.
    *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field from all related transactions for each ticker using the `transactions_of` sub-collection and the `SUM` aggregation function.
2.  **`.TOP_K(10, by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`**: This function selects the top 10 records from the result of the `CALCULATE` step.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, it accesses the related `customer` and `ticker` information to extract the `state` of the customer and the `ticker_type` of the ticker. These are stored in new fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`state_ticker_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection into groups. Each group represents a unique combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. The groups are named `state_ticker_combos`.
3.  **`combo_counts = state_ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each unique combination (group), it calculates:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Transactions` collection and calculates a new field `sender_country`. It uses the `IFF` function to check the `sender_type`: if it's 1 (User), it takes the country from the linked `sending_user`; otherwise (if it's 2, Merchant), it takes the country from the linked `sending_merchant`. It also retains the `created_at` and `amount` fields for subsequent filtering and aggregation.
2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 30)`**: This filters the `transaction_info` collection to include only transactions where the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. This effectively selects transactions from the past 30 days, inclusive of the 30th day ago.
3.  **`transaction_info.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=sender_country)`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on the calculated `sender_country`. Each partition (`country_groups`) contains all transactions from a specific country within the last 30 days.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition (each country group).
    *   `country_name = sender_country`: Selects the country name, which is the key used for partitioning.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within the current country group (partition).
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within the current country group.
5.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` (one row per country with its stats) and selects the top 5 rows based on the `total_transaction_amount`, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC`).

result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    lowest_vti_close_last_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these records based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   **`ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`**: This condition filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol (accessed via the `ticker` relationship) is exactly 'VTI'.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 7`**: This condition filters for records where the date (`date` field) is within the last 7 days. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, ...)` calculates the number of full days between the record's date and now. The `<= 7` ensures we include records from today up to 7 days ago.
2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs a calculation at the top level of the graph (`Broker`).
    *   **`lowest_vti_close_last_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`**: It calculates a single value named `lowest_vti_close_last_7_days`. This value is determined by applying the `MIN()` aggregation function to the `close` field of the previously filtered `vti_prices_last_7_days` collection, effectively finding the minimum closing price among those records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start a calculation at the top level of the `Ewallet` graph because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of transactions).
2.  **`num_transactions=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_transactions` which will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Users` collection and filter it.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70`**: This is the filter condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)` calculates the difference in days between the user's `join_date` and the current timestamp.
    *   `<= 70` selects only those users whose join date is 70 days ago or less.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to include only those customers who have at least one transaction record in their `transactions_made` sub-collection. This satisfies the requirement to ignore customers without transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each customer.
2.  **`num_transactions=COUNT(...)`**: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define `num_transactions`. This counts the transactions for the *current* customer (`transactions_made`) that meet specific criteria.
3.  **`transactions_made.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the customer's transactions.
4.  **`(transaction_type == 'SELL')`**: The first condition filters for transactions where the `transaction_type` is 'SELL'.
5.  **`(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day') == '2023-04-01')`**: The second condition filters for transactions that occurred on '2023-04-01'. We use `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` to truncate the `date_time` timestamp to midnight, allowing for a direct comparison with the date string '2023-04-01'.
6.  **`cust_id=_id, cust_name=name`**: We also select the customer's `_id` and `name`, renaming them to `cust_id` and `cust_name` respectively.
7.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions.DESC())`**: After calculating the number of relevant transactions for *all* customers, we use `TOP_K` to select only the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `num_transactions` (ordered descending with `.DESC()`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`tx_info`)**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   `status == 'COMPLETED'`: Selects only successful transactions.
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for the year 2023.
        *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for months January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` extracts the `tx_year` and `tx_month` from the `date_time` for grouping purposes and retains the `price` needed for the final average calculation.

2.  **Partition by Month (`monthly_groups`)**:
    *   We take the filtered and prepared data (`tx_info`) and apply `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""monthly_tx_groups""` assigns a name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(tx_year, tx_month)` specifies that the transactions should be grouped based on unique combinations of year and month.

3.  **Calculate Monthly Average (`result`)**:
    *   We operate on the partitioned data (`monthly_groups`).
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to define the output fields for each group:
        *   `year=tx_year`: Includes the year of the group.
        *   `month=tx_month`: Includes the month of the group.
        *   `average_transaction_price=AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all original `Transactions` belonging to the current year/month partition group.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())` sorts the final results first by year and then by month in ascending order.","import pydough

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates two key date boundaries using the top-level `Dealership` graph:
    *   `start_current_week`: Finds the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_window`: Finds the start date of the week that was 8 weeks before the start of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')`.

2.  **`payment_info = date_boundaries.Sales...CALCULATE(...)`**: This chain performs several operations:
    *   Starts from the `date_boundaries` context (to access the calculated dates).
    *   Navigates to `Sales` and filters them using `WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`.
    *   Accesses the associated payments for these high-value sales using `.payment`.
    *   Filters these payments using `WHERE(...)` to keep only those whose `payment_date` falls within the desired 8-week window (greater than or equal to `start_of_window` and less than `start_current_week`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to derive two new fields for each filtered payment:
        *   `payment_week_start`: Calculates the start date of the week the payment occurred in using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
        *   `is_weekend_flag`: Creates a flag (1 if weekend, 0 otherwise). It uses `DAYOFWEEK(payment_date)` to get the day number (assuming Sunday=1, Saturday=7) and `ISIN` to check if it's 1 or 7. `IFF` sets the flag accordingly.

3.  **`weekly_stats = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This step groups the `payment_info` records:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=payment_week_start)`: Groups the payments based on their `payment_week_start` date. Each group represents a unique week within the 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each week group:
        *   `week = payment_week_start`: Selects the week's start date.
        *   `total_payments_received = COUNT(payment_info)`: Counts the total number of payments within that week's group by counting the records from the source collection (`payment_info`) belonging to the partition.
        *   `weekend_payments_received = SUM(payment_info.is_weekend_flag)`: Sums the `is_weekend_flag` for all payments in that week's group to get the count of weekend payments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`thirty_days_ago = DATETIME('now', '-29 days', 'start of day')`**: This line defines a contextless expression to calculate the date 29 days before the current date, truncated to the start of that day (midnight). This effectively sets the beginning of our 30-day window (inclusive of today).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_filtered = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`: It filters the cars to include only those where the `vin_number`, converted to uppercase for case-insensitivity, contains the substring 'M5'. The `%` wildcards allow 'M5' to appear anywhere in the VIN.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, it calculates necessary fields:
        *   `upper_make=UPPER(make)` and `upper_model=UPPER(model)`: These create uppercase versions of the make and model, which will be used for case-insensitive grouping in the next step.
        *   `original_make=make` and `original_model=model`: These preserve the original make and model names for the final output.

2.  **`model_groups = cars_filtered.PARTITION(...)`**: This step partitions (groups) the `cars_filtered` results.
    *   `name=""car_model_group""`: Assigns a name to the collection of groups created.
    *   `by=(upper_make, upper_model)`: Groups the cars based on the combination of their uppercase make and model. This ensures that variations in capitalization (e.g., ""Honda Civic"" vs. ""honda civic"") are treated as the same model group.

3.  **`result = model_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the final output for each group created by the partition.
    *   `car_make=MIN(Cars.original_make)`: Since partitioning was done by uppercase make/model, multiple original casings might exist within a group (e.g., ""Ford"" and ""FORD""). `MIN(Cars.original_make)` selects *one* representative original make name from the cars within the current group (typically the alphabetically first one).
    *   `car_model=MIN(Cars.original_model)`: Similarly, selects a representative original model name for the group.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: This counts the total number of sales records (`sale_records`) associated with *all* the cars belonging to the current make/model group (which also met the initial VIN filter criteria). `Cars.sale_records` refers to the sales records linked to the cars within the context of the current partition group.
    *   `.WHERE(num_sales > 0)`: This final filter ensures that only make/model groups that actually have associated sales (after the VIN filtering) are included in the result.","# Step 1: Filter cars whose VIN CONTAINS 'M5' (case-insensitive)

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Count the number of sales and calculate the total revenue for Toyota cars sold in the last 30 days (inclusive of today).
2.  **Collections Needed:** `Sales` (for sale date and price) and `Cars` (linked from `Sales` to filter by make).
3.  **Filtering Criteria:**
    *   Car make must be 'Toyota' (`Sales.car.make == 'Toyota'`).
    *   Sale date must be within the last 30 days, including today. We can use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`. This checks if the difference between the sale date and now is 29 days or less (0 days difference means today, 29 days difference means 30 days ago).
4.  **Calculations Needed:**
    *   Count the number of sales records matching the criteria.
    *   Sum the `sale_price` for these records.
5.  **Output:** A single result containing the count (`num_sales`) and the sum (`total_revenue`). A `Dealership.CALCULATE` is suitable for this top-level aggregation.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Filter sales for Toyota cars within the last 30 days
recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(
    (car.make == 'Toyota') &
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29)
)

# Calculate the total count and revenue from the filtered sales
result = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    num_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales),
    total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == 'Toyota'`: It checks if the `make` of the `car` associated with the sale is 'Toyota'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: It calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition `<= 29` ensures we include sales from today (0 days difference) up to 30 days ago (29 days difference).
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions, so only sales records meeting both criteria are kept in the `recent_toyota_sales` intermediate collection.
2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs the final aggregation at the top `Dealership` level.
    *   `num_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales)`: It counts the number of records in the filtered `recent_toyota_sales` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_stats = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, it calculates:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name and assigns it to `sp_first_name`.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name and assigns it to `sp_last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales records found in the `sales_made` sub-collection associated with the current salesperson. This gives the total sales amount for that salesperson.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for the current salesperson. This gives the total number of sales made by that salesperson.
2.  **`result = salesperson_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the intermediate `salesperson_stats` collection (which now has names, total sales, and number of sales per salesperson) and performs a final calculation:
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`: Selects the first name calculated previously.
    *   `last_name=sp_last_name`: Selects the last name calculated previously.
    *   `total_sales=total_sales_amount`: Selects the total sales amount calculated previously (renamed for clarity).
    *   `number_of_sales=num_sales`: Selects the number of sales calculated previously (renamed for clarity).
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson within the `salesperson_stats` collection. The ranking is based on the `total_sales_amount` field, ordered from highest sales amount (rank 1) to lowest.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_status = Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Cars` collection and calculates necessary intermediate information for each car:
    *   `make`, `model`: Selects the make and model.
    *   `latest_inventory_status`: Determines the inventory status from the *most recent* snapshot. It uses `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1` to identify the latest snapshot for each car (`per=""Cars""` ensures ranking is done independently for each car's snapshots). `SINGULAR()` is used because the ranking guarantees only one latest snapshot per car. `DEFAULT_TO(..., False)` handles cases where a car might have no inventory snapshots, treating them as not in inventory.
    *   `has_sales_flag`: Checks if the car has at least one associated sale record using `HAS(sale_records) == 1`.

2.  **`sold_and_not_in_inventory_cars = cars_with_status.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the results from the previous step to keep only those cars that meet both conditions:
    *   `has_sales_flag == True`: The car must have been sold.
    *   `latest_inventory_status == False`: The car must not be in inventory according to its latest snapshot.

3.  **`make_model_max_price = sold_and_not_in_inventory_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: This step groups the filtered cars based on their `make` and `model`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""make_model_groups"", by=(make, model))`: Creates groups for each unique combination of make and model.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (each make/model combination):
        *   `make=make, model=model`: Includes the make and model in the output.
        *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the maximum `sale_price` by looking at all `sale_records` associated with the `Cars` that fall into the current `make` and `model` partition group.

4.  **`result = make_model_max_price.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, this sorts the resulting make/model groups based on their calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first).","# Step 1: CALCULATE the latest inventory status for each car

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Cars` collection and applying filters using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%') | LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: This condition filters for cars where the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'.
    *   `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
    *   `LIKE` with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching (finding 'Ford' within 'Ford Motor Company' or 'Mustang' within 'Shelby Mustang GT').
    *   `|` represents the logical OR operator.
3.  **`& (HAS(sale_records) == 1)`**: This condition further filters the results to include only those cars that have at least one associated sale record in the `sale_records` sub-collection. This is necessary to calculate a meaningful average sale price. `&` represents the logical AND operator.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.
    *   `make=make`, `model=model`, `year=year`, `color=color`, `vin_number=vin_number`: These select the specified car details.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field within the car's `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range:** We first calculate the `start_date` and `end_date` for the required period (last 6 months excluding the current month) using the `DATETIME` function. `end_date` is the first day of the current month, and `start_date` is exactly 6 months prior.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data:** We filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales that occurred within the calculated date range (`>= start_date` and `< end_date`). We then use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Create a `sale_month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format for easy grouping.
    *   Extract the `salesperson_hire_year` from the related salesperson record.
    *   Include `sale_price` and `_id` for later calculations.
3.  **Partition by Month:** We partition the prepared `sales_info` data by `sale_month`. This creates groups for each month within the 6-month period that had at least one sale (regardless of which salesperson made it).
4.  **Calculate Conditional Metrics:** Within the `CALCULATE` applied to the `monthly_groups` partition:
    *   We define a boolean condition `is_relevant_sale` which is true only if the sale was made by a salesperson hired in 2022 or 2023.
    *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) is calculated by counting the records (`_id`) only where `is_relevant_sale` is true, using `COUNT(KEEP_IF(...))`.
    *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated by summing the `sale_price` only where `is_relevant_sale` is true, using `SUM(KEEP_IF(...))`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if no relevant sales occurred in a month, the PMSR is 0.0 instead of null.
5.  **Final Selection and Ordering:** We use a final `CALCULATE` to select only the required output fields (`month`, `PMSPS`, `PMSR`) and then use `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` to sort the results chronologically by month.

This approach correctly filters for the specified salespersons and time period, calculates the required metrics, includes months with zero metrics for the target group (as long as *some* sale happened in that month overall), and orders the result as requested.","# Define the date range boundaries

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`is_q1_2023_sale = (YEAR(sale_date) == 2023) & ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), (1, 2, 3))`**: This line defines a reusable boolean expression (a contextless expression) named `is_q1_2023_sale`. It checks if the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023 (`YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`) AND if the month is January, February, or March (`ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), (1, 2, 3))`).
2.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the calculation from the top-level `Dealership` graph because we want a single, aggregated result (the overall ASP for Q1 2023).
3.  **`asp_q1_2023=AVG(Sales.WHERE(is_q1_2023_sale).sale_price)`**: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `asp_q1_2023`.
    *   `Sales.WHERE(is_q1_2023_sale)`: This filters the `Sales` collection, keeping only the records where the `is_q1_2023_sale` condition is true.
    *   `.sale_price`: From the filtered sales records, we select the `sale_price` field.
    *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` aggregation function calculates the average of the `sale_price` values obtained from the filtered sales records. This gives us the Average Sale Price for Q1 2023.","# Define a filter for sales occurring in the first quarter (months 1, 2, 3) of 2023

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_data_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `Dealership` level to calculate aggregate values across all relevant sales.
    *   `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` year is 2023. Then, it sums the `sale_price` for these filtered sales to get the total revenue for 2023.
    *   `total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`: Similarly, this filters sales for 2023, accesses the associated `car` for each sale, and sums their `cost` to get the total cost of goods sold in 2023.
2.  **`result = sales_data_2023.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the result of the first one. This is necessary because the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` fields are only available *after* the first `CALCULATE` completes.
    *   `gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`: This line applies the Gross Profit Margin formula using the previously calculated total revenue and total cost. We multiply by `100.0` to express the result as a percentage and ensure floating-point arithmetic.

The final `result` variable will contain a single record with the calculated `gpm_2023`.","# CALCULATE total revenue and total cost for sales in 2023

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Sales` collection.
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each `Sale`, we access its associated `car` and then the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
3.  **`(snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False)`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause applied to `inventory_snapshots`, we check two conditions:
    *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: The inventory snapshot date must match the sale date.
    *   `is_in_inventory == False`: The snapshot must indicate the car is *not* in inventory.
4.  **`HAS(...) == 1`**: The `HAS` function checks if at least one inventory snapshot exists for the car that meets both conditions (i.e., the car was marked as out of inventory on the same day it was sold). Only sales meeting this criterion are kept in `relevant_sales`.
5.  **`highest_priced_sale = relevant_sales.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`**: From the filtered `relevant_sales`, we use `TOP_K(1, ...)` to select the single record (`k=1`) that has the highest `sale_price`. `DESC()` ensures we get the maximum value.
6.  **`result = highest_priced_sale.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, for the single highest-priced sale found, we use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields:
    *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` from the associated `car`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payments_with_month = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step preprocesses the `PaymentsReceived` collection. It creates a new field `year_month_key` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `payment_date`. This key serves as a unique identifier for each month (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02""). It also explicitly includes `payment_amount` so it's available for the next steps.
2.  **`monthly_groups = payments_with_month.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the data based on the `year_month_key`. All payment records from the same month are grouped together. The partition is named `monthly_data`.
3.  **`monthly_totals = monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each monthly group created by the partition.
    *   `calc_month=year_month_key`: Selects the month identifier for the output.
    *   `calc_total_payment=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records within the *current* month's partition group. This gives the total payments received for that specific month.
4.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final calculation step computes the Month-over-Month (MoM) change.
    *   `month=calc_month`: Renames `calc_month` to `month` for the final output.
    *   `total_payment=calc_total_payment`: Renames `calc_total_payment` to `total_payment`.
    *   `mom_change=calc_total_payment - PREV(calc_total_payment, by=calc_month.ASC(), default=0.0)`: This calculates the MoM change.
        *   `PREV(calc_total_payment, by=calc_month.ASC(), default=0.0)`: This is a window function that retrieves the `calc_total_payment` value from the *previous* row, based on ascending order of `calc_month`. For the very first month in the dataset, there's no previous month, so `default=0.0` is used.
        *   The difference between the current month's total (`calc_total_payment`) and the previous month's total (obtained via `PREV`) gives the MoM change.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results chronologically by month.

This query effectively groups payments by month, calculates the total for each month, and then computes the difference between each month's total and the preceding month's total. It addresses the core requirements of the request based on the available payment data. Note that this will only include months where at least one payment was received; months with zero payments will not appear in the result unless they happen to be the month immediately following a month with payments (in which case the `PREV` function would retrieve the prior month's value, but the current month's total would be implicitly zero if not present in `monthly_totals`, leading to potentially unexpected MoM results depending on exact `PREV` behavior with missing rows - the current implementation assumes `monthly_totals` contains all relevant months derived from `PaymentsReceived`).","# Step 1: Add a year-MONTH identifier to each payment record
payments_with_month = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(

1.  `Salespersons`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection, as we want to find information *about* salespersons.

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HASNOT(sale_records)` function, which returns `True` for cars that do not have any associated records in the `sale_records` sub-collection (meaning they have never been sold). We compare the result to `1` (PyDough's representation for True).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this selects and renames the required fields for the cars that have no sales records:
    *   `car_id=_id`: Selects the car's unique identifier (`_id`) and renames it to `car_id`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` field and renames it to `car_make`.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` field and renames it to `car_model`.
    *   `car_year=year`: Selects the `year` field and renames it to `car_year`.

The final result `cars_without_sales` contains the ID, make, model, and year for all cars that have no corresponding entries in the `Sales` collection.","cars_without_sales = Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it.

This effectively selects only those customers who have made one or more purchases.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: This takes the filtered list of customers and selects only their unique identifier (`_id`), renaming it to `customer_id` in the final output as requested.

1.  **Goal:** Find the unique IDs (`_id`) of salespersons who were involved in at least one sale that received a payment via 'Cash'.
2.  **Collections Involved:** We need `Salespersons`, `Sales` (accessed via `sales_made` from `Salespersons`), and `PaymentsReceived` (accessed via `payment` from `Sales`).
3.  **Relationships:**
    *   `Salespersons` -> `Sales` (via `sales_made`)
    *   `Sales` -> `PaymentsReceived` (via `payment`)
4.  **Filtering Logic:** We need to filter `Salespersons` based on a condition within their related `PaymentsReceived` records. Specifically, we need to check if any payment associated with any of their sales has `payment_method == 'Cash'`.
5.  **PyDough Implementation:**
    *   Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Use `WHERE` to filter these salespersons.
    *   Inside the `WHERE`, use `HAS` to check for the existence of related records meeting the criteria.
    *   The path to check is `sales_made.payment`. We need to filter these payments: `sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')`.
    *   So the condition becomes `HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')) == 1`.
    *   Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select only the `_id` of the filtered salespersons, renaming it to `salesperson_id` as requested.

```python
# Find salesperson IDs involved in sales with cash payments
salespersons_with_cash_payments = Salespersons.WHERE(
    # Check if the salesperson has at least one sale...
    HAS(
        # ...where that sale has at least one payment...
        sales_made.payment.WHERE(
            # ...and that payment method is 'Cash'
            payment_method == 'Cash'
        )
    ) == 1 # Ensure at least one such payment exists for the salesperson
).CALCULATE(
    # Select the salesperson's ID
    salesperson_id = _id
)

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = salespersons_with_cash_payments
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(...)`: We filter this collection to keep only the salespersons who meet the specified condition.
3.  `HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')) == 1`: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with each salesperson.
    *   `.payment`: For each sale, accesses the list of payments received for that sale.
    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')`: Filters these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is 'Cash'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if, after navigating through `sales_made` and `payment` and applying the filter, there is at least one resulting 'Cash' payment record associated with the salesperson.
4.  `.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = _id)`: For the salespersons who pass the filter, we select their unique identifier (`_id`) and rename it to `salesperson_id` in the final output. Since we are filtering the `Salespersons` collection directly by their `_id`, the resulting list of IDs will be distinct.","# Find salesperson IDs involved in sales with cash payments

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection, which contains information about all sales staff.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made) == 1)`**: We filter this collection using the `WHERE` clause. The `HASNOT(sales_made)` function checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links salespersons to their sales records) is empty for each salesperson. `== 1` confirms that the condition (being empty) is true. This effectively selects only those salespersons who have no associated sales records.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select and format the output. We select the `_id` field and rename it to `salesperson_id`, and also select the `first_name` and `last_name` fields for the filtered salespersons.","inactive_salespersons = Salespersons.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30)) == 1`**: This condition ensures we only consider salespersons who have made at least one sale (`HAS(...) == 1`). The `sales_made` sub-collection is filtered first to include only sales where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required fields:
    *   `salesperson_first_name=first_name`: Renames `first_name` for clarity.
    *   `salesperson_last_name=last_name`: Renames `last_name` for clarity.
    *   `recent_sales_count=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales records for the salesperson, but *only* considering those within the last 30 days (repeating the date filter).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`**: This selects only those customers who have made at least one purchase, ensuring that states without any sales are excluded and that the customer count reflects purchasing customers.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""state_groups"", by=(state))`**: This groups the filtered customers based on their `state`. Each group represents a unique state containing all customers from that state who made purchases.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the required metrics for each state group created by the partition:
    *   `state=state`: Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_unique_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of unique customers within the current state partition. Since we filtered customers with purchases beforehand, this counts unique purchasing customers per state.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Customers.car_purchases.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for the state by summing the `sale_price` from all `car_purchases` associated with the customers in that state group.

3.  **Relevant Collection:** `PaymentsReceived` contains `payment_method` and `payment_amount`.
4.  **Grouping:** We need to group the data by `payment_method`. `PARTITION` is suitable here.
5.  **Aggregations per Group:**
    *   Count the number of payments: `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`
    *   Sum the payment amounts: `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`
6.  **Ranking:** We need the top 3 based on the total amount. `TOP_K` ordered by the sum of `payment_amount` descending is needed.

**Explanation:**

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""methods"", by=(payment_method))`: This first step groups all records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection based on the value in their `payment_method` field. Each resulting group corresponds to a unique payment method.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `payment_method = payment_method`: Selects the payment method itself (which is the key used for partitioning).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**: We first define `start_date_3_months_ago` using `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` to get the date exactly three months prior to the current moment, and `end_date_today` using `DATETIME('now')` for the current moment.
2.  **Start with Salespersons**: The query begins with the `Salespersons` collection as we need information aggregated per salesperson.
3.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to compute derived fields for each salesperson.
    *   `rep_first_name` and `rep_last_name` store the names.
    *   `total_revenue_last_3m`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price` from the `sales_made` sub-collection. Crucially, it first filters `sales_made` using `WHERE` to include only sales where the `sale_date` falls between `start_date_3_months_ago` and `end_date_today` (inclusive).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(termination_date) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is present (not null). This ensures we only consider salespersons who have actually left the company.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates new fields or selects existing ones for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `salesperson_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates a full name by joining the `first_name` and `last_name` with a space.
    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the salesperson's phone number.
    *   `employment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date` in days, representing the total duration of employment.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`**: This selects the single record (`k=1`) that has the minimum value for `employment_duration_days`. The `.ASC()` ensures we are looking for the shortest duration (ascending order).

The final `result` variable will contain the name, phone number, and employment duration (in days) for the salesperson who was employed for the shortest period.","result = Salespersons.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph and use `CALCULATE` to compute a final result.
2.  **`num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_weekend_utility_payments` which will hold the count of the filtered payments.
3.  **`PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsMade` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters for payments made specifically to the vendor named 'Utility Company'.
5.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`**: This condition checks if the payment was made on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., 'Monday', 'Saturday') from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(...)` checks if the extracted day name is present in the tuple `('Saturday', 'Sunday')`.
6.  **`&`**: The ampersand combines the two conditions, ensuring that only payments meeting *both* criteria (correct vendor and weekend date) are included.

# Assign the final result to the variable
result = daily_totals_by_method
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Date Range:**
    *   We first calculate the start of the *current* ISO week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   We truncate this to the start of the day using `DATETIME(..., 'start of day')` to ensure accurate date comparisons, storing it as `start_current_week_day`.
    *   The `start_prev_week` is calculated by subtracting 7 days from `start_current_week_day`.
    *   The `end_prev_week` is calculated by subtracting 1 day from `start_current_week_day`. These calculations define the exact date range for the previous ISO week.

2.  **Filter Payments:**
    *   We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection from the `date_info` context (which contains the calculated dates).
    *   Inside `CALCULATE`, we truncate the `payment_date` to the start of the day (`payment_day`) for consistent comparison with our calculated week boundaries. We also explicitly select `payment_method` as it will be used as a partitioning key.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these payments, keeping only those where `payment_day` falls on or between `start_prev_week` and `end_prev_week`.

3.  **Partition and Aggregate:**
    *   We use `PARTITION` on the filtered payments (`payments_prev_week`).
    *   We partition by `payment_day` and `payment_method` to group payments first by the day they occurred and then by the method used.
    *   Inside the final `CALCULATE`, we select the `payment_day` (renaming it to `payment_date` for clarity), the `payment_method`, and calculate the `total_amount` for each group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`. It's crucial to access the original `PaymentsReceived` collection here to sum the amounts belonging to each specific day/method group created by the partition.

4.  **Order Results:**
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY` sorts the results first by `payment_date` (ascending) and then by `payment_method` (ascending) for a clear and organized output.

5.  **Assign Result:**
    *   The final computed collection is assigned to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE the start and end dates of the previous ISO week

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_data_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection and filters it to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023 using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, we calculate:
    *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `sale_amount=sale_price`: Selects the sale price.
    *   `quarter_start_dt=IFF(...)`: This calculates the first date of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions:
        *   If the month is 1, 2, or 3, it takes the start of the year (`DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of year')`).
        *   If the month is 4, 5, or 6, it takes the start of the year and adds 3 months (`DATETIME(..., '+3 months')`).
        *   If the month is 7, 8, or 9, it adds 6 months.
        *   Otherwise (months 10, 11, 12), it adds 9 months.
3.  **`quarterly_sales_by_state = sales_data_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the `sales_data_2023` collection.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition context.
    *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start_dt)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique combinations of customer state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this calculates the final output fields for each group:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the state for the group.
    *   `quarter_start_date=quarter_start_dt`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
    *   `total_sales=SUM(sales_data_2023.sale_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_amount` for all sales records belonging to the current state-quarter partition group. It accesses the `sale_amount` field from the context of the data being partitioned (`sales_data_2023`).
5.  **`result = quarterly_sales_by_state.ORDER_BY(...)`**: This takes the grouped and aggregated results and sorts them first by `customer_state` in ascending order (`ASC()`) and then by `quarter_start_date` in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_with_ddd` Calculation:**
    *   We start with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments to include only those that have a non-null `end_dt`, as required by the DDD definition to calculate the duration.
    *   `CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days = DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt), drug_id = drug_id)`: Calculates the duration of each treatment in days using `DATEDIFF` and stores it as `treatment_duration_days`. It also keeps the `drug_id` for later grouping.
    *   `WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`: Filters out treatments where the calculated duration is zero or negative (e.g., start and end dates are the same), preventing division by zero when calculating DDD.
    *   `CALCULATE(ddd_value = tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days, drug_id = drug_id)`: Calculates the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each remaining treatment by dividing the `tot_drug_amt` by the `treatment_duration_days`. The `drug_id` is carried over again.

2.  **`avg_ddd_per_drug` Calculation:**
    *   `treatments_with_ddd.PARTITION(name=""drug_treatments"", by=(drug_id))`: Groups the calculated DDD values (`treatments_with_ddd`) by `drug_id`. Each group (`drug_treatments`) contains all the calculated DDDs for a specific drug.
    *   `CALCULATE(drug_name = drug.drug_name, average_ddd = AVG(drug_treatments.ddd_value))`: For each drug group:
        *   `drug_name = drug.drug_name`: Retrieves the actual name of the drug using the `drug_id` partition key to link back to the `Drugs` collection implicitly available via the relationship.
        *   `average_ddd = AVG(drug_treatments.ddd_value)`: Calculates the average of all the `ddd_value`s previously computed for the treatments belonging to this specific drug group.

3.  **`result = avg_ddd_per_drug`:** Assigns the final collection, containing `drug_name` and `average_ddd` for each drug, to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE DDD for each relevant treatment first

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = monthly_patient_counts
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Period:** We first define the time window using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')` to get the start date (first day of the month 3 months ago) and `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the end date (first day of the current month). The period includes treatments on or after the start date and *before* the end date.
2.  **Filter Treatments:** We start with the `Treatments` collection and use `WHERE` to filter treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated `start_period` and `end_period`.
3.  **Extract Information:** Using `CALCULATE`, we extract and transform necessary data for each filtered treatment:
    *   `treatment_month`: Creates a 'YYYY-MM' string from the `start_dt` for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., '09' instead of '9') for correct sorting.
    *   `patient_key`: Retrieves the `patient_id`.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment`: Checks if the `drug_type` associated with the treatment's `drug` is 'biologic', resulting in a True/False value.
4.  **Partition by Month:** We use `PARTITION` on the `treatment_info` collection, grouping the records by the calculated `treatment_month`. This creates groups, one for each month in our 3-month window.
5.  **Calculate Distinct Counts:** We apply `CALCULATE` to the `monthly_groups` partition result:
    *   `month`: Selects the `treatment_month` key for the output.
    *   `total_distinct_patients`: Uses `NDISTINCT(patient_key)` to count the unique patient identifiers within each month's group.
    *   `biologic_distinct_patients`: Uses `NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(patient_key, is_biologic_treatment == True))` to count unique patients who had at least one biologic treatment. `KEEP_IF` ensures that only `patient_key`s associated with a biologic treatment are considered in the distinct count for this field.
6.  **Order Results:** `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the final results chronologically by the month string.
7.  **Assign Result:** The final calculated and ordered data is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Define the start and end dates for the 3-MONTH period before the current MONTH

2.  **`num_patients_gmail_or_yahoo = COUNT(...)`**: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `num_patients_gmail_or_yahoo` to hold the result. The `COUNT()` function is used to count the number of records that meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`ENDSWITH(email, '@gmail.com') | ENDSWITH(email, '@yahoo.com')`**: This is the filter condition.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, '@gmail.com')` checks if the `email` field ends with the string '@gmail.com'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, '@yahoo.com')` checks if the `email` field ends with the string '@yahoo.com'.
    *   The `|` operator represents a logical OR, so the condition is true if the email ends with *either* '@gmail.com' *or* '@yahoo.com'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph because we need a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_patients = COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_patients` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function, which will count the number of records in the collection provided to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE` to select only the patients who meet the specified criteria.
4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition for each patient.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the patient has at least one record in the sub-collection specified inside `HAS`.

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary time boundaries using the `DermTreatment` graph context.
    *   `current_month_start`: Determines the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_period`: Calculates the date 12 months prior to the `current_month_start` using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-12 months')`. This defines the beginning of our 12-month window.

2.  **`filtered_treatments = time_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection based on the calculated time boundaries.
    *   `WHERE((start_dt >= start_period) & (start_dt < current_month_start))`: Selects treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the last 12 full months (from `start_period` up to, but not including, `current_month_start`).

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this step prepares the data for grouping:
    *   `treatment_month = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(start_dt), LPAD(MONTH(start_dt), 2, ""0""))`: Creates a string representation of the month (e.g., ""2023-11"") by combining the year and zero-padded month from the `start_dt`. This will be used as the partitioning key.
    *   `patient_id = patient_id`: Explicitly includes the `patient_id` so it can be used for distinct counting (`NDISTINCT`) after partitioning.

4.  **`monthly_stats = filtered_treatments.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the `filtered_treatments` data.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (optional but good practice).
    *   `by=treatment_month`: Groups the treatments based on the `treatment_month` calculated previously.

5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step performs the final calculations for each monthly group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `treatment_month = treatment_month`: Includes the month identifier in the final output.
    *   `PMPD = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Calculates the ""Per Month Patient Diagnoses"" by counting the number of unique `patient_id`s within each `treatment_month` group.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to compute a new value based on the selected drug(s).
3.  **`average_weight_kg=AVG(treatments_used_in.patient.weight_kg)`**:
    *   `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments where the selected drug ('Drugalin') was used.
    *   `.patient`: For each of those treatments, it accesses the corresponding patient record.
    *   `.weight_kg`: It retrieves the `weight_kg` field from each of these patient records.
    *   `AVG(...)`: This aggregation function calculates the average of all the retrieved `weight_kg` values.
    *   `average_weight_kg=...`: The calculated average weight is assigned to the field `average_weight_kg` in the result.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need a single aggregated value (the average weight) across a subset of the entire patient population. `CALCULATE` on the top-level collection is used to compute global or cohort-level aggregates.
2.  **`caw_male_patients=AVG(...)`**: We define the output field `caw_male_patients` (Cohort Average Weight for male patients) and assign it the result of the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(gender == 'Male')`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we first access the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only patients whose `gender` is 'Male'.
4.  **`.weight_kg`**: We then specify the field `weight_kg` from the filtered male patients. The `AVG` function calculates the average of this field for the selected cohort.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`first_treatments`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection. Using `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Patients"") == 1`, we identify the earliest treatment (`start_dt`) for each unique patient (`per=""Patients""`). We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `YEAR` from the `start_dt` of these first treatments, naming it `first_treatment_year`.
2.  **`new_patients_per_year`**: We take the `first_treatments` results and `PARTITION` them by the `first_treatment_year`. This groups all the first treatments that occurred in the same year. Inside the `CALCULATE` for this partition, we select the `year` (which is the `first_treatment_year` partition key) and calculate `num_new_patients` by using `COUNT(Treatments)`. Since we are operating on the partitioned collection of *first treatments*, this count effectively gives us the number of patients whose *first* treatment occurred in that specific year (i.e., the number of new patients for that year).
3.  **`result`**: We take the `new_patients_per_year` results and first `ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` to ensure the years are sequential. Then, in the final `CALCULATE`, we select the `year` and `num_new_patients`. We calculate the `npi` (New Patient Increase) by subtracting the previous year's `num_new_patients` from the current year's count. The `PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)` function retrieves the `num_new_patients` value from the previous row (ordered by year). We provide `default=0` so that for the earliest year in the dataset (which has no preceding year), the NPI calculation effectively becomes `num_new_patients - 0`.","# Step 1: Identify the first treatment for each patient using RANKING

**Explanation:**

1.  **`valid_outcomes_for_pasi = Outcomes.WHERE(...)`**: This line defines a reusable expression `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`. It starts with the `Outcomes` collection and filters it using `WHERE` to include only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The condition `(field == field)` is used as a proxy for checking non-null values, assuming nulls do not equal themselves.
2.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the `DermTreatment` graph.
3.  **`avg_d7 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`**: Inside the first `CALCULATE`, this calculates the average `day7_pasi_score` using only the records defined in `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
4.  **`avg_d100 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`**: Similarly, this calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` using the same filtered set of records.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is chained to compute the final result based on the previously calculated averages.
6.  **`d7d100pir = IFF(...)`**: This line calculates the D7D100PIR percentage according to the provided formula: `(avg_d100 - avg_d7) / avg_d7 * 100.0`.
7.  **`IFF(avg_d7 != 0, ..., None)`**: The `IFF` function handles the case where the average day 7 PASI score (`avg_d7`) might be zero, which would cause a division-by-zero error. If `avg_d7` is not zero, the formula is calculated; otherwise, `None` (representing null) is returned.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection because we want to aggregate results per drug.
2.  **`drug_id=drug_id, drug_name=drug_name`**: We select the `drug_id` and `drug_name` to include them in the final output.
3.  **`num_same_month_events=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_same_month_events` to store the count of adverse events meeting the specific criteria for each drug.
4.  **`treatments_used_in.adverse_events`**: We navigate from each `Drug` to its associated `Treatments` (`treatments_used_in`) and then to the `AdverseEvents` reported during those treatments.
5.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: We filter these `AdverseEvents`.
6.  **`(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`**: This is the core filtering condition. It checks if the year of the adverse event's `reported_dt` matches the year of the corresponding treatment's `start_dt`, AND if the month of the `reported_dt` matches the month of the `start_dt`. This ensures we only count events reported in the same calendar month and year as the treatment began. Note that `treatment.start_dt` accesses the `start_dt` from the parent `Treatment` record associated with the current `AdverseEvent`.
7.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of adverse events that passed the `WHERE` filter for the current drug.
8.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=num_same_month_events.DESC())`**: After calculating the `num_same_month_events` for all drugs, we use `TOP_K` to select only the single drug (`k=1`) that has the highest count (`by=num_same_month_events.DESC()`).

This query efficiently calculates the required count for each drug and then selects the one with the maximum count, returning its ID, name, and the count itself.","top_drug_by_same_month_events = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatment_info = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection. It filters these treatments based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`: Selects treatments where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022.
    *   `HAS(outcome_records.day100_pasi_score) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment has an associated outcome record where the `day100_pasi_score` is present (not null).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered treatments, this calculates intermediate values needed for the final aggregation:
    *   `p_id=patient.patient_id`: Retrieves the unique ID of the patient associated with the treatment.
    *   `insurance_type=patient.ins_type`: Retrieves the insurance type of the patient.
    *   `pasi_100=outcome_records.SINGULAR().day100_pasi_score`: Accesses the `day100_pasi_score` from the associated outcome record. `SINGULAR()` is used assuming there's only one relevant outcome record per treatment for the day 100 assessment.
3.  **`grouped_by_insurance = treatment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `treatment_info` collection into groups based on the `insurance_type`. Each group (`ins_groups`) contains all treatment records sharing the same insurance type.
4.  **`insurance_stats = grouped_by_insurance.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs calculations on each partition group created in the previous step:
    *   `ins_type=insurance_type`: Includes the insurance type (the partition key) in the result.
    *   `avg_pasi_100=AVG(treatment_info.pasi_100)`: Calculates the average `pasi_100` score for all treatments within that specific insurance type group. It refers back to the `pasi_100` field calculated in the `treatment_info` collection.
    *   `distinct_patient_count=NDISTINCT(treatment_info.p_id)`: Counts the number of unique patient IDs (`p_id`) within that insurance type group, effectively giving the distinct patient count per insurance type.
5.  **`top_insurance_types = insurance_stats.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_100.ASC())`**: This takes the results grouped by insurance type (`insurance_stats`) and selects the top 5 records based on the `avg_pasi_100` field, sorted in ascending order (`ASC()`), meaning the lowest average scores come first.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: We filter this collection using the `WHERE` clause.

We keep only the doctors for whom this condition is true (`== 1`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the requested fields for the filtered doctors:
    *   `doctor_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's unique ID.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Diagnoses` collection and filter it to include only those diagnoses that have at least one associated treatment (`treatments_for`) which in turn has at least one outcome record (`outcome_records`) containing a non-null `day100_itch_vas` score. This ensures we only consider diagnoses with relevant data for the ranking.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each qualifying diagnosis, we calculate three fields:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Renames the `diag_name` field for the output.
    *   `num_patients=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the treatments (`treatments_for`) for the current diagnosis by accessing the `patient` linked to each treatment and counting distinct `patient_id`s.
    *   `max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Finds the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records (`outcome_records`) linked to the treatments (`treatments_for`) for the current diagnosis.
3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))`**: Finally, we select the top 3 diagnoses from the calculated results based on the `max_itch_score`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_calc = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the `start_period_date`. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` determines the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. This defines the beginning of our time window.
2.  **`.Treatments.WHERE(start_dt >= start_period_date)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter it to include only those records where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `start_period_date`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_specialty=doctor.speciality)`**: For the filtered treatments, we calculate a new field `doc_specialty` by accessing the `speciality` of the linked `doctor`. This field is needed for partitioning. The original `tot_drug_amt` field remains accessible.
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty))`**: We partition the resulting collection based on the `doc_specialty`. This groups all treatments prescribed by doctors of the same specialty together.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each specialty group created by the partition:
    *   `specialty=doc_specialty`: We select the specialty name.
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments)`: We count the number of treatments within that specific specialty group.
    *   `total_drug_amount=SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: We sum the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within that specific specialty group.
6.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())`**: We select the top 3 resulting specialty groups, ordered in descending order based on the calculated `total_drug_amount`.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 drugs based on the number of treatments they were used in. For these top 5 drugs, also calculate the average amount of the drug used per treatment.
2.  **Collections:** We need `Drugs` (for drug names) and `Treatments` (for treatment count and drug amount).
3.  **Relationship:** `Drugs` has a one-to-many relationship with `Treatments` via the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
4.  **Calculations:**
    *   Count the number of treatments for each drug (`COUNT(treatments_used_in)`).
    *   Calculate the average `tot_drug_amt` for each drug (`AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`).
5.  **Selection:** Select the top 5 drugs based on the treatment count.
6.  **Output:** Return `drug_name`, `num_treatments`, and `avg_drug_amount`.

**PyDough Code Generation:**

```python

).TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Drugs` collection and filters it to include only those drugs that have at least one associated treatment record in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each remaining drug, it calculates three fields:
    *   `drug_name = drug_name`: Selects the original drug name.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `avg_drug_amount = AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`: Calculates the average of the `tot_drug_amt` field from all associated treatments for the current drug.
3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())`**: Takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 records, ordered by the `num_treatments` field in descending order (highest count first).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`six_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`**: This line defines a contextless expression to calculate the date exactly 6 months prior to the current date and time (`'now'`). This makes the subsequent filtering logic cleaner.
2.  **`filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This starts with the `Treatments` collection and applies filters using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition filters treatments linked to a diagnosis whose name contains ""psoriasis"". `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `%` acts as a wildcard for characters before and after ""psoriasis"".
4.  **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This condition checks if the drug associated with the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS` function returns true if the field exists and is not null, indicating the drug is FDA-approved.
5.  **`(end_dt > six_months_ago) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This compound condition filters treatments based on their end date (`end_dt`). It ensures the treatment ended *after* the date calculated as 6 months ago *and* on or before the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`), effectively selecting treatments that ended within the last 6 months.
6.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(count_of_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`**: Finally, this calculates the total count of treatments that passed all the filters defined in `filtered_treatments`. The `COUNT` function aggregates the number of records in the filtered collection, and the result is assigned to the `count_of_treatments` field within a top-level `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` context, providing a single output value as requested.","# CALCULATE the date 6 months ago from today

2.  **`qualifying_meds = placebo_treatments.concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each `placebo_treatment`. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these concomitant medications.
3.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`**: This is the core filtering condition within the `WHERE` clause.

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the average age (in integer years) of male patients with private insurance.
2.  **Collection:** We need patient information, so we'll start with the `Patients` collection within the `DermTreatment` graph.
3.  **Filtering:** We need to filter patients based on two criteria:
    *   `gender` must be 'Male'.
    *   `ins_type` must be 'Private'.
4.  **Calculation:** For each filtered patient, we need to calculate their age in years. Age is the difference between the current date and their `date_of_birth`. We can use `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`.
5.  **Aggregation:** We need the *average* of these calculated ages. The `AVG()` function is appropriate here.
6.  **Final Format:** The result should be an integer. We can use `ROUND(..., 0)` to round the average age to the nearest whole number.

```python
# Filter patients to include only males with private insurance
filtered_patients = Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private'))

# Calculate the age for each filtered patient

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_patients = Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private'))`: This line starts with the `Patients` collection and filters it to keep only records where the `gender` is 'Male' AND the `ins_type` is 'Private'.
2.  `patients_with_age = filtered_patients.CALCULATE(...)`: This takes the `filtered_patients` and calculates a new field `current_age` for each patient. The age is determined by finding the difference in full years between their `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) using the `DATEDIFF` function.
3.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs the final aggregation at the top `DermTreatment` graph level. It calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `current_age` field from the `patients_with_age` collection. The `ROUND(..., 0)` function then rounds this average value to the nearest integer (0 decimal places), storing it in the `average_male_private_insurance_age` field.","# Filter patients to include only males with private insurance

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it to include only those merchants who have received at least one transaction marked as 'Completed'. This is done using `HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'Completed')) == 1`. This pre-filtering step ensures we only process relevant merchants and avoids potential division-by-zero issues later.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: For each filtered merchant, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Select the merchant's name.
    *   `distinct_successful_tx=COUNT(...)`: We count the number of transactions received by the merchant where the `status` is 'Completed'. This gives us the denominator for the CPUR calculation.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(...)`: We count the number of *distinct* `coupon_id`s associated with the successful transactions received by the merchant. This gives us the numerator for the CPUR calculation. We filter `transactions_received` again for `status == 'Completed'` and then access the `coupon_id` for the distinct count.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: We perform a final calculation on the results from the previous step:

).ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:** We first calculate the start and end dates for our analysis period using `Ewallet.CALCULATE` and the `DATETIME` function. `start_date` is set to 3 weeks before the start of the current week, and `end_date` is set to the start of the current week, effectively excluding the current week.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Notifications:** We access the `Notifications` collection via the `date_boundaries` context. We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter notifications based on two criteria:
    *   The `created_at` timestamp falls within our defined `start_date` and `end_date`.
    *   The associated `user`'s `country` is either 'US' or 'CA' using `ISIN`.
    *   Within a `CALCULATE` step, we derive two new fields for each filtered notification:
        *   `notification_week_start`: Uses `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')` to find the starting date of the week the notification belongs to.
        *   `is_weekend`: Uses `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` to check if the notification was sent on a weekend, resulting in `True` or `False`.
3.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` on the `filtered_notifications` collection, grouping them by the `notification_week_start` field. This creates groups, where each group contains all relevant notifications sent within the same week.
4.  **Calculate Weekly Counts:** We apply a `CALCULATE` operation on the `weekly_groups`. For each group (week):
    *   We select the `notification_week_start` as `week_start_date`.
    *   `total_notifications_in_week` is calculated using `COUNT(Notifications)` to count all notifications within that week's partition group.
    *   `weekend_notifications_in_week` is calculated using `SUM(Notifications.is_weekend)`. Since `is_weekend` is `True` (1) for weekend notifications and `False` (0) otherwise, summing this field effectively counts only the weekend notifications within the group.
5.  **Final Selection and Ordering:** A final `CALCULATE` selects the three required fields (`week_start_date`, `total_notifications_in_week`, `weekend_notifications_in_week`). The `ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())` clause ensures the results are sorted chronologically by week.","# Define the date boundaries for the last 3 weeks (excluding the current week)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`(status == 'Active')`**: This condition filters for merchants whose status is exactly 'Active'.
3.  **`(LOWER(category) == 'retail')`**: This condition filters for merchants whose category is 'Retail'. `LOWER()` is used to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, matching 'Retail', 'retail', 'RETAIL', etc.
4.  **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition ensures that we only include merchants who have issued at least one coupon by checking if the `coupons` sub-collection is not empty.
5.  **`&`**: The ampersand operator combines these three conditions, meaning a merchant must satisfy *all* of them to be included.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select and compute the desired output fields.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`us_transactions_last_7_days = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on three conditions combined with the logical AND operator (`&`):
    *   `sender_type == 1`: Ensures that the transaction was initiated by a `User` (as opposed to a `Merchant`, which might be type 2, based on the schema description).
    *   `sending_user.country == 'US'`: Accesses the `sending_user` relationship (linking to the `Users` collection) and checks if the user's `country` field is 'US'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) < 7`: Calculates the difference in days between the transaction's creation timestamp (`created_at`) and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). It keeps only transactions where this difference is less than 7, effectively selecting transactions from the last 7 days, including today.

2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs the final aggregation at the top `Ewallet` graph level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days, inclusive. It uses `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` to compare the update date with the current date.
2.  **`user_average_balances = recent_user_balances.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered balances by `user_id`. For each unique user (`user_id`) present in the filtered data, it creates a group.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_amb = AVG(UserBalances.balance))`**: Within each user partition created in the previous step, this calculates the average `balance` for that specific user's records from the `recent_user_balances`. This result is named `user_amb`, representing the Average Balance for that user over the specified period.
4.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step takes the collection of per-user average balances (`user_average_balances`) and calculates the overall average of the `user_amb` values across all users.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_balance_record = Users.balances.WHERE(...)`**: We start by defining a reusable expression `latest_balance_record`. It operates on the `balances` sub-collection accessible from each `User`.
2.  **`RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: This ranks the balance records based on their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order, meaning the most recent date gets rank 1.
    *   `per=""Users""`: This crucial part ensures the ranking is performed independently *for each user*. It partitions the ranking calculation based on the parent `Users` collection.
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the balance record with rank 1 (the latest one for that specific user).

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive the desired output fields for each user.

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the Merchant Revenue Rank (MRR) for each merchant.
2.  **Definition of MRR:** Rank merchants based on the total amount of *successfully received* transactions. Rank 1 is the highest revenue.
3.  **Data Source:** `Transactions` collection.
4.  **Filtering:**
    *   Transactions must be *received* by a merchant. The schema indicates `Transactions.receiving_merchant` links to `Merchants`, and `Transactions.receiver_type == 2` signifies a merchant receiver. We should use the relationship `Merchants.transactions_received`.
    *   Transactions must be *successful*. We'll assume `status == 'Completed'` indicates success.
5.  **Calculation:**
    *   For each merchant, `SUM` the `amount` of their successful received transactions.
    *   Rank these summed amounts using `RANKING`.
6.  **Output:** Merchant `name`, `category`, the calculated `revenue_amount`, and the `revenue_rank`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. We apply a `WHERE` clause with `HAS` to filter only those merchants who have received at least one transaction with the status 'Completed'. This avoids potential errors or null sums for merchants with no relevant transactions.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, merchant_category=category, total_revenue=SUM(...))`**: For the filtered merchants, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name`: Renaming `name` for clarity.
    *   `merchant_category`: Renaming `category`.
    *   `total_revenue`: We use the `SUM` aggregation function on the `transactions_received` sub-collection. Inside the `SUM`, we filter these transactions again to include only those where `status == 'Completed'` and sum their `amount`.
3.  **`ranked_merchant_revenue = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: We take the `merchant_revenues` collection (which now has name, category, and total revenue for each relevant merchant) and apply another `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: Inside this `CALCULATE`, we compute the `revenue_rank` using the `RANKING` window function. We rank `by` the `total_revenue` calculated in the previous step, using `.DESC()` so that the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.
5.  **`result = ranked_merchant_revenue.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select the final required fields: `merchant_name`, `merchant_category`, `revenue_amount` (renaming `total_revenue`), and `revenue_rank`.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(revenue_rank.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the results by the calculated rank in ascending order, so the top-ranked merchant appears first.","# CALCULATE the total revenue for each merchant from completed transactions they received.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:** We first establish the time window using `DATETIME('now', ...)` to get the start date of two months ago and the start date of the current month. This ensures we only consider the two full calendar months preceding the current one.
2.  **Filter Transactions:** We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those records where:
    *   `sender_type == 1` (identifying transactions sent by Users, based on the schema description). *Note: The prompt definition mentioned `sender_type = 0`, but the schema indicates `1` for Users. I've used `1` based on the schema.*
    *   The transaction `created_at` timestamp falls within the calculated date range (greater than or equal to the start of two months ago AND less than the start of the current month).
3.  **Extract Date Components:** From the filtered transactions, we extract the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` of the `created_at` timestamp, along with the `sender_id`.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU):** We use `PARTITION` to group the transactions by `tx_year`, `tx_month`, and `tx_day`. Within each daily partition (`days`), we calculate `dau_count` using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)` to count the unique users who made transactions on that specific day.
5.  **Group DAU by Month:** We then take the results (`daily_active_users`) which contain DAU counts for each day, and `PARTITION` them again, this time by `tx_year` and `tx_month`. This groups all the daily DAU counts for a given month together.
6.  **Calculate PMDAU:** Within each monthly partition (`months`), we calculate the final result:
    *   `year_month`: We format the year and month into a 'YYYY-MM' string using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent formatting.
    *   `pmdau`: We calculate the average (`AVG`) of the `dau_count` from the `daily_active_users` collection (which represents the daily counts within that month). This gives the Per Month Daily Active Users.
7.  **Order Results:** Finally, we sort the results by `year_month` in ascending order using `ORDER_BY`.","# Define date boundaries: start of 2 months ago and start of the current MONTH

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and filter it to include only users who have at least one session (`HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`) that started on or after `2023-06-01` and before `2023-06-08`. This pre-filters users, ensuring we only process those relevant to the query.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered user, we calculate the required fields:
    *   `user_id=uid`: Selects the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and names it `user_id`.
    *   `total_duration_seconds=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of session durations.
3.  **`SUM(sessions.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...).duration_secs)`**: This part calculates the total duration:
    *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: Accesses the `sessions` sub-collection for the current user and filters them again based on the `session_start_ts` falling within the specified range (`>= ""2023-06-01""` and `< ""2023-06-08""`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(duration_secs=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, it calculates the duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF` between the `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. This result is temporarily named `duration_secs`.
    *   `.duration_secs`: Accesses the calculated `duration_secs` for the `SUM` function.
    *   `SUM(...)`: Aggregates (sums up) the `duration_secs` of all relevant sessions for the user. The result should be an integer representing the total seconds.

"What is the TUC in the past month, inclusive of 1 month ago? Return the total count.TUC = Total number of user sessions in the past month","SELECT COUNT(*) AS TUC FROM user_sessions WHERE session_start_ts >= DATE('now', '-1 month') OR session_end_ts >= DATE('now', '-1 month');",Ewallet,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the ""Total number of user sessions (TUC)"" within the last month.
2.  **Definition:** TUC is explicitly defined as the count of records in the `UserSessions` collection.
3.  **Timeframe:** ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"". This means we need sessions where the `session_start_ts` falls between exactly one month prior to the current moment and the current moment.
4.  **Data Source:** The `UserSessions` collection in the `Ewallet` database contains session start times (`session_start_ts`).
5.  **Output:** A single value representing the total count.

**PyDough Implementation:**

1.  We need to filter the `UserSessions` collection based on the `session_start_ts`.
2.  The start date for the filter is `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
3.  The end date for the filter is `DATETIME('now')`.
4.  We need sessions where `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to the start date AND less than or equal to the end date.
5.  We will use `COUNT` on the filtered collection.
6.  Since we need a single total count, we'll perform the calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level using `CALCULATE`.

```python
# Define the start and end timestamps for the past month
one_month_ago = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')
now_ts = DATETIME('now')

# Filter UserSessions that started within the last month (inclusive)
sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(
    (session_start_ts >= one_month_ago) & (session_start_ts <= now_ts)
)

# Calculate the total count of these sessions at the Ewallet graph level
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    tuc_past_month = COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This contextless expression defines the timestamp exactly one month before the current time.
2.  `now_ts = DATETIME('now')`: This contextless expression defines the current timestamp.
3.  `sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `UserSessions` collection. The `WHERE` clause selects sessions where the `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to (`>=`) `one_month_ago` AND less than or equal to (`<=`) `now_ts`.
4.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs the final calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level.
5.  `tuc_past_month = COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)`: Inside the `CALCULATE`, it counts the number of records in the previously filtered `sessions_in_past_month` collection and assigns the result to the field `tuc_past_month`.","# Define the start and end timestamps for the past MONTH

    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to determine two key date boundaries:
    *   `start_of_current_month`: Uses `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to find the first moment of the current month.
    *   `start_of_prev_month`: Uses `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')` to find the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current one.

2.  **`transaction_counts = date_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: Building on the previous step, we calculate the necessary transaction counts:
    *   `total_transactions_prev_month`: We access the `Transactions` collection and filter using `WHERE` to include only transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to `start_of_prev_month` AND less than `start_of_current_month`). We then use `COUNT` to get the total number of such transactions.
    *   `successful_transactions_prev_month`: We apply the same date filter to `Transactions` but add an additional condition `status == 'Completed'` to count only the successful transactions within that period.

3.  **`result = transaction_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR) based on the counts obtained:
    *   `previous_month_str`: We use the `IFF` function to handle the case where there might be zero total transactions (to avoid division by zero).
        *   If `total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than 0, it calculates `100.0 * successful_transactions_prev_month / total_transactions_prev_month` to get the percentage STR. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point division and get a percentage value.
        *   If `total_transactions_prev_month` is 0, it returns `0.0`.
    *   This final `CALCULATE` ensures that only the `previous_month_str` is included in the `result`.","# CALCULATE the start of the current MONTH and the start of the previous MONTH

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_coupon_counts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to compute new fields for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_id=mid, merchant_name=name`**: We select the merchant's ID (`mid`) and `name`.
3.  **`merchant_creation_month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(...)`**: We create a string representing the year and month the merchant was created (e.g., ""2023-05"").
    *   `YEAR(created_at)` extracts the year from the merchant's creation timestamp.
    *   `MONTH(created_at)` extracts the month number.
    *   `LPAD(..., 2, ""0"")` ensures the month is zero-padded (e.g., 5 becomes ""05"").
    *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ...)` combines the year and padded month with a hyphen.
4.  **`same_month_coupon_count=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate the number of coupons created in the same month/year as the merchant.
    *   `coupons` accesses the list of coupons associated with the current merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(...)` filters these coupons.
    *   Inside the `WHERE`, we construct the same ""YYYY-MM"" string for the *coupon's* `created_at` timestamp.
    *   `== merchant_creation_month_year` compares the coupon's creation month/year string with the merchant's creation month/year string calculated earlier in the same `CALCULATE`.
    *   `COUNT(...)` counts how many coupons passed the filter for the current merchant.
5.  **`top_merchant = merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=same_month_coupon_count.DESC())`**: We take the results from the previous step (`merchant_coupon_counts`) and use `TOP_K` to find the single (`1`) merchant who has the highest (`DESC()`) value for `same_month_coupon_count`.
6.  **`result = top_merchant.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select only the required output fields from the top merchant found: `merchant_id`, `merchant_name`, and the count, renaming `same_month_coupon_count` to `num_coupons` for clarity.","# CALCULATE the count of coupons created in the same MONTH and year as the merchant

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and apply filters.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters for users whose `country` field, when converted to lowercase, is exactly 'us'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the country.
3.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is a crucial filter.
    *   `notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'Promotion') & (status == 'Sent'))`: This inner part selects only the notifications for the current user that are of type 'Promotion' *and* have a status of 'Sent' (assuming 'Sent' means unread, as opposed to 'Read').
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This checks if the user has at least one notification matching the inner criteria. This ensures we only consider users who actually *have* unread promotional notifications.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who passed the `WHERE` filter, we calculate the desired output fields.
5.  **`user_name=username`**: We select the user's `username` and assign it to the output field `user_name`.

    *   `COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'Promotion') & (status == 'Sent')))`: This counts, for each selected user, how many of their notifications meet the criteria (type 'Promotion' and status 'Sent'). This count is assigned to the output field `total_unread_promotional_notifications`.

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = monthly_active_users
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions (`tx_data`):**
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `WHERE` filters these transactions based on several criteria:
        *   `sender_type == 1`: Ensures the sender is a `User` (not a `Merchant`).
        *   `sending_user.status == 'Active'`: Checks the status of the linked sending user to ensure they are 'Active'.
        *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Filters for transactions created in the year 2023.
        *   `status == 'Completed'`: Includes only successful transactions.
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes the filtered transactions:
        *   `month_year = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(created_at), LPAD(MONTH(created_at), 2, ""0""))`: Creates a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., ""2023-01""). `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., '01' instead of '1'). This string will be used for grouping.
        *   `sender_uid = sending_user.uid`: Extracts the unique ID (`uid`) of the sending user. This is needed to count distinct users later.

2.  **Partition by Month (`monthly_partitions`):**
    *   We take the `tx_data` (which now includes the `month_year` and `sender_uid`).
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_tx"", by=month_year)` groups these records based on the `month_year` string. All transactions from the same month fall into the same group. The `name=""monthly_tx""` gives a name to the sub-collection within each partition group, representing the transactions belonging to that specific month.

3.  **Calculate Distinct Users per Month (`monthly_active_users`):**
    *   We operate on the `monthly_partitions`.
    *   `CALCULATE` derives the final output fields for each month group:
        *   `month_date=month_year`: Selects the month identifier (e.g., ""2023-01"").
        *   `num_distinct_active_users=NDISTINCT(monthly_tx.sender_uid)`: This is the core calculation. For each month group, it looks at the `monthly_tx` sub-collection (containing all relevant transactions for that month) and counts the number of *distinct* `sender_uid` values using `NDISTINCT`. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically based on the `month_date`.

4.  **Assign Result (`result`):**
    *   The final calculated and ordered data is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Filter transactions to include only those sent by active users in 2023 and were completed successfully.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Get a unique list of merchant IDs (`mid`) that have appeared as the *receiver* in any transaction.
2.  **Relevant Collections:** `Merchants` and `Transactions`.
3.  **Key Fields:**
    *   `Merchants.mid`: The ID we want to return.
    *   `Merchants.transactions_received`: The link from a merchant to the transactions they received.
    *   `Transactions.receiver_id`: The ID of the transaction receiver.
    *   `Transactions.receiver_type`: Indicates if the receiver is a User (1) or Merchant (2).
4.  **Logic:** We need to find merchants who have at least one entry in their `transactions_received` list. Then, we just need to extract their `mid`. Using `HAS` on the `transactions_received` sub-collection is the most direct way to achieve this.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Find merchants that have received at least one transaction
receiving_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1)

# Select only the distinct merchant IDs
distinct_merchant_ids = receiving_merchants.CALCULATE(
    merchant_id=mid
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `receiving_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters it. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HAS(transactions_received) == 1` condition, which checks if the `transactions_received` sub-collection (linking a merchant to the transactions they received) contains at least one record. This effectively selects only those merchants who have received one or more transactions.
2.  `distinct_merchant_ids = receiving_merchants.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`: This line takes the filtered `receiving_merchants` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to select only the `mid` field, renaming it to `merchant_id` in the output. Since we started with the `Merchants` collection (where each record represents a unique merchant), the resulting list of `merchant_id` values will inherently be distinct.","# Find merchants that have received at least one transaction

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection.
2.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'Transaction')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `notifications`: Accesses the list of notifications associated with each user.

    *   `HAS(...)`: Checks if the filtered list of transaction notifications is *not* empty (i.e., the user has at least one). The `== 1` signifies that we want users where this condition is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_id=uid)`**: After filtering, we select the `uid` field from the resulting `Users` collection and rename it to `user_id` for the final output.

1.  **Analyze the Request:** We need to find users who have *no* associated records in their `notifications` sub-collection. The output should include the user's `uid` and `username`.

1.  **`Coupons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Coupons` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used here to compute aggregated statistics for each coupon.
2.  **`coupon_code=code`**: Selects the coupon code and renames it to `coupon_code`.
3.  **`total_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in)`**: Counts the number of transactions associated with each coupon via the `transaction_used_in` relationship. This gives the total number of times each coupon was redeemed. The result is stored in the `total_redemptions` field.
4.  **`total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions where the coupon was used. This gives the total monetary value redeemed using each coupon. The result is stored in the `total_amount_redeemed` field.
5.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())`**: After calculating the statistics for all coupons, this function selects the top 3 coupons based on the `total_redemptions` field, sorting them in descending order (`DESC`) to get the most frequently used ones first.
6.  **`result = top_coupon_stats`**: The final result, containing the `coupon_code`, `total_redemptions`, and `total_amount_redeemed` for the top 3 most frequently used coupons, is assigned to the variable `result`.","# CALCULATE usage statistics for each coupon and select the top 3 by redemption count

**Explanation:**

1.  **`user_transactions_with_country = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 1).CALCULATE(sender_country = sending_user.country)`**: This line starts with the `Transactions` collection. It filters these transactions using `WHERE(sender_type == 1)` to select only those where the sender is a User (as per the schema description where `sender_type` is 1 for User). It then uses `CALCULATE` to determine the `country` of the `sending_user` for each of these transactions and assigns it to the temporary field `sender_country`.
2.  **`country_aggregates = user_transactions_with_country.PARTITION(...)`**: This line takes the filtered transactions (now associated with the sender's country) and partitions them using `PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(sender_country))`. This groups the transactions based on the `sender_country`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Following the `PARTITION`, this `CALCULATE` operates on each country group.
    *   `country = sender_country`: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: Calculates the number of unique sending users within each country group by counting the distinct `uid`s of the `sending_user` associated with the transactions in that group.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within each country group.
4.  **`top_5_countries = country_aggregates.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**: This line takes the results from the previous step (one record per country with aggregated data) and selects the top 5 records based on the `total_transaction_amount` field in descending order (`DESC()`).
5.  **`result = top_5_countries`**: The final result, containing the top 5 countries with their distinct user counts and total transaction amounts, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Step 1: Filter transactions to include only those sent by users (sender_type=1)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection because the final output is focused on merchants. We use `CALCULATE` to compute aggregated values for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_name=name`**: Selects the merchant's name.
3.  **`total_number_of_transactions=COUNT(...)`**: Calculates the count of transactions for each merchant.
    *   **`transactions_received`**: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant. This implicitly filters for transactions where the merchant is the receiver (`receiver_type == 2`).
    *   **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150)`**: Filters these transactions to include only those created within the last 150 days (inclusive). `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days.
    *   **`COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of transactions that meet the date criteria.
4.  **`total_transaction_amount=SUM(...)`**: Calculates the total amount received by each merchant from the filtered transactions.
    *   It accesses the same filtered list of `transactions_received` as the `COUNT` operation.
    *   **`.amount`**: Accesses the `amount` field of each filtered transaction.
    *   **`SUM(...)`**: Sums up the `amount` for all filtered transactions for the merchant.
5.  **`.WHERE(total_number_of_transactions > 0)`**: This step filters out merchants who had zero transactions in the specified period, ensuring they don't interfere with the `TOP_K` ranking (e.g., if `SUM` resulted in null or zero).
6.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**: Selects the top 2 merchants based on the calculated `total_transaction_amount`, ordered in descending order (highest amount first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`active_retail_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Merchants` collection. It then filters these merchants using `WHERE` to keep only those that satisfy two conditions joined by `&` (AND):
    *   `status == 'Active'`: The merchant's account status must be 'Active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(category), 'retail')`: The merchant's `category` field, converted to lowercase using `LOWER()` for case-insensitivity, must contain the substring 'retail'.
2.  **`todays_balances = active_retail_merchants.balances.WHERE(...)`**: This line takes the previously filtered `active_retail_merchants` and accesses their associated balance records via the `.balances` sub-collection. It then filters these balance records using `WHERE`:
    *   `DATETIME(updated_at, 'start of day') == DATETIME('now', 'start of day')`: This condition compares the date part of the `updated_at` timestamp with today's date. `DATETIME(..., 'start of day')` truncates a timestamp to the beginning of its day (midnight), ensuring we match balances recorded anytime today against the current date. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` gets today's date at midnight.
3.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs the final calculation at the top level of the `Ewallet` graph because we want a single aggregate value.
    *   `median_todays_balance = MEDIAN(todays_balances.balance)`: It calculates the median value of the `balance` field for all the records contained within the `todays_balances` collection (which represents the balances recorded today for active retail merchants). The result is assigned to the field `median_todays_balance`.","# Filter merchants to find those who are active and have 'retail' in their category (case-insensitive)

What was the average transaction daily and monthly limit for the earliest setting snapshot in 2023?,"SELECT AVG(tx_limit_daily) AS avg_daily_limit, AVG(tx_limit_monthly) AS avg_monthly_limit FROM user_setting_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date = (SELECT MIN(snapshot_date) FROM user_setting_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date >= '2023-01-01' AND snapshot_date < '2024-01-01');",Ewallet,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**1. Analyze the Request:**

*   We need data from the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection.
*   We need to filter these snapshots to only include those from the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`).
*   From the 2023 snapshots, we need to identify the ones taken on the *earliest* date.
*   For those specific earliest snapshots (there might be multiple on the same earliest date), we need to calculate the *average* `tx_limit_daily` and the *average* `tx_limit_monthly`.

**2. Plan the PyDough Code:**

*   Start with the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection.
*   Filter for the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`.
*   Use the `RANKING` window function to identify the snapshots with the earliest date. We'll rank by `snapshot_date` ascending (`ASC`) and allow ties (`allow_ties=True`) in case multiple snapshots were taken on the same earliest day. The earliest snapshots will have rank 1.
*   Filter the results to keep only those with rank 1 using `WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)`.
*   Finally, calculate the average `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` across this filtered set of earliest snapshots. Since we need a single result (the averages), we'll perform this calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level.

**3. Generate the PyDough Code:**

```python
# Filter UserSettingSnapshots for the year 2023 and identify those taken on the earliest date
earliest_snapshots_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(
    (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) &
    # Rank snapshots within 2023 by date ascending, allowing ties for the same date

# Calculate the average daily and monthly limits from these earliest snapshots

    avg_daily_limit=AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_daily),
    avg_monthly_limit=AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_monthly)
)
```

**4. Explanation:**

1.  `earliest_snapshots_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection.
2.  `(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This condition selects only the snapshots taken in the year 2023.
3.  `& (RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1)`: This part identifies the snapshots from the earliest date within 2023.
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)` assigns a rank to each 2023 snapshot based on its `snapshot_date`, starting from 1 for the earliest date(s). `allow_ties=True` ensures all snapshots on the very first date get rank 1.
    *   `== 1` filters to keep only those snapshots with rank 1 (i.e., the ones from the earliest date in 2023).
4.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We perform a final calculation at the top `Ewallet` level to get the overall averages from the filtered set.
5.  `avg_daily_limit=AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_daily)`: Calculates the average of the `tx_limit_daily` field across all the snapshots identified in the `earliest_snapshots_2023` collection.
6.  `avg_monthly_limit=AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_monthly)`: Calculates the average of the `tx_limit_monthly` field across the same set of earliest snapshots.

This code efficiently finds the snapshots from the earliest date in 2023 and then computes the required average limits from that specific set.","# Filter UserSettingSnapshots for the year 2023 and identify those taken on the earliest date

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = average_duration_by_device
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This first step processes the `UserSessions` collection. For each session, it calculates the duration in seconds by finding the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` using the `DATEDIFF` function. It keeps the `device_type` and stores the calculated duration in a new field called `session_duration_seconds`.
2.  **`partitioned_sessions = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...)`**: This step takes the results from the previous step (sessions with their calculated durations) and partitions them. It groups the sessions based on their `device_type` using the `PARTITION` function. Each group is named `sessions_by_device`.
3.  **`average_duration_by_device = partitioned_sessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each partition (i.e., for each unique `device_type`):
    *   It selects the `device_type` (which is the key for the partition).
    *   It calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `session_duration_seconds` for all sessions belonging to that specific `device_type` group. The `AVG(UserSessions.session_duration_seconds)` accesses the pre-calculated durations for the sessions within the current partition group.
4.  **`result = average_duration_by_device`**: The final result, containing each `device_type` and its corresponding average session duration in seconds, is assigned to the variable `result`.","# CALCULATE session duration for each session first
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(

2.  **`merchant_earliest_coupon_info = ...`**: This step iterates through the filtered merchants. For each merchant:

    *   It finds the *earliest* coupon for that merchant using `coupons.TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`. `TOP_K(1)` selects the single coupon with the minimum `start_date`.
    *   `.SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of `TOP_K(1, ...)` (which is technically a collection of one item) as a single record, allowing direct access to its fields (`cid`, `start_date`) in the next step. The result is stored in `earliest_coupon`.
3.  **`merchant_date_diff = ...`**: This step takes the intermediate result and:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
2.  **`HASNOT(...) == 1`**: This condition checks if a user does *not* have any associated records in the filtered sub-collection specified inside `HASNOT`. We are looking for users who have *no* notifications meeting the criteria.
3.  **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: Inside `HASNOT`, we access the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and apply another filter.
4.  **`(DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) < 365)`**: This is the core filtering condition for notifications.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at)` calculates the number of full days between the user's creation date (`Users.created_at` from the parent context) and the notification's creation date (`created_at` from the `notifications` context).
    *   We check if this difference is greater than or equal to 0 (notification happened on or after signup) AND less than 365 (within the first year).
5.  **`.CALCULATE(user_name=username, user_email=email, signup_date=created_at)`**: After filtering the users to include only those who did *not* receive a notification within their first year, we use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: `username`, `email`, and the user's `created_at` date (renamed to `signup_date`).","users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
