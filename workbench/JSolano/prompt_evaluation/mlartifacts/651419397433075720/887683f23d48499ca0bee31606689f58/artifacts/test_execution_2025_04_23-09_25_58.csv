**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first establish the time frame.
    *   `start_current_week`: Calculates the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_window`: Calculates the start date of the 8-week period we're interested in. We go to the start of the current week and subtract 8 weeks (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')`). This gives us the beginning of the first week in our 8-week window.

2.  **`payment_info = date_boundaries.Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Sales` collection for records where `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   `.payment`: We access the related `PaymentsReceived` records for these high-value sales.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_of_window) & (payment_date < start_current_week))`: We filter these payments to include only those that occurred within our target 8-week window (from `start_of_window` up to, but not including, `start_current_week`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each payment within the filtered set:
        *   `payment_week_start = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: We determine the start date of the week the payment occurred in. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend = ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (1, 7))`: We check if the payment date falls on a weekend. `DAYOFWEEK` returns a number representing the day (assuming 1 for Sunday, 7 for Saturday), and `ISIN` checks if it's one of those values. A boolean flag `is_weekend` is created.

3.  **`weekly_payments_summary = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We group the `payment_info` records.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=payment_week_start)`: This groups the payments based on the `payment_week_start` date calculated previously.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week = payment_week_start`: We select the week's start date.
        *   `total_payments_received = COUNT(payment_info)`: We count all payments belonging to that specific week's partition.
        *   `weekend_payments_received = SUM(IFF(is_weekend, 1, 0))`: We count only the weekend payments by summing 1 for each payment where the `is_weekend` flag is true within that week's partition.

4.  **`result = weekly_payments_summary.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the aggregated weekly results based on the `week` start date in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to process each salesperson.
2.  **`salesperson_id=_id, s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name`**: Inside `CALCULATE`, we select the salesperson's ID, first name, and last name, renaming them for clarity in the output.
3.  **`num_sales_last_30_days=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_sales_last_30_days` to store the count of recent sales for each salesperson.
4.  **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (the list of sales associated with the current salesperson) and apply a `WHERE` filter to it.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current time.
    *   `<= 29` ensures we only include sales that occurred today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago (29 days difference), effectively covering the last 30 days inclusive of today.
6.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of sales records that passed the `WHERE` filter for the current salesperson.
7.  **`.ORDER_BY(num_sales_last_30_days.DESC())`**: After calculating the fields for all salespersons, we sort the resulting collection in descending order based on the `num_sales_last_30_days` field, showing the most active salespersons first.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Cars` collection and applies filters:
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`: This condition filters for cars where the `vin_number`, after being converted to uppercase using `UPPER()`, contains the substring 'M5'. The `%` wildcards allow matching 'M5' anywhere within the VIN, and `UPPER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive as requested.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This condition ensures that only cars which have at least one associated sales record (i.e., have been sold at least once) are included in the subsequent steps.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only cars meeting both criteria are selected.

2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`**: This partitions the filtered cars into groups based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each partition (`model_group`) contains all the cars (that matched the VIN filter) of a specific make and model.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operation is performed on each partition (each make/model group):
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group (which is constant within the group as it's a partition key).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group (also a partition key).
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: This counts the total number of items in the `sale_records` sub-collection for *all* cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group within the partition. This gives the total sales count for that specific car model among the filtered cars.

4.  **`result = sales_per_model`**: The final result, containing the make, model, and the total number of sales for each model matching the criteria, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Filter cars whose VIN CONTAINS 'M5' (case-insensitive) and have associated sales records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_status = Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Cars` collection and calculates two important flags for each car:
    *   `has_sales`: Checks if the car has any associated records in the `sale_records` sub-collection using `HAS()`.
    *   `latest_inventory_status`: Determines the inventory status from the most recent snapshot. It accesses the `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection, ranks them by `snapshot_date` descending (`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"")`), filters for the top rank (`== 1`), selects that single record using `SINGULAR()`, and retrieves its `is_in_inventory` status. `DEFAULT_TO(..., True)` handles cases where a car might have no inventory snapshots, treating them as 'in inventory' by default for the purpose of filtering.

2.  **`filtered_cars = cars_with_status.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the cars based on the flags calculated previously. It keeps only cars where `has_sales` is `True` (the car was sold) AND `latest_inventory_status` is `False` (the car is not in inventory according to the latest snapshot).

3.  **`sales_info = filtered_cars.sale_records.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step accesses the `sale_records` for the `filtered_cars`. For each sale record, it calculates:
    *   `car_make`: Retrieves the `make` from the parent `car` record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it based on the specified criteria.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains the substring 'ford'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching. Using `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains the substring 'mustang', case-insensitively and partially.
4.  **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so cars matching either condition are included.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.
6.  **`car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year, car_color=color, car_vin=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields from the filtered `Cars` collection and assign them to new names in the result.
7.  **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which contains all sales for that car) and applies the `AVG` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field within those records.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Boundaries:** We first define the start and end dates for our analysis period. `current_month_start` gets the first day of the current month. `six_months_ago_start` calculates the date 6 months prior to `current_month_start`. The period of interest is `>= six_months_ago_start` and `< current_month_start`.
2.  **Filter Salespersons:** We select `Salespersons` whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023 using `WHERE` and `YEAR()`.
3.  **Access and Filter Sales:** We navigate from the filtered `selected_salespersons` to their `sales_made`. We then filter these `Sales` records using `WHERE` to keep only those with a `sale_date` within our defined 6-month period.
4.  **Calculate Month String:** In the same `CALCULATE` step, we create a `sale_month_str` field by formatting the `sale_date` into a 'YYYY-MM' string. This standardized format is crucial for correct grouping and sorting by month. We also explicitly include `sale_price` so it's available for the later aggregation.
5.  **Partition by Month:** We use `PARTITION` to group the `sales_in_period` records based on the `sale_month_str`. Each partition (`monthly_sales`) will contain all sales from a specific month within our timeframe made by the selected salespersons.
6.  **Calculate Metrics:** Within the `CALCULATE` clause following the `PARTITION`, we compute:
    *   `month`: We select the `sale_month_str` (the partition key).
    *   `PMSPS`: We use `COUNT(Sales)` to count the number of sales records within each month's partition.
    *   `PMSR`: We use `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` to sum the `sale_price` for all sales within each month's partition.
7.  **Order Results:** Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` to sort the resulting monthly metrics chronologically.
8.  **Assign to Result:** The final query is assigned to the `result` variable.

*Note:* This query will return results only for the months within the specified 6-month period where the selected salespersons actually made sales. Months with zero sales from this group will not be explicitly listed with 0 values, as the partitioning is based on existing sales data. Generating rows for months with no data typically requires different techniques (like joining with a calendar table), which might not be directly supported or straightforward in this PyDough context.","# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current MONTH

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_totals_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need an aggregate result across all relevant sales. We use `CALCULATE` to compute two aggregate values:
    *   **`total_revenue_2023`**: This calculates the sum of `sale_price` from the `Sales` collection, but only for sales records where the `YEAR` of the `sale_date` is 2023. `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters the sales first, and then `SUM(...)` aggregates the `sale_price` of those filtered sales.
    *   **`total_cost_2023`**: This calculates the sum of the `cost` of the cars involved in the 2023 sales. We again filter the `Sales` collection for the year 2023 using `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`. Then, for each filtered sale, we access the associated car's cost via `car.cost` and sum these costs using `SUM(...)`.

2.  **`result = sales_totals_2023.CALCULATE(...)`**: We take the result from the previous step (which contains `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`) and perform another `CALCULATE` to compute the final GPM.
    *   **`gpm_2023 = IFF(...)`**: This calculates the Gross Profit Margin using the formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
        *   `IFF(total_cost_2023 != 0, ... , None)`: This is a crucial step to prevent division by zero errors. It checks if `total_cost_2023` is not equal to zero.
        *   If `total_cost_2023` is not zero, it calculates `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`. We use `100.0` to ensure the result is a floating-point number representing the percentage.
        *   If `total_cost_2023` *is* zero, the `IFF` function returns `None` (which represents null in the database) to indicate that GPM cannot be calculated.","# CALCULATE total revenue and total cost for sales specifically in 2023

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it based on a condition related to inventory snapshots.
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if the car associated with the current sale (`car`) has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) inventory snapshot record (`inventory_snapshots`) that meets the inner `WHERE` conditions.
3.  **`(snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False)`**: This inner condition filters the inventory snapshots for the specific car. It looks for a snapshot where the `snapshot_date` exactly matches the `sale_date` of the sale record we are currently evaluating, *and* the `is_in_inventory` flag is `False` (meaning the car was recorded as out of inventory on that specific day).
4.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`**: After filtering the sales to include only those matching the inventory condition, this selects the single (`1`) sale record that has the highest `sale_price`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the maximum price.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step preprocesses the `PaymentsReceived` collection. It extracts the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` and keeps the `payment_amount` for later aggregation, renaming it to `pay_amount`.
2.  **`monthly_groups = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the preprocessed data (`payment_info`) into groups based on unique combinations of `pay_year` and `pay_month`. Each resulting group (named `""months""`) contains all payment records for a specific month.
3.  **`monthly_summary = monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the collection of monthly groups. For each group (i.e., each month):
    *   It selects the `year` and `month` (which are the partition keys).
    *   It calculates `total_received` by summing the `pay_amount` of all `PaymentsReceived` records belonging to that specific month's partition group.
    *   It calculates `mom_change` using the `PREV` window function. `PREV(SUM(PaymentsReceived.pay_amount), by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC()), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_received` (calculated as the sum) from the *previous* month's row in the `monthly_summary` collection, based on chronological order (`by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())`). The `default=0.0` ensures that for the very first month in the data, the previous value is treated as 0, so the MoM change is simply the `total_received` for that first month. The final `mom_change` is the current month's sum minus the previous month's sum.
4.  **`result = monthly_summary.ORDER_BY(...)`**: This final step sorts the results chronologically by year and then by month, ensuring the MoM changes are presented in a logical sequence.

*Note*: This query will only include months for which there is at least one record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. Months with absolutely no payment data will not appear in the result, as PyDough typically operates on existing data rather than generating full calendar sequences.","# CALCULATE year and MONTH for each payment received

    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those who have made at least one sale (`HAS(sales_made) == 1`). This prevents potential division-by-zero errors when calculating the average selling price.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each remaining salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them temporarily to avoid conflicts.
    *   `avg_selling_price=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP) by summing the `sale_price` of all sales made (`sales_made`) by the salesperson and dividing by the total count of their sales.
3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_selling_price.DESC())`**: Ranks the salespersons based on their calculated `avg_selling_price` in descending order (`DESC()`) and selects the top 3.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. Inside the first `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Select the salesperson's ID (`_id`), first name (`first_name`), and last name (`last_name`), renaming them to avoid potential conflicts and for clarity (`salesperson_id`, `sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`).
    *   Calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing (`SUM`) the `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (`sales_made.sale_price`). This aggregated value is named `total_sales`.
2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales.DESC())`**: We then use the `TOP_K` function to find the top 5 records.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=total_sales.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_sales` field (calculated in the previous step) in descending order (highest sales first).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to format the output according to the request:
    *   `ID=salesperson_id`: Selects the salesperson's ID and names the column `ID`.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`: Selects the first name and names the column `first_name`.
    *   `last_name=sp_last_name`: Selects the last name and names the column `last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount=total_sales`: Selects the calculated total sales amount and names the column `total_sales_amount`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HASNOT(sale_records)` function, which returns `True` (or 1 in PyDough comparison) if the `sale_records` sub-collection for a car is empty, meaning the car has never been sold.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**: For the cars that satisfy the `WHERE` condition (i.e., unsold cars), this selects and renames the required fields: `_id` (as `car_id`), `make` (as `car_make`), `model` (as `car_model`), and `year` (as `car_year`).

This effectively selects only those customers who have made at least one purchase (i.e., have at least one associated sale record).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: For the filtered customers, we use `CALCULATE` to select their unique identifier (`_id`) and rename it to `customer_id` in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it based on a condition.
2.  **`HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with each salesperson.

    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')`: Filters these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is 'Cash'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if *at least one* such cash payment exists for any sale made by the salesperson. If a salesperson has made any sale that received a cash payment, this condition evaluates to true for that salesperson.
3.  **`cash_payment_salespersons.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = _id)`**: From the filtered list of salespersons (those who have received at least one cash payment for a sale they made), we select only their unique identifier (`_id`) and rename it to `salesperson_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection, which contains information about all sales staff.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made) == 1)`**: This filters the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sales_made` is the sub-collection linking a salesperson to their sales records (as defined in the schema: `Salespersons.sales_made`).
    *   `HASNOT(sales_made)` checks if this sub-collection is empty for each salesperson.
    *   `== 1` ensures we keep only those salespersons for whom `HASNOT(sales_made)` is true (i.e., they have no sales records). This effectively performs the check similar to finding rows without a match in a left join scenario from SQL.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and potentially renames the fields for the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_sales_filter = DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30`**: This defines a reusable condition to check if a sale's `sale_date` occurred within the last 30 days from the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it.
3.  **`HAS(sales_made.WHERE(recent_sales_filter)) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider salespersons who have made at least one sale (`sales_made`) that satisfies the `recent_sales_filter`. This avoids calculating metrics for inactive salespersons.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required output fields:
    *   `salesperson_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `salesperson_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(recent_sales_filter))`: Counts the number of sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`) that meet the `recent_sales_filter`.
    *   `total_revenue_amount=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.WHERE(recent_sales_filter).sale_price), 0.0)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for the sales that meet the `recent_sales_filter`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if there were somehow no sales (despite the `HAS` filter), the revenue would be 0.0 instead of potentially null.
5.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_count.DESC())`**: This selects the top 5 records from the calculated results, ordered by the `total_sales_count` in descending order (highest count first).","# Define the filter condition for sales within the last 30 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve or derive necessary fields:
    *   `cust_state = customer.state`: Accesses the `state` of the `customer` linked to the sale.
    *   `sale_amount = sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price`.
    *   `cust_id = customer._id`: Retrieves the unique identifier (`_id`) of the customer associated with the sale, which is needed later for counting unique customers.

2.  **`state_sales_groups = sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `sales_info` collection using the `cust_state` calculated in the previous step. This groups all sales records by the state of the customer who made the purchase. The group for each state is named `state_group`.

3.  **`state_revenue_summary = state_sales_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: We apply a `CALCULATE` operation on the partitioned data (`state_sales_groups`). For each state partition:
    *   `state_name=cust_state`: We select the state name, which is the partition key.
    *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.cust_id)`: We count the number of distinct customer IDs (`cust_id`) within the sales records belonging to this state partition (`Sales` refers back to the collection being aggregated within the partition). This gives the count of unique customers who made purchases in this state.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_amount)`: We sum the `sale_amount` for all sales records within this state partition to get the total revenue for the state.

4.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: Finally, we select the top 5 resulting state records based on the calculated `total_revenue`, ordered in descending order (highest revenue first).","# CALCULATE state, sale price, and customer ID for each sale

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 3 payment methods based on the total amount received.
2.  **Required Information:** For each of these top 3 methods, return the payment method name, the total count of payments made using that method, and the total sum of payment amounts for that method.
3.  **Relevant Collection:** The `PaymentsReceived` collection contains the necessary information (`payment_method`, `payment_amount`).
4.  **Operation:**
    *   We need to group the payments by `payment_method`. This calls for `PARTITION`.
    *   For each payment method group, we need to calculate the sum of `payment_amount` and the count of payments (`COUNT(PaymentsReceived)` within the partition).

**Explanation:**

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""methods"", by=(payment_method))`: This groups all records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection based on their `payment_method`. Each group represents a unique payment method.

**Analysis of the Request:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 best-selling car *models* based on total revenue.
2.  **Data Needed:**
    *   Car make and model (from `Cars` collection).
    *   Sale price for each sale (from `Sales` collection).
3.  **Calculations:**
    *   Group cars by `make` and `model`.
    *   For each group (make/model combination), calculate:
        *   Total Revenue: Sum of `sale_price` for all sales of cars in that group.
        *   Total Number of Sales: Count of sales records for cars in that group.
4.  **Output:** Return `make`, `model`, `total_sales_count`, and `total_revenue` for the top 5 models ranked by `total_revenue`.

**PyDough Implementation Steps:**

1.  Start with the `Cars` collection, as it contains `make` and `model`.
2.  Use `PARTITION` to group the cars by `make` and `model`.
3.  Inside a `CALCULATE` after the `PARTITION`, compute the required aggregates:
    *   Use `COUNT(Cars.sale_records)` to get the total number of sales for cars within the partition group.
    *   Use `SUM(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)` to get the total revenue from the sales of cars within the partition group.
    *   Include the partition keys (`make`, `model`) in the `CALCULATE`.
4.  Use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 groups based on the calculated `total_revenue` in descending order.

```python
# Partition cars by make and model to calculate aggregates for each model
model_sales_revenue = Cars.PARTITION(name=""car_models"", by=(make, model)).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Cars.PARTITION(name=""car_models"", by=(make, model))`: This groups all records in the `Cars` collection based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group represents a specific car model.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`.

    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` from all `sale_records` linked to the cars in the current make/model group.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This selects the top 5 resulting rows (representing the top 5 car models) based on the `total_revenue` calculated in the previous step, ordered from highest revenue to lowest.
4.  `top_selling_models = ...`: The final result, containing the make, model, total sales count, and total revenue for the top 5 models, is assigned to the `top_selling_models` variable.","# PARTITION cars by make and model to CALCULATE aggregates for each model

**Explanation:**

2.  **`rep_first_name=first_name, rep_last_name=last_name`**: We select the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them to avoid potential conflicts and for clarity.
3.  **`total_sales_count=COUNT(...)`**: This calculates the total number of sales for each salesperson within the specified time frame.
    *   **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` table) for each salesperson and filter these sales.
    *   **`sale_date >= DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This condition filters the sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is on or after the date exactly 3 months prior to the current time (`now`). This effectively selects sales from the past 3 months, inclusive of today.
    *   **`COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of sales records that satisfy the `WHERE` condition for each salesperson.
4.  **`total_revenue_calc=SUM(...)`**: This calculates the total revenue generated by each salesperson within the specified time frame.
    *   **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: The same filtering logic as above is applied to select sales within the last 3 months.
    *   **`.sale_price`**: We access the `sale_price` field from the filtered sales records.
    *   **`SUM(...)`**: Sums up the `sale_price` of all filtered sales for each salesperson, giving their total revenue for the period.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(termination_date) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is present (not null). This ensures we only consider salespersons who have actually been terminated.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary fields for the result:
    *   `salesperson_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates the full name by joining the `first_name` and `last_name` with a space.
    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the salesperson's phone number.
    *   `employment_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the duration of employment in days by finding the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date`.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_days.ASC())`**: This selects the single record (`1`) that has the minimum value for the calculated `employment_days` field, effectively finding the salesperson with the shortest employment duration among those terminated.

3.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`**: This condition checks if the payment was made on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., 'Monday', 'Saturday') from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))` checks if the extracted day name is either 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection to define the date boundaries for the ""previous ISO week"".
    *   `start_of_current_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week based on the current time ('now').
    *   `start_of_previous_week=DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-7 days')`: Takes the start of the current week and subtracts 7 days to find the start date of the previous week.
    *   `end_of_previous_week=DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-1 day')`: Takes the start of the current week and subtracts 1 day to find the end date of the previous week (effectively the day before the current week started).
2.  **`payments_last_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_of_previous_week` and `end_of_previous_week` available). The `WHERE` clause filters these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week (inclusive).
3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_last_week.PARTITION(...)`**: We use the `PARTITION` function on the filtered `payments_last_week`.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(payment_date, payment_method)`: Specifies that the payments should be grouped based on unique combinations of their `payment_date` and `payment_method`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output for each group.
    *   `payment_date=payment_date`, `payment_method=payment_method`: We select the partition keys themselves.
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: For each group (each specific day and payment method combination), we calculate the sum of the `payment_amount` from all the `PaymentsReceived` records belonging to that group.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(payment_date.ASC(), payment_method.ASC())`**: This optional step sorts the final results first by date (ascending) and then by payment method (ascending) for easier reading.
6.  **`result = daily_totals_by_method`**: The final calculated and grouped data is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Define the start and end dates for the previous ISO week

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_info_2023`)**:
    *   Starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   Filters records to include only those where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Extract the customer's state using `customer.state` and assign it to `cust_state`.
        *   Calculate the starting month of the quarter (1 for Q1, 4 for Q2, 7 for Q3, 10 for Q4) using mathematical operations on the `sale_date` month.
        *   Construct a string representing the first date of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01"", ""2023-04-01"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for proper month formatting. This string (`quarter_start_date_str`) will serve as one of the grouping keys.
        *   Keep the `sale_price` and assign it to `price` for later aggregation.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`quarterly_sales_by_state`)**:
    *   Takes the prepared `sales_info_2023` data.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group the sales records.
        *   `name=""state_quarter_group""` assigns a name to the partition context.
        *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start_date_str)` specifies that grouping should happen based on the unique combinations of customer state and the calculated quarter start date string.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data to:
        *   Select the `cust_state` (renamed to `state`) and `quarter_start_date_str` (renamed to `quarter_start`) which are the grouping keys.
        *   Calculate the `total_quarterly_sales` for each group by applying the `SUM` aggregation function to the `price` of the `Sales` records belonging to that specific state/quarter partition.

3.  **Final Result (`result`)**:
    *   Assigns the result of the partitioning and aggregation to the `result` variable.
    *   Applies `ORDER_BY` to sort the final output first by state alphabetically (`state.ASC()`) and then by the quarter start date chronologically (`quarter_start.ASC()`).","# Filter sales for the year 2023 and CALCULATE necessary fields

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.inventory_snapshots`**: We start by accessing the `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection for each car in the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`WHERE(...)`**: This clause filters the snapshots based on multiple conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`: Filters for snapshots taken in the year 2023.
    *   `MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`: Filters for snapshots taken in the month of March.
    *   `is_in_inventory == True`: Filters for snapshots where the car was recorded as being in inventory.
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`: This is a window function that ranks the snapshots *within each car's group* (`per=""Cars""`). It orders them by `snapshot_date` in descending order (`DESC`), meaning the latest snapshot gets rank 1. We keep only the snapshot with rank 1 for each car that meets the other criteria.
3.  **`.car`**: After filtering the snapshots to get only the latest one for March 2023 where the car was in inventory, we navigate back to the `car` associated with that specific snapshot record.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select the required fields from the identified cars: `_id` (renamed to `car_id`), `make` (renamed to `car_make`), `model` (renamed to `car_model`), and `year` (renamed to `car_year`).
5.  **`result = ...`**: The final collection containing the details of the cars found is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Find the latest inventory snapshot for each car within March 2023 WHERE the car was in inventory.
