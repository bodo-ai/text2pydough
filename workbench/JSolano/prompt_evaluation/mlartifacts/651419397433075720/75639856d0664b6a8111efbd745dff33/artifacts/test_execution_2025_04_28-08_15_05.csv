**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Filters customers using `WHERE` to include only those with 5 or more transactions (`COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer.
        *   `total_trans`: The total number of transactions made by the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `successful_trans`: The number of successful transactions. This is done by counting transactions within `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `'Completed'`. **Note:** This assumes 'Completed' signifies a successful transaction; this value might need adjustment based on the actual data.

2.  **`customer_success_rates = customer_transaction_counts.CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`**:
    *   Takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_counts`.
    *   Uses another `CALCULATE` to compute the `success_rate`. It divides the `successful_trans` by `total_trans` (calculated in the previous step) and multiplies by `100.0` to get a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.
    *   Selects the final required fields: `customer_name` and the calculated `success_rate`.
    *   Uses `ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())` to sort the results based on the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).",23.307597875595093,"# Calculate transaction counts for customers with at least 5 transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window:**
    *   `start_period_date` is calculated as the start of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week's start using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')`.
    *   `end_period_date` is calculated as the start of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. This ensures the current week is excluded.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions:**
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Transactions` collection to include only records where `date_time` falls within the calculated `start_period_date` (inclusive) and `end_period_date` (exclusive).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction:
        *   `week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: Calculates the starting date of the week the transaction occurred in.
        *   `is_weekend_transaction = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Determines if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`, resulting in a boolean (True/False) or equivalent integer (1/0).

3.  **Partition by Week:**
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_groups"", by=(week_start))`: Groups the prepared transaction data (`transactions_in_period`) into partitions based on the unique `week_start` date.

4.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates:**
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Operates on each partition (each week):
        *   `week_starting = week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (the partition key).
        *   `total_transactions_count = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific week's partition.
        *   `weekend_transactions_count = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction` flag (treating True as 1 and False as 0) for transactions within that week's partition to get the count of weekend transactions.

5.  **Order Results:**
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries in ascending order based on the `week_starting` date.

6.  **Assign Result:**
    *   `result = weekly_summary`: Assigns the final calculated and ordered weekly summary to the `result` variable.",24.52826285362244,"# Define the start and end dates for the 8-week period excluding the current week

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:**
    *   `start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week prior to the current one. It takes the current timestamp (`'now'`), finds the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and subtracts 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
    *   `end_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp marking the end of last week, which is exactly the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`).
2.  **Filter Transactions:**
    *   Starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Uses `WHERE` to apply filters:
        *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Selects transactions linked to customers whose country is ""USA"".
        *   `date_time >= start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction date is on or after the start of last week.
        *   `date_time < end_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction date is before the start of the current week (effectively including only dates within last week).
    *   The result of this filtering is assigned to `usa_last_week_transactions`.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates:**
    *   Uses the top-level `Broker` collection's `CALCULATE` method to compute the final results based on the filtered transactions.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(usa_last_week_transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions in the filtered set.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(usa_last_week_transactions.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field for all transactions in the filtered set.

2.  **`ranked_customer_data = customer_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the results from the previous step and adds the customer rank (`CR`):

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This variable filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `WHERE(...)`: It keeps only transactions where:
        *   `transaction_type == 'buy'`: The transaction is a buy.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: The difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 10 days or less.
    *   `CALCULATE(ticker_sym = ticker.symbol)`: It extracts the stock ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`) from the related `ticker` record and assigns it to a new field `ticker_sym` to be used for grouping.

2.  **`ticker_groups`**: This variable takes the filtered transactions and groups them.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""ticker_group"", by=(ticker_sym))`: It partitions (groups) the `recent_buy_transactions` based on the unique values of `ticker_sym`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_sym`: It outputs the ticker symbol.
        *   `num_buy_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: It counts the number of transactions belonging to that specific ticker symbol group within the filtered set.

3.  **`top_2_frequent_tickers`**: This variable selects the top results.
    *   `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())`: It selects the top 2 rows from `ticker_groups`, ordered by `num_buy_transactions` in descending order (most frequent first).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the time boundaries using the `Broker` high-level collection. `current_month_start` is calculated as the first moment of the current month, and `six_months_ago_start` is calculated as the first moment of the month that was 6 months before the current month.
2.  **`customers_in_period = time_boundaries.Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the calculated time range (greater than or equal to `six_months_ago_start` and less than `current_month_start`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(signup_month = ...)`**: For the filtered customers, we create a new field `signup_month` by concatenating the year and zero-padded month from their `join_date`, resulting in a 'YYYY-MM' format suitable for grouping.
4.  **`monthly_customer_metrics = customers_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `customers_in_period` collection using the `signup_month` as the key. This groups customers based on the month they signed up.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each partition (each signup month):
    *   `signup_month = signup_month`: We include the signup month in the output.
    *   `pmcs = COUNT(Customers)`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` records within the current partition group.
    *   `pmat = AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction amount (PMAT) by taking the average of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the customers within the current partition group.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`**: The final results are ordered chronologically by the signup month.
7.  **`result = monthly_customer_metrics`**: The final calculated metrics per signup month are assigned to the `result` variable.",23.218116283416748,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the month 6 months prior

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_data = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to bring the `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record into the current context and keep the `date` field, renaming them `ticker_type` and `price_date` respectively.
2.  **`recent_prices = price_data.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `price_data` to include only records where the `price_date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATEDIFF(""days"", price_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between the `price_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) and keeping records where this difference is 6 or less (covering today and the previous 6 days).
3.  **`ticker_type_groups = recent_prices.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `recent_prices` based on the `ticker_type`. This groups all the price records from the last 7 days by their corresponding ticker type. Each group is named `type_group`.
4.  **`acp_by_type = ticker_type_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition group (each unique `ticker_type`), we calculate the final result.
    *   `ticker_type=ticker_type`: We select the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP=AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: We calculate the Average Closing Price (ACP) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `close` field of the `DailyPrices` records belonging to the current partition group (which already contains only prices from the last 7 days for that specific ticker type).",25.780834197998047,"# Calculate ticker_type and store the date for filtering

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022`**: Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is in the year 2022.
2.  **`customer_info`**: Calculates two boolean flags for each customer from `customers_2022`:
    *   `has_transactions`: True if the customer has at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
    *   `is_active`: True if the customer's `status` is 'Active'. It also selects the `country`.
3.  **`customers_with_transactions`**: Filters `customer_info` to keep only those customers who have transactions (`has_transactions == 1`). These are the customers relevant for the AR calculation's denominator.
4.  **`country_groups`**: Partitions the `customers_with_transactions` collection by `country`. This groups the relevant customers based on their country.
5.  **`country_ar_calcs`**: Calculates aggregates for each country group:
    *   `country`: The country name (partition key).
    *   `total_with_trans`: Counts the total number of customers within that country group (all of whom joined in 2022 and have transactions).
    *   `active_with_trans`: Sums the `is_active` flag for customers in the group, effectively counting the active customers with transactions.
6.  **`result`**: Calculates the final `activity_ratio` (AR) for each country using the formula provided in the request: `100.0 * active_with_trans / total_with_trans`. The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_with_trans` might be zero (although unlikely due to the earlier filter) to prevent division by zero, returning 0.0 in that case.

4.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This is the first condition.
    *   `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's `name` to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two checks, so the customer's name must satisfy at least one of them.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This is the second condition.
    *   `LOWER(state)`: Converts the customer's `state` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')`: Checks if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sell_transactions_last_month = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `transaction_type == 'sell'`: It selects only transactions where the type is 'sell'.
    *   `date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: It further filters these transactions to include only those that occurred on or after the date exactly one month prior to the current time (`'now'`).
2.  **`ticker_spm_calculation = sell_transactions_last_month.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered sell transactions.
    *   `name=""ticker_group""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(ticker.symbol)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique stock ticker symbol associated with each transaction (`ticker.symbol`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the required values for each ticker symbol group created by the partition.
    *   `ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `spm=IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM).
        *   `SUM(Transactions.amount)`, `SUM(Transactions.tax)`, `SUM(Transactions.commission)`: These calculate the total amount, tax, and commission for all 'sell' transactions *within the current ticker symbol group* over the specified period.
        *   `(SUM(Transactions.amount) - (SUM(Transactions.tax) + SUM(Transactions.commission))) * 100.0 / SUM(Transactions.amount)`: This applies the SPM formula using the aggregated sums for the group. `100.0` is used to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.
        *   `IFF(SUM(Transactions.amount) == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This handles the edge case where a ticker might have sell transactions with a total amount of zero within the period. In such cases, it assigns an SPM of `0.0` to avoid division by zero errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a `month_str` in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent grouping and sorting. It also retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker` record. The original `close`, `high`, and `low` values remain accessible for later aggregation.
2.  **`ticker_monthly_groups = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data first by `symbol` and then by the calculated `month_str`. This creates groups for each unique ticker-month combination.
3.  **`monthly_aggregates = ticker_monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each ticker-month partition, this step calculates the required aggregates: `avg_close` (average of `DailyPrices.close`), `max_high` (maximum of `DailyPrices.high`), and `min_low` (minimum of `DailyPrices.low`). It retains the `symbol` and `month` (renamed from `month_str`) keys.
4.  **`result = monthly_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is the final calculation step applied to the monthly aggregated data.
    *   It keeps the `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`.
    *   It uses the `PREV(avg_close, by=month.ASC(), per=""symbol"")` window function. This function looks at the previous record within the *same symbol's data* (due to `per=""symbol""`), ordered chronologically by `month` (due to `by=month.ASC()`), and retrieves its `avg_close` value.
    *   It calculates `momc` (Month-over-Month Change) using the formula `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles edge cases: if `prev_month_avg_close` is `None` (i.e., it's the first month for that ticker) or if it's `0` (to prevent division by zero), `momc` is set to `None`; otherwise, the calculation proceeds.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted alphabetically by ticker `symbol` and then chronologically by `month`.",50.87489056587219,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string and ticker symbol

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ticker_data = Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection. For each ticker, we calculate:
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the stock's symbol.
    *   `prices_in_range=historical_prices.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `historical_prices` sub-collection to include only records where the `date` is between ""2023-04-01"" and ""2023-04-04"", inclusive.
    *   `max_high_period=MAX(prices_in_range.high)`: Finds the highest `high` price among the filtered `prices_in_range` for that specific ticker.
    *   `min_low_period=MIN(prices_in_range.low)`: Finds the lowest `low` price among the filtered `prices_in_range` for that specific ticker.
2.  **`price_changes = ticker_data.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the results of the first one. This allows us to use the `max_high_period` and `min_low_period` calculated previously.
    *   `ticker_symbol=ticker_symbol`: Keeps the ticker symbol.
    *   `price_change=max_high_period - min_low_period`: Calculates the difference between the maximum high and minimum low found in the date range for each ticker.
    *   `.WHERE(price_change != None)`: Filters out any results where `price_change` is null, which would happen if a ticker had no price data within the specified date range.
3.  **`top_3_stocks_by_price_change = price_changes.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 records from the `price_changes` collection, ordered by the `price_change` field in descending order (highest change first).

It then counts these filtered transactions using `COUNT()` and assigns the result to `num_transactions_in_join_month`.
3.  `TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())` selects the single customer record with the highest count of transactions made in their joining month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we navigate to the linked `customer` to get their `state` and to the linked `ticker` to get its `ticker_type`. We assign these to new temporary fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition (group) the results based on the unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. Each group in the partition represents one unique combination.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition group (each unique state/ticker type combination), we calculate:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: We select the state from the partition key.
    *   `ticker_type=tick_type`: We select the ticker type from the partition key.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: We count the number of original `Transactions` that fall into this specific group (combination).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions where the difference in days between the `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. It then uses `CALCULATE` to extract the customer's country (`customer.country`) into a new field `cust_country` (needed for partitioning) and keeps the transaction `amount` as `trans_amount`.
2.  **`country_groups`**: This partitions the `recent_transactions` based on the `cust_country`. For each country group, it calculates:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country (from the partition key `cust_country`).
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of transactions within that country group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of transaction amounts (`amount`) for that country group using `SUM(Transactions.amount)`.
3.  **`top_5_countries_by_amount`**: This takes the `country_groups` results and selects the top 5 rows based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order using `TOP_K`. It then uses `CALCULATE` to select the final required fields: `country_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range:** We first define the time window for the ""past 7 days"". `start_date_past_7_days` is calculated as 7 days before the start of the current day, and `end_date_past_7_days` is the start of the current day. This ensures we look at the 7 full calendar days preceding today.
2.  **Filter Ticker:** We start with the `Tickers` collection and use `WHERE` to filter for the specific ticker symbol `'VTI'`.
3.  **Calculate Minimum Price:** We use `CALCULATE` on the filtered ticker.
    *   `symbol=symbol`: We include the symbol in the output for clarity.
    *   `lowest_close_price=MIN(...)`: We calculate the minimum closing price.
        *   `historical_prices`: We access the related daily prices for the 'VTI' ticker.
        *   `.WHERE(...)`: We filter these daily prices to include only those where the `date` is greater than or equal to the `start_date_past_7_days` and less than the `end_date_past_7_days`.
        *   `.close`: We specify that we want to operate on the `close` field of the filtered daily prices.
        *   `MIN()`: This aggregation function finds the minimum value among the closing prices of the filtered records.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This selects only the customers who have at least one transaction associated with them by checking if the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each selected customer.
3.  `customer_id=_id`: Selects the customer's unique identifier (`_id`) and renames it to `customer_id`.
4.  `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: For each customer, this finds the minimum (earliest) `date_time` among all their transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
5.  `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`: This calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and the earliest transaction date found in the previous step.
6.  `time_to_first_transaction_days=...`: Assigns the calculated difference to the field `time_to_first_transaction_days`.

The final result `customer_first_transaction_time` will contain the `customer_id` and the calculated time difference in days for each customer who has made at least one transaction.",17.55431580543518,"# Filter customers to include only those who have made at least one transaction.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_filter`**: This defines a reusable condition to identify transactions that are of type 'sell' and occurred exactly on the date '2023-04-01' by checking the year, month, and day components of the `date_time` field.
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Customers` collection to keep only those who have at least one transaction matching the `transaction_filter`. The `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(transaction_filter)) == 1` check ensures we only consider customers who actually made relevant transactions.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates:
    *   `customer_id`: Renames the `_id` field.
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `transaction_count`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer (`transactions_made`) that satisfy the `transaction_filter`.
4.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())`**: This selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `transaction_count`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the customer with the most transactions is ranked first.
5.  **`result = top_customer_by_transactions`**: The final result containing the `_id`, `name`, and transaction count of the top customer is assigned to the `result` variable.",21.459831714630127,"# Define the filter condition for transactions made on 2023-04-01 with type 'sell'

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step starts with the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on three conditions using `WHERE`:
    *   `status == ""Success""`: Selects only transactions marked as successful.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), representing the first quarter.
    *   It then uses `CALCULATE` to create a new field `transaction_month_str` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) into a 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., ""2023-01""). This standardized string will be used for grouping.

2.  **`monthly_groups`**: This step takes the `filtered_transactions` and partitions them using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""monthly_trans""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created within the partition context.
    *   `by=(transaction_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of the `transaction_month_str` field created in the previous step.

3.  **`monthly_average_prices`**: This step operates on the partitioned data (`monthly_groups`).
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to compute the final results for each group (each month).
    *   `month=transaction_month_str`: Selects the month string (the partition key) for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price=AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to that specific month's group. Note that `Transactions.price` refers back to the `price` field within the `Transactions` collection associated with each partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result chronologically by month.

4.  **`result = monthly_average_prices`**: Assigns the final calculated monthly averages to the `result` variable.",19.43232107162476,"# Filter transactions for successful ones in the first quarter of 2023
