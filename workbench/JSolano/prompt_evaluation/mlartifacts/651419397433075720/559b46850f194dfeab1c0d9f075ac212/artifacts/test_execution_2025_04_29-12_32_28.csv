**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects only those customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the entries in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first step)**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `total_transactions`: Counts all transactions for the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `successful_transactions`: Counts only the transactions where the `status` field is exactly 'Success'. *Note: This assumes 'Success' is the indicator of a successful transaction. If the status indicator is different (e.g., 'Completed'), this string should be adjusted.*
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second step)**: This step takes the results from the previous step and calculates:
    *   `customer_name`: Keeps the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate`: Calculates the success rate by dividing the count of successful transactions by the total count and multiplying by 100.0 to get a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: This sorts the final results based on the calculated `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest success rate first).
5.  **`result = ...`**: The final ordered list of customers and their success rates is assigned to the `result` variable.",22.82849645614624,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for customers with at least 5 transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate two key date boundaries using the top-level `Broker` collection:
    *   `start_current_week`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week (e.g., the preceding Sunday or Monday, depending on configuration).
    *   `start_of_window`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week that was 8 weeks before the current week's start.
2.  **`filtered_transactions = time_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection and apply filters:
    *   `ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Ensures we only consider transactions related to tickers classified as ""stock"".
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_window) & (date_time < start_current_week)`: Selects transactions that occurred within the 8-week period *before* the current week.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the transaction's day name is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" and returns `True` (1) if it is, `False` (0) otherwise.
4.  **`weekly_groups = filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_transactions` collection.
    *   `name=""weeks""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(week_start)`: Groups the transactions based on the calculated `week_start` date.
5.  **`weekly_stats = weekly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (week) created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `week_starting = week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (the partition key).
    *   `total_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific week's partition.
    *   `weekend_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend)`: Sums the `is_weekend` flag for all transactions in that week's partition. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this effectively counts the weekend transactions.
6.  **`result = weekly_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects the final required columns: `week_starting`, `total_transactions`, and `weekend_transactions`.
7.  **`.ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results chronologically based on the week's starting date.",27.36560797691345,"# Define the time boundaries: start of the current week and start of the 8-week window prior

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Broker` collection.

    *   `start_of_this_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week.
2.  **`usa_transactions_last_week = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection based on the previously calculated boundaries and customer location.
    *   It accesses the `Transactions` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_of_last_week` and `start_of_this_week` available).
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Filters for transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week) & (date_time < start_of_this_week)`: Filters transactions whose `date_time` falls within last week (from the start of last week up to, but not including, the start of this week).
3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs the final aggregation on the filtered transactions using the top-level `Broker` collection again.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(usa_transactions_last_week)`: Counts the number of transactions in the filtered `usa_transactions_last_week` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is 'buy' and the `date_time` is within the last 10 days from the current time (using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`).
2.  **`transactions_with_symbol`**: This takes the filtered transactions and uses `CALCULATE` to add a new field `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` from the related `ticker` record (`ticker.symbol`). This is necessary because `PARTITION` requires the grouping key to be a direct field of the collection being partitioned.
3.  **`ticker_buy_counts`**: This partitions the `transactions_with_symbol` collection by the `ticker_symbol`. For each unique `ticker_symbol`, it calculates the `ticker_symbol` itself and the total count of transactions (`num_buy_transactions`) within that group using `COUNT(transactions_with_symbol)`.
4.  **`top_2_tickers`**: This applies the `TOP_K` function to the `ticker_buy_counts` collection, selecting the 2 records with the highest `num_buy_transactions` in descending order.
5.  **`result = top_2_tickers`**: The final result containing the top 2 ticker symbols and their corresponding buy transaction counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",28.648033380508423,"# Filter transactions to include only 'buy' type within the last 10 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: Calculates the start date of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the start date of the month 6 months prior (`six_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function. This defines the time window for customer signups.
2.  **`customers_in_period`**: Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls between `six_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and `current_month_start` (exclusive). It then calculates the signup year and month number, and creates a formatted string `signup_month_str` (e.g., ""2023-01"") for easy grouping and sorting.
3.  **`monthly_customer_groups`**: Partitions the filtered customers based on their `signup_month_str`. This groups customers who signed up in the same calendar month.
4.  **`monthly_metrics`**: Calculates the required metrics for each group (each signup month):
    *   `signup_month`: Retrieves the signup month string from the partition key.
    *   `pmcs`: Counts the number of `Customers` within each monthly partition group (Per Month Customer Signups).
    *   `pmat`: Calculates the average `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within that specific signup month group (Per Month Average Transaction Amount).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_price_info = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection and filter it to include only records where the date is within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). This is done using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and the condition selects records whose date is 0 to 6 days prior to now.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_type = ticker.ticker_type, close_price = close)`**: Within the filtered records, we calculate two fields:
    *   `ticker_type`: We access the `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record. This is needed for partitioning.
    *   `close_price`: We explicitly bring the `close` price into the calculation context, although the final aggregation will reference `DailyPrices.close`.
3.  **`type_groups = recent_price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `recent_price_info` collection.
    *   `name=""type_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (optional but good practice).
    *   `by=(ticker_type)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values of the `ticker_type` field calculated in the previous step.
4.  **`result = type_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a calculation on each partition group (`type_groups`).
    *   `ticker_type = ticker_type`: We select the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP = AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: We calculate the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each group. `AVG(DailyPrices.close)` computes the average of the `close` field for all the `DailyPrices` records that belong to the current `ticker_type` group within the partition.",27.726361513137817,"# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days (inclusive) and get necessary fields

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_joined_2022 = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`**: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the year 2022.
2.  **`country_groups = customers_joined_2022.PARTITION(name=""country_partition"", by=(country))`**: This partitions the filtered customers based on their `country`. Each partition (`country_partition`) will contain customers from the same country who joined in 2022.
3.  **`country_counts = country_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates aggregated values for each country partition:
    *   `country = country`: Selects the country name for the group.
    *   `total_cust_with_trans = COUNT(Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`: Counts the number of customers *within the current country partition* who have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This represents the denominator for the AR calculation.
    *   `active_cust_with_trans = COUNT(Customers.WHERE((status == 'Active') & (HAS(transactions_made) == 1)))`: Counts the number of customers *within the current country partition* who are marked as 'Active' and have also made at least one transaction. This represents the numerator for the AR calculation.
4.  **`country_activity_ratio = country_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs the final AR calculation:
    *   `country = country`: Selects the country name again.
    *   `AR = IFF(total_cust_with_trans > 0, (active_cust_with_trans / total_cust_with_trans) * 100.0, 0.0)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio (AR) by dividing the count of active customers with transactions by the total count of customers with transactions and multiplying by 100. The `IFF` function handles cases where `total_cust_with_trans` might be zero (meaning no customers in that country cohort had transactions) to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` in such cases.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because we need a final aggregated count. `CALCULATE` is used to compute this single value.
2.  **`num_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_customers` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We apply the `COUNT` function to the `Customers` collection after filtering it with the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part filters customers based on their name.
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|` (OR) combines these two conditions, so customers whose name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez' are included.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This part filters customers based on their state.
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the state to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
6.  **`&`**: The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition and the state condition, ensuring that only customers who satisfy *both* sets of criteria are counted.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"" and the `date_time` is within the last month (from exactly one month ago up to the current time, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
2.  **`ticker_groups`**: The filtered transactions are then partitioned into groups based on the `ticker.symbol`. Each group contains all the relevant sell transactions for a specific ticker symbol.
3.  **`ticker_aggregates`**: For each `ticker_group`, this step calculates the sum of `amount` (aliased as `total_amount_sells`), the sum of `tax` (`total_tax`), and the sum of `commission` (`total_commission`) from the transactions within that group. It also includes the `ticker_symbol` (the partition key).
4.  **`result`**: This final step calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) for each ticker using the formula provided in the request: `(Total Amount from Sells - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100.0`.
    *   An `IFF` function is used to check if `total_amount_sells` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors. Otherwise, the SPM is calculated normally.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step accesses the `DailyPrices` collection and calculates necessary intermediate fields:
    *   `symbol`: Retrieves the ticker symbol from the related `Tickers` collection.
    *   `year`, `month_num`: Extracts the year and month number for sorting.
    *   `month_formatted`: Creates the 'YYYY-MM' string for grouping and final display using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` (to ensure two-digit months like '01').
    *   `close_price`, `high_price`, `low_price`: Renames the original price fields for clarity (though using original names directly in aggregations is also possible).
2.  **`ticker_months_grouped = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the prepared daily data first by `symbol` and then by the `month_formatted` string. Each resulting group contains all daily price records for a specific ticker in a specific month.
3.  **`monthly_stats = ticker_months_grouped.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each partition group created above. It calculates:
    *   `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`: Aggregates (Average, Maximum, Minimum) are computed using the daily prices (`DailyPrices.close_price`, etc.) within that specific ticker-month group.
    *   `year`, `month_num`: These are retrieved using `MIN` (or `MAX`) to get a single scalar value representing the year/month of the group, needed for chronological sorting later.
    *   `symbol`, `month`: The partition keys are retained.
4.  **`symbol_monthly_groups = monthly_stats.PARTITION(...)`**: This re-partitions the results, this time only by `symbol`. Each group now contains all the *monthly* aggregate rows for a single ticker.
5.  **`result = symbol_monthly_groups.monthly_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculation happens *within* each symbol's group of monthly stats.
    *   It accesses the monthly data for the current symbol via the sub-collection named `monthly_stats` (the name of the collection partitioned in the previous step).
    *   `prev_avg_close=PREV(...)`: The `PREV` function looks up the `avg_close` value from the *previous* row within the current symbol's group. The `by=(year.ASC(), month_num.ASC())` clause ensures rows are ordered chronologically (year first, then month) before `PREV` operates. `default=None` handles the first month for each ticker where there's no previous month.
    *   A second `CALCULATE` is used because the result of `PREV` (`prev_avg_close`) is needed to compute `momc`.
    *   `momc=IFF(...)`: Calculates the Month-over-Month Change using the formula `(current - previous) / previous`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_avg_close` is `None` (first month) or `0` to avoid errors, returning `None` in those cases.
    *   Finally, it selects the required output columns: `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, and the calculated `momc`.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(...)`**: The final result set is ordered alphabetically by `symbol`, and then chronologically by `year` and `month_num` within each symbol.",51.59118628501892,"# Step 1: Prepare daily price data with necessary fields: symbol, year, month number, formatted month, close, high, low

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This defines a reusable expression `filtered_prices` that selects records from the `DailyPrices` collection where the `date` falls between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023, inclusive.
2.  **`tickers_in_range = Tickers.WHERE(HAS(filtered_prices) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Tickers` collection and filters it to include only those tickers that have at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) associated `DailyPrices` record matching the `filtered_prices` criteria. This ensures we only consider stocks with data in the specified period.
3.  **`tickers_in_range.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the filtered `tickers_in_range`.
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the stock's ticker symbol.
    *   `price_change=MAX(filtered_prices.high) - MIN(filtered_prices.low)`: For each ticker, it calculates the difference between the maximum `high` price and the minimum `low` price found within its associated `filtered_prices` records. This gives the total price range for that stock over the specified period.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 tickers based on the calculated `price_change`, ordering them in descending order (highest change first).

It also selects the customer's `_id` and `name` into new variables `cust_id` and `cust_name` to avoid naming conflicts and carry them forward.
2.  **`customer_transaction_counts = customer_join_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the previous result and, for each customer, counts their transactions (`transactions_made`) that occurred in the *same* year and month they joined. This is done by filtering `transactions_made` using a `WHERE` clause that compares `YEAR(date_time)` and `MONTH(date_time)` of the transaction with the previously calculated `join_year` and `join_month` of the customer. The count is stored in `num_transactions_in_join_month`. `cust_id` and `cust_name` are carried over.
3.  **`top_customer = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: This finds the single customer (`TOP_K(1, ...)`) who has the highest `num_transactions_in_join_month`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the state of the associated customer (`customer.state`) and the type of the associated ticker (`ticker.ticker_type`), assigning them to new temporary fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`state_ticker_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition the `transaction_info` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups the records based on the unique combinations of the values in the fields specified in the `by` parameter (`cust_state`, `tick_type`). Each group represents a unique combination of customer state and ticker type.
3.  **`group_counts = state_ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: On the partitioned data, we use `CALCULATE` again. For each group (combination):
    *   We select the partitioning keys `cust_state` and `tick_type` and rename them to `customer_state` and `ticker_type` for the final output.
    *   We use the aggregation function `COUNT(Transactions)` to count the number of original transaction records that fall into this specific group (combination), storing the result in `num_transactions`.
4.  **`top_5_combinations = group_counts.TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())`**: Finally, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 groups (combinations) based on the `num_transactions` field, sorting in descending order (`DESC()`) to get the combinations with the highest counts.
5.  **`result = top_5_combinations`**: The final result containing the top 5 combinations (customer state, ticker type, and transaction count) is assigned to the `result` variable.",22.360076665878296,"# Calculate customer state and ticker type for each transaction

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection. It uses `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 30` to keep only transactions where the difference between the transaction's `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 30 days or less. This effectively selects transactions from the past 30 days, inclusive.
2.  **`transactions_with_country = recent_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the filtered transactions and calculates a new field named `country` by accessing the `country` field from the related `customer` (`customer.country`). This makes the country directly accessible for partitioning.
3.  **`country_groups = transactions_with_country.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transactions_with_country` collection into groups based on the unique values in the `country` field. Each group represents a distinct country.
4.  **`country_aggregates = country_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each country group created by the partition. It calculates:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of transactions).
2.  **`num_transactions=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_transactions` which will hold the final count.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and filter it.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70`**: This is the filter condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)` calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and the current date.
    *   `<= 70` selects only those customers whose join date is within the last 70 days (inclusive).
5.  **`.transactions_made`**: For the customers who satisfy the `WHERE` condition, we access their associated transactions via the `transactions_made` sub-collection. This effectively gathers all transactions from all recently joined customers.
6.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the total number of transaction records collected in the previous step, giving the total number of transactions made by users who joined in the past 70 days.",14.06265664100647,"result = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

2.  **`.CALCULATE(cust_id=_id, join_dt=join_date, first_transaction_date=MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates:

    *   `join_dt`: Selects the `join_date`.
    *   `first_transaction_date`: Finds the minimum (earliest) `date_time` from all transactions associated with the customer using the `MIN` aggregation function.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=cust_id, days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_dt, first_transaction_date))`**: This second `CALCULATE` step uses the fields computed in the previous step:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sell_transactions_on_date_filter`**: This contextless expression defines the conditions for a transaction to be counted: it must be of type 'sell' and occur on the date 2023-04-01 (checked by comparing the YEAR, MONTH, and DAY components of the `date_time` field).
2.  **`customers_with_transactions`**: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who have at least one transaction (`HAS(...) == 1`) that matches the `sell_transactions_on_date_filter`. This avoids unnecessary calculations for customers with no relevant transactions.

2.  **`transactions_with_month = q1_2023_successful_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates a new field `month_year` by concatenating the year and the zero-padded month (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02"") from the `date_time`. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits for correct sorting and grouping.
3.  **`monthly_avg_price = transactions_with_month.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered and calculated data into groups based on the `month_year`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(month=month_year, average_transaction_price=AVG(Transactions.price))`**: For each partition (each month), this calculates the final output fields:
    *   `month`: Renames the `month_year` partition key to `month`.
    *   `average_transaction_price`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to that specific month's partition. We access `Transactions.price` here to refer back to the price values within the current partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_refs = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first establish the time boundaries. `current_week_start` gets the date of the beginning of the current week (e.g., the most recent Sunday or Monday, depending on configuration). `start_date` calculates the date 8 weeks prior to `current_week_start`, marking the beginning of our analysis period.
2.  **`relevant_payments = date_refs.Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering `Sales` to include only those with a `sale_price` greater than 30,000.
3.  **`.payment.WHERE(...)`**: We then access the `payment` sub-collection for these sales and filter the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within our desired range: on or after `start_date` and strictly before `current_week_start`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each relevant payment, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `payment_week_start`: The date corresponding to the start of the week in which the `payment_date` falls, using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend`: A boolean (represented as 1 or 0) indicating if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
5.  **`weekly_payment_groups = relevant_payments.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `relevant_payments` collection into groups based on the `payment_week_start`. Each group (""weeks"") contains all the relevant payments made within the same calendar week.
6.  **`weekly_summary = weekly_payment_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition group (each week):
    *   We select the `payment_week_start` (renamed to `week`).
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(payment)`: We count the total number of payment records within that week's group.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(payment.is_weekend)`: We sum the `is_weekend` flag (which is 1 for weekend payments, 0 otherwise) for all payments in that group, effectively counting only the weekend payments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to select and compute fields for each salesperson.
2.  **`salesperson_id = _id, sp_first_name = first_name, sp_last_name = last_name`**: We select the salesperson's ID, first name, and last name, renaming them for clarity.
3.  **`num_sales_last_30_days = COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_sales_last_30_days`.
4.  **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (which contains all sales for the current salesperson) and filter it using `WHERE`.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`**: This is the filter condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and today.
    *   `< 30` ensures we only include sales where the difference is 0 (today) up to 29 days ago, effectively covering the last 30 days inclusive of today.
6.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of sales records remaining in the `sales_made` sub-collection *after* the date filter has been applied.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars_with_sales = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`: It checks if the uppercase version of the `vin_number` contains the substring 'M5'. Using `UPPER` ensures case-insensitivity, and `LIKE` with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching anywhere within the VIN.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: It ensures that only cars with at least one associated sale record are considered.
2.  **`sales_count_by_model = filtered_cars_with_sales.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered cars and partitions (groups) them based on their `make` and `model`. The partition group is named `model_partition`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this calculates the final output for each group:
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` from the partition key.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` from the partition key.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with all the cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_latest_status`**: We start with the `Cars` collection. For each car, we calculate its `make`, `model`, and determine its latest inventory status.
    *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`: This finds the inventory snapshot record(s) with the most recent `snapshot_date` for each car (`per=""Cars""`).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` ensures at most one snapshot per car is selected, we use `SINGULAR()` to treat it as a single record.
    *   `.is_in_inventory`: We extract the inventory status from that latest snapshot.
    *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., True)`: If a car has no inventory snapshots, we default its status to `True` (in inventory) to be safe, though cars without sales records are filtered out later anyway.
2.  **`sold_cars_not_in_inventory`**: We filter the `cars_with_latest_status` collection to keep only cars where:
    *   `latest_is_in_inventory == False`: The car's most recent status indicates it's *not* in inventory.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: The car must have at least one corresponding record in the `Sales` collection (accessed via the `sale_records` relationship).
3.  **`make_model_groups`**: We partition the filtered cars (`sold_cars_not_in_inventory`) into groups based on their `make` and `model`.
4.  **`max_sale_prices`**: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   The `make` and `model` (which are the partition keys).
    *   `highest_sale_price`: We use the `MAX` aggregation function on the `sale_price` found within the `sale_records` of the cars belonging to that specific `make`/`model` group.
5.  **`result`**: Finally, we order these `make`/`model` groups based on their calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order using `ORDER_BY`.",27.62288808822632,"# Step 1: Calculate the latest inventory status for each car

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Calculation:** We first establish the time window using `Dealership.CALCULATE`. `current_month_start` is determined using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`, marking the exclusive end of our period. `period_start_date` is calculated as 6 months before `current_month_start`, marking the inclusive beginning of our period.
2.  **Filtering Sales:** We start with the `Sales` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `sale_date >= period_start_date` and `sale_date < current_month_start`: This selects sales within the last 6 full months prior to the current month.
    *   `YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) >= 2022` and `YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) <= 2023`: This filters for sales made by salespersons hired in the years 2022 or 2023.
3.  **Month Calculation:** We use `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month` field in the format ""YYYY-MM"" for each relevant sale. `LPAD` ensures the month part has two digits (e.g., ""04"" instead of ""4"") for correct sorting. The `sale_price` is also passed through.
4.  **Partitioning and Aggregation:**
    *   `PARTITION(name=""months"", by=(sale_month))`: This groups the `sales_with_month` data based on the unique values of `sale_month`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each month group created by the partition:
        *   `month=sale_month`: Selects the month identifier.
        *   `PMSPS=COUNT(Sales)`: Counts the number of sales records within that specific month's group.
        *   `PMSR=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales records within that month's group. Note that `COUNT(Sales)` and `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` refer to the original `Sales` records aggregated within the partition context.
5.  **Ordering:** Finally, `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically by the calculated month string.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_2023_info = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023. For each of these sales, it calculates two values: `revenue` (which is the `sale_price`) and `cost` (which is accessed from the related `car` record using `car.cost`).
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This starts a calculation at the top level of the database (`Dealership`).

5.  **`.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = IFF(...))`**: This performs the final GPM calculation using the aggregated totals.
    *   **`IFF(total_cost_2023 != 0, ...)`**: It first checks if `total_cost_2023` is not zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   **`(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`**: If the cost is not zero, it applies the GPM formula: (Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Cost, multiplied by 100.0 to get a percentage.
    *   **`None`**: If the total cost is zero, it returns `None`.

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `Sales` collection.
2.  We use `WHERE` to filter the sales. The condition inside `WHERE` uses `HAS` to check the related `inventory_snapshots` for the `car` associated with each sale (`Sales.car.inventory_snapshots`).
3.  The inner `WHERE` clause within `HAS` filters these snapshots to find entries where `is_in_inventory` is `False` (meaning the car left inventory) and the `snapshot_date` is equal to the `sale_date` of the sale record being evaluated. `HAS(...) == 1` ensures that at least one such matching snapshot exists.
4.  The result of the first step (`relevant_sales`) contains only sales that occurred on the same day the car was marked as out of inventory.
5.  We then apply `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` to `relevant_sales` to find the single sale record with the highest `sale_price`.
6.  Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the `top_sale` record to select the `make` and `model` from the related car (`car.make`, `car.model`) and the `sale_price` from the sale record itself.",22.52460265159607,"# Filter sales to find those where the car went out of inventory on the same day it was sold.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. It creates a new field `payment_month_str` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `payment_date`, resulting in a string like ""YYYY-MM"". It also keeps the `payment_amount` under the alias `payment_val`.
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `payment_info` data based on the unique `payment_month_str` values. For each month group (`payments_per_month`), it calculates the `month` (which is the `payment_month_str`) and the `total_payments` by summing the `payment_amount` of all original `PaymentsReceived` records belonging to that month.
3.  **`result = monthly_totals.ORDER_BY(month.ASC()).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   First, `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the aggregated monthly results chronologically based on the ""YYYY-MM"" string.
    *   Then, `CALCULATE` selects the `month` and `total_monthly_payments`.
    *   It calculates the `mom_change` using the `PREV` window function. `PREV(total_payments, by=month.ASC(), default=0.0)` fetches the `total_payments` value from the *previous* row in the sorted data (ordered by `month`). For the very first month in the dataset, where there's no preceding row, it defaults to `0.0`, ensuring the subtraction works correctly.
4.  **`monthly_payment_analysis = result`**: Assigns the final calculated data (month, total payments, MoM change) to the variable `monthly_payment_analysis`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters out any salespersons who have made zero sales using `HAS(sales_made) == 1`. This prevents potential division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
    *   `s_first_name=first_name`: Selects the first name and assigns it to `s_first_name`.
    *   `s_last_name=last_name`: Selects the last name and assigns it to `s_last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`).
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the results from the first one:
    *   `first_name=s_first_name`: Carries over the first name for the final result.
    *   `last_name=s_last_name`: Carries over the last name for the final result.
    *   `asp=total_sales_amount / num_sales`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP) using the defined formula.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=asp.DESC())`**: Selects the top 3 records based on the calculated `asp` field, ordered in descending order (highest ASP first). The final result includes the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `asp` for these top 3 salespersons.",17.44618558883667,"salesperson_asp = Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  The code starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  It uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `salesperson_id`: Renames the `_id` field.
    *   `sp_first_name`: Takes the `first_name`.
    *   `sp_last_name`: Takes the `last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all related sales records found in the `sales_made` sub-collection for that salesperson.
3.  It then applies `TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last'))` to the result of the `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   This selects the top 5 records based on the `total_sales_amount`.
    *   `.DESC(na_pos='last')` ensures the sorting is done in descending order (highest sales first) and that any salespersons with a NULL `total_sales_amount` (which shouldn't happen with SUM unless all inputs are NULL, but handles the requirement) are placed at the end of the sorted list.
4.  The final result, containing the ID, first name, last name, and total sales amount for the top 5 salespersons, is assigned to the `result` variable.",18.68225622177124,"# Calculate total sales for each salesperson by summing the sale_price from their associated sales records.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: We filter this collection. The `HASNOT(sale_records)` function checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to `Sales`) is empty for each car. We keep only those cars where this condition is true (i.e., they have no associated sales records).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the cars that passed the filter, we select and rename the required fields:

2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the salespersons based on a condition.
3.  **`HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'cash')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering logic:

3.  **`recent_sales_list=sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30)`**: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection. We then filter these sales using `WHERE` to keep only those where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. The result of this filtered list is stored in `recent_sales_list`.
4.  **`.WHERE(HAS(recent_sales_list) == 1)`**: After calculating the `recent_sales_list`, we filter the `Salespersons` collection to ensure we only keep those who have at least one sale (`HAS(recent_sales_list) == 1`) in the specified 30-day period.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.PARTITION(name=""car_models"", by=(make, model))`**: This groups the `Cars` collection by unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group represents a specific car model.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each `car_model` group created by the partition:
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the car make (partition key).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the car model (partition key).
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for the current model group by summing the `sale_price` from all associated `sale_records` within that group. `Cars.sale_records` here refers to the sales records linked to the cars belonging to the specific make/model group.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of sales records for the current model group.
3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This selects the top 5 groups (car models) based on the calculated `total_revenue`, ordered in descending order (highest revenue first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window:**

    *   `end_date_today = DATETIME('now')`: Gets the current date and time.

2.  **Calculate Metrics per Salesperson:**
    *   `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and calculates new fields for each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name, sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them temporarily to avoid conflicts.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(...))`: Counts the sales records (`sales_made`) associated with the salesperson, but only includes sales where the `sale_date` falls within the calculated 3-month window (`>= start_date_3m` and `<= end_date_today`).
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(...).sale_price)`: Sums the `sale_price` for the same filtered set of sales records within the 3-month window, effectively calculating the revenue for that period.

3.  **Filter and Rank:**
    *   `.WHERE(total_revenue > 0)`: Filters out any salespersons who had zero revenue during the specified period.
    *   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Selects the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated `total_revenue` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Create a `salesperson_name` field by joining `first_name` and `last_name`.
    *   Select the `phone` field and rename it to `phone_number`.
    *   Calculate `employment_duration_days` by finding the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using the `DATEDIFF` function.
2.  **`.WHERE(employment_duration_days != None)`**: We filter the results to include only those salespersons for whom the `employment_duration_days` could be calculated (i.e., they have a `termination_date`). This assumes `DATEDIFF` returns `None` if `termination_date` is missing or null.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`**: We use `TOP_K` to find the single record (`1`) with the minimum `employment_duration_days`. We specify `.ASC()` to sort in ascending order (shortest duration first).
4.  **`result = shortest_employment_salesperson`**: The final collection, containing the salesperson with the shortest employment duration and their details (name, phone, duration in days), is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.829381704330444,"# Calculate the employment duration in days for each salesperson

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the date boundaries for the ""previous ISO week"".
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` calculates the start date (Monday) of the week *before* the current one.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` calculates the start date (Monday) of the *current* week. We use this as the *exclusive* end date for the previous week's filtering.
2.  **`payments_prev_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection via the `date_boundaries` context (which provides the calculated dates).
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters payments to include only those where the `payment_date` is on or after the start of the previous week (`>= start_prev_iso_week`) AND strictly before the start of the current week (`< start_curr_iso_week`).
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` extracts the date part (`payment_day`) using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` for daily grouping, and keeps `payment_method` and `payment_amount`.
3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered payments.
    *   `name=""daily_payment_groups""` assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_day, payment_method)` groups the records first by the day of payment and then by the payment method within that day.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group.
    *   `payment_day=payment_day` and `payment_method=payment_method` select the partition keys.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)` calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific day/payment method group. Note that we refer back to the original collection (`PaymentsReceived`) within the `SUM` function as required when aggregating inside a `PARTITION`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, we calculate:
    *   `cust_state`: The state of the customer associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
    *   `quarter_start_month`: An intermediate calculation to find the number of months to add to the start of the year to get the quarter's start month (0 for Q1, 3 for Q2, 6 for Q3, 9 for Q4).
    *   `quarter_start`: The actual starting date of the quarter. We use the `DATETIME` function, starting from the beginning of the `sale_date`'s year (`'start of year'`), and add the `quarter_start_month` number of months using a string modifier like `""+ 3 months""`.
3.  **`.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `sales_in_2023` data.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_group""`: Names the partition groups.
    *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start)`: Groups the data based on the unique combinations of the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   We select the `cust_state` and `quarter_start` (renamed to `customer_state` and `quarter_start_date` for clarity).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: We calculate the sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter group by accessing the original `Sales` collection context within the `SUM` aggregation.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(...)`**: The final result is ordered first by customer state alphabetically and then by the quarter start date chronologically.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_march_snapshot_in_inventory = inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)`**: This defines a filter condition applied to the `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection accessible from each `Car`.
    *   `YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023` and `MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`: Filters snapshots to only include those taken in March 2023.
    *   `is_in_inventory == True`: Filters snapshots where the car was marked as being in inventory.
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`: This is a window function that ranks the snapshots for *each car* (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first). By filtering for `== 1`, we select only the single latest snapshot *within March 2023* for that specific car.
2.  **`result = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This starts with the main `Cars` collection.
    *   `HAS(latest_march_snapshot_in_inventory) == 1`: This filters the `Cars` collection, keeping only those cars for which at least one snapshot exists that satisfies *all* the conditions defined in `latest_march_snapshot_in_inventory`. In essence, it selects cars that were marked as 'in inventory' in their latest snapshot taken during March 2023.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`**: Filters the `Treatments` collection to include only those records where the `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as required by the DDD definition for calculating duration.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days = DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: Calculates the duration of each treatment in days by finding the difference between `start_dt` and `end_dt`.
3.  **`.WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`**: Filters out treatments where the calculated duration is zero or negative, preventing division by zero errors and ensuring only valid durations are used for DDD calculation.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(ddd_value = tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days)`**: Calculates the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each remaining valid treatment by dividing the `tot_drug_amt` by the `treatment_duration_days`.

result = monthly_patient_counts
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the start date of the current month and the start dates of the three preceding months using `DATETIME` functions. This defines our time window.
2.  **`treatments_in_period`**: We access the `Treatments` collection via `time_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates). We filter treatments whose `start_dt` falls between the start of the 3rd previous month (inclusive) and the start of the current month (exclusive).
3.  **`CALCULATE` within `treatments_in_period`**:
    *   `treatment_month`: We create a 'YYYY-MM' formatted string for each treatment's start date to use as a partition key. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., '2023-07').
    *   `patient_key`: We explicitly bring the `patient_id` into the calculation context, renaming it to `patient_key` for clarity in distinct counting.
    *   `is_biologic`: We create a boolean flag indicating if the treatment's associated drug has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
4.  **`PARTITION`**: We partition the filtered treatments (`treatments_in_period`) by the `treatment_month`, grouping all treatments from the same month together. The partition group is named `monthly_data`.
5.  **`CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`**: For each month's partition (`monthly_data`):
    *   `month`: We select the `treatment_month` key.
    *   `patient_count`: We count the number of distinct `patient_key` values within that month's partition using `NDISTINCT`.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: We count the number of distinct `patient_key` values *only* for those records where the `is_biologic` flag is true, using `NDISTINCT` combined with `KEEP_IF`.
6.  **`ORDER_BY`**: The final results are ordered by month in ascending order.
7.  **`result`**: The final collection containing the month, total distinct patient count, and distinct biologic patient count for each of the last three full months is assigned to the `result` variable.",26.90068316459656,"# Calculate the start dates for the relevant time window

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_patients` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"") | ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"")` checks if the `email` field ends with ""@gmail.com"".
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")` checks if the `email` field ends with ""@yahoo.com"".
    *   The `|` operator acts as a logical OR, so the condition is true if the email ends with *either* ""@gmail.com"" *or* ""@yahoo.com"".
5.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of `Patients` records that satisfy the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Patients` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `treatments_received`: We access the list of treatments associated with each patient.
    *   `.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'Biologic'))`: Within the `treatments_received` for a patient, we further filter these treatments to find only those where the linked `diagnosis` has a `diag_name` of 'Psoriasis vulgaris' AND the linked `drug` has a `drug_type` of 'Biologic'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the inner `WHERE` clause returned at least one matching treatment for the current patient. If a patient has one or more treatments meeting both criteria, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1), and the patient is included in `filtered_patients`.
3.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(distinct_patient_count=COUNT(filtered_patients))`**:
    *   We use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection's `CALCULATE` method to produce a single result row.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_patients)`: We count the number of records in the `filtered_patients` collection. Since `filtered_patients` contains each matching patient only once, this count represents the distinct number of patients meeting the criteria.

    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the date range at the top `DermTreatment` level.
    *   `start_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This determines the beginning of the time window. It takes the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncates it to the start of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracts 6 months (`'-6 months'`).
    *   `end_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This determines the end of the time window (exclusive). It takes the current timestamp and truncates it to the start of the current month.
2.  **`result = date_boundaries.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform the final calculation, leveraging the pre-calculated `start_period` and `end_period`.
3.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of records that meet the specified criteria.
4.  **`Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`**: We filter the `Patients` collection to find patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
5.  **`.treatments_received`**: We access the treatments associated with the filtered patients (""Alice"").

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctor_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it calculates:
    *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
    *   `speciality`: The doctor's specialty.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs`: The count of unique drug IDs associated with the treatments prescribed by the doctor. This is achieved by navigating `prescribed_treatments` -> `drug` -> `drug_id` and applying the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function.

2.  **`specialty_groups = doctor_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the results from the previous step based on the `speciality` field. Each partition (named `spec_group`) contains doctors belonging to the same specialty. This grouping is necessary to perform ranking *within* each specialty.

3.  **`ranked_doctors_by_specialty = specialty_groups.doctor_drug_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data.
    *   `specialty_groups.doctor_drug_counts`: Accesses the individual doctor records within each specialty partition (using the name of the collection that was partitioned, `doctor_drug_counts`).
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each doctor within their specialty group, it calculates:
        *   `doc_id`, `speciality`, `num_distinct_drugs`: These fields are carried over from the pre-partition calculation.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""spec_group"")`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `num_distinct_drugs` field in descending order (higher count gets rank 1).
            *   `per=""spec_group""`: Crucially, this ensures the ranking is performed independently *within* each specialty partition created in the previous step.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Boundaries**: We define `start_current_month` and `start_12_months_ago` using the `DATETIME` function to establish the 12-month window preceding the current month.
2.  **Prepare Data**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and use `CALCULATE` to extract the `treatment_year` and `treatment_month_num` from the `start_dt`, and also retrieve the `patient_id` from the related `patient` record.
3.  **Filter**: The `WHERE` clause filters these treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls between `start_12_months_ago` (inclusive) and `start_current_month` (exclusive).
4.  **Partition**: We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered treatments by `treatment_year` and `treatment_month_num`, creating monthly buckets named ""months"".
5.  **Calculate Metrics**: Within each monthly partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   We reconstruct the `treatment_month_str` in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD`.
    *   `PMPD` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses) is calculated by counting the distinct `patient_id` values within the `Treatments` of that month's partition using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`.
    *   `PMTC` (Per Month Treatment Count) is calculated by counting all `Treatments` within that month's partition using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
6.  **Order and Select**: Finally, we use `ORDER_BY` to sort the results chronologically and `CALCULATE` to select the final desired columns: `treatment_month`, `PMPD`, and `PMTC`.",28.124530792236328,"# Define the date boundaries: start of the current month and start of 12 months prior

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_year`**: This variable identifies the year each patient received their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)` filters out patients who have never received any treatment.
    *   `CALCULATE(first_treatment_year=YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))` calculates the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` among all treatments for each patient and extracts the `YEAR` from that date, storing it as `first_treatment_year`.

2.  **`yearly_new_patients`**: This variable groups the patients by their `first_treatment_year` and counts how many fall into each year.
    *   It takes the `patient_first_treatment_year` data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year)` groups the records based on the `first_treatment_year`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then operates on each group (each year):
        *   `year=first_treatment_year` selects the year for the group.
        *   `n_new_patients=COUNT(patient_first_treatment_year)` counts how many patients belong to that specific `first_treatment_year` group.

3.  **`result`**: This final step calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI) and formats the output.
    *   It takes the `yearly_new_patients` data (which has year and count of new patients).
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` computes the final fields:
        *   `year=year` keeps the year.
        *   `n_new_patients=n_new_patients` keeps the count of new patients for that year.
        *   `npi=n_new_patients - PREV(n_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)` calculates the NPI. `PREV(n_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)` retrieves the `n_new_patients` value from the *previous* record when ordered by year. Subtracting this from the current year's `n_new_patients` gives the increase. `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the data (where there's no previous year), the NPI is calculated as `n_new_patients - 0`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`avg_scores = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This starts at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to calculate overall averages.
2.  **`avg_d7_pasi = AVG(Outcomes.WHERE(...).day7_pasi_score)`**: This calculates the average `day7_pasi_score`. It first accesses the `Outcomes` collection and filters it using `WHERE` to include only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null (`!= None`). Then, `AVG()` computes the average of the `day7_pasi_score` for these filtered records.
3.  **`avg_d100_pasi = AVG(Outcomes.WHERE(...).day100_pasi_score)`**: Similarly, this calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` using the same filtering logic to ensure only records with both scores present are considered.
4.  **`result = avg_scores.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the previously calculated averages (`avg_d7_pasi` and `avg_d100_pasi`) from the `avg_scores` intermediate result.
5.  **`d7d100pir_percentage = (avg_d100_pasi - avg_d7_pasi) / avg_d7_pasi * 100.0`**: This applies the provided formula for D7D100PIR using the calculated averages. It subtracts the average day 7 score from the average day 100 score, divides by the average day 7 score, and multiplies by 100.0 (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division) to get the final percentage value. The result is assigned to the `d7d100pir_percentage` field.",18.78277850151062,"# Calculate average PASI scores only for outcomes with non-null values at both day 7 and day 100

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`PIC=COUNT(...)`**: We define the output field `PIC` (Private Insured patient Count) using the `COUNT` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `COUNT`, we specify the collection to count from, which is `Patients`. We filter this collection using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'F') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: This is the filtering condition. It selects patients where the `gender` field is equal to 'F' AND the `ins_type` field is equal to 'Private'.
5.  The `COUNT` function then counts the number of patients remaining after applying the filter, and this count is assigned to the `PIC` field in the final result.",9.467024326324465,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_outcomes`**: We start with the `Outcomes` collection. We filter it to include only records where the associated `treatment` ended in the year 2022 (`YEAR(treatment.end_dt) == 2022`), ensure the link to the treatment exists (`HAS(treatment) == 1`), and importantly, where the `day100_pasi_score` is not null, as null values would interfere with the `AVG` calculation. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the patient's `ins_type` (navigating through `treatment` and `patient`), the `patient_id`, and the `day100_pasi_score`, renaming them for clarity.
2.  **`insurance_groups`**: We partition the `relevant_outcomes` data using the `insurance_type` as the key. This groups all the outcome records belonging to the same insurance type together.
3.  **`insurance_summary`**: For each partition group (each insurance type), we calculate the required aggregates:
    *   `ins_type`: We retain the insurance type (the partition key).
    *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: We calculate the average of the `pasi_100` values (which we calculated in the first step) within each insurance group using `AVG(ins_groups.pasi_100)`.
    *   `num_distinct_patients`: We count the number of unique patients within each insurance group using `NDISTINCT(ins_groups.patient_identifier)`.
4.  **`top_ins_types_by_pasi`**: Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_d100.ASC())` on the `insurance_summary` to select the 5 records with the lowest `avg_pasi_score_d100`. The `.ASC()` ensures sorting in ascending order (lowest score first).
5.  **`result = top_ins_types_by_pasi`**: The final result containing the top 5 insurance types, their average day 100 PASI score, and the distinct patient count is assigned to the `result` variable.",35.31663489341736,"# Step 1: Filter Outcomes for treatments ending in 2022 and having a day 100 PASI score.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Diagnoses.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Diagnoses` collection. For each diagnosis, we calculate three new fields:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Renames the `diag_name` field for clarity in the output.
    *   `max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: This navigates from each `Diagnosis` to its associated `Treatments` (via `treatments_for`), then to the `Outcomes` for those treatments (via `outcome_records`), and calculates the maximum value found in the `day100_itch_vas` field across all those outcomes. The `MAX` aggregation function handles the one-to-many relationships correctly.
    *   `num_patients=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`: This navigates from each `Diagnosis` to its `Treatments` (via `treatments_for`), then to the `Patient` associated with each treatment (via `patient`), and counts the number of distinct `patient_id` values encountered. This gives the unique count of patients treated for the diagnosis.
2.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))`**: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 3 records based on the `max_itch_score` field.
    *   `3`: Specifies that we want the top 3 records.
    *   `by=max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `max_itch_score` in descending order (highest score first). `na_pos='last'` ensures that any diagnoses for which a maximum score couldn't be calculated (e.g., no day 100 data) are placed at the bottom of the ranking and thus are unlikely to be included in the top 3.
3.  **`result = ...`**: The final result, containing the top 3 diagnoses with their names, patient counts, and maximum day 100 itch scores, is assigned to the `result` variable.",25.55966019630432,"# Calculate max day 100 itch score and distinct patient count for each diagnosis

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_cutoff = DATETIME('now', '-6 months', 'start of month')`**: Defines the start date for our time window. It takes the current time (`'now'`), subtracts 6 months (`'-6 months'`), and then finds the beginning of that resulting month (`'start of month'`) to accurately capture the last 6 *calendar* months.
2.  **`recent_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(start_dt >= start_date_cutoff)`**: Filters the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `start_date_cutoff`.
3.  **`treatments_info = recent_treatments.CALCULATE(...)`**: Takes the filtered treatments and calculates two new fields for each: `specialty` (by accessing the related `doctor`'s specialty) and `drug_amount` (renaming `tot_drug_amt` for clarity).
4.  **`specialty_groups = treatments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: Groups the `treatments_info` records based on the unique values in the `specialty` field. Each group is named `spec_groups`.
5.  **`specialty_stats = specialty_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: Operates on each group created by the partition. For each `specialty`:
    *   `doc_specialty = specialty`: Selects the specialty (the partition key).
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(spec_groups)`: Counts the number of treatment records within that specialty's group.
    *   `total_drug_prescribed = SUM(spec_groups.drug_amount)`: Sums the `drug_amount` for all treatments within that specialty's group.
6.  **`top_specialties = specialty_stats.TOP_K(...)`**: Sorts the `specialty_stats` results in descending order based on `total_drug_prescribed` and selects the top 3 records.

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: Starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection and applying filters.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: Filters treatments where the associated `diagnosis` has a `diag_name`. It converts the name to lowercase using `LOWER()` and then uses `LIKE` with wildcards (`%`) to find names containing ""psoriasis"" case-insensitively.
3.  **`drug.fda_appr_dt <= DATETIME('now')`**: Filters treatments where the associated `drug` has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`) that is on or before the current date/time. This implies the drug has been approved.
4.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: Filters treatments where the `end_dt` (end date) is after the date 6 months prior to the current date/time (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and on or before the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`). This selects treatments ending within the last 6 months.
5.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines these conditions, so a treatment must satisfy all of them.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as it contains the core information about adverse events (date and description) and links to the treatment.
2.  **`WHERE(...)`**: This filters the adverse events based on their timing relative to the treatment start date.
    *   **`treatment.start_dt`**: Accesses the start date of the treatment associated with the adverse event via the `treatment` relationship.
    *   **`reported_dt`**: The date the adverse event was reported (from the `AdverseEvents` record itself).
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)`**: Calculates the difference in days between the treatment start date and the adverse event reported date.
    *   **`(DATEDIFF(...) > 0)`**: Ensures the adverse event occurred *after* the treatment started (difference is positive).
    *   **`(DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: Ensures the adverse event occurred within 10 days of the start date (difference is 10 or less).
    *   **`&`**: Combines both conditions, so only events occurring 1 to 10 days after the treatment start are included.
3.  **`CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and formats the final output fields for each matching adverse event.
    *   **`treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`**: Selects the `treatment_id` from the related `treatment` record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need a single aggregate value (the average age) for a subset of all patients.
2.  **`AVG(...)`**: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == 'M') & (ins_type == 'Private'))`**: This filters the `Patients` collection to include only those records where the `gender` is 'M' (male) AND the `ins_type` is 'Private'.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_age_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`**: For each patient remaining after the filter, this calculates their current age in full years.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`), returning the number of full years elapsed.
    *   This calculated age is stored temporarily as `patient_age_years`.
5.  **`.patient_age_years`**: This accesses the `patient_age_years` calculated in the previous step, providing these individual age values to the `AVG` function.
6.  **`ROUND(..., 0)`**: The result of the `AVG` function might be a decimal number. This function rounds the calculated average age to the nearest whole number (0 decimal places), fulfilling the requirement for the age in integer years.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_stats = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name`: The name of the merchant.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used`: We access the transactions received by the merchant (`transactions_received`). We filter these transactions to include only those where the `status` is 'completed' and where a coupon was actually associated (`HAS(coupon) == 1`). Then, we count the number of distinct coupon IDs (`NDISTINCT(...coupon.cid)`) among these filtered transactions.
    *   `distinct_successful_transactions`: We again access the transactions received (`transactions_received`), filter them for `status == 'completed'`, and count the number of distinct transaction IDs (`NDISTINCT(...txid)`).

2.  **`merchant_cpur = merchant_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the results from the previous step. This is necessary because fields calculated in one `CALCULATE` (`distinct_coupons_used`, `distinct_successful_transactions`) can only be used in subsequent operations.
    *   `merchant_name`: We carry over the merchant's name.
    *   `cpur`: We calculate the Coupon Usage Rate (CPUR). We use the `IFF` function to handle cases where a merchant might have zero successful transactions (`distinct_successful_transactions > 0`). If they have successful transactions, we divide `distinct_coupons_used` by `distinct_successful_transactions`. Otherwise (if they have 0 successful transactions), we assign a CPUR of `0.0`.

3.  **`result = merchant_cpur`**: The final result, containing the merchant name and their calculated CPUR, is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.98838233947754,"# Calculate the number of distinct coupons used and distinct successful transactions per merchant

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Period:** We first define the `start_period` (start of the week, 3 weeks ago) and `end_period` (start of the current week) using the `DATETIME` function with appropriate modifiers.
2.  **Filter Notifications:** We start with the `Notifications` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `created_at >= start_period`: Ensures notifications are within the last 3 weeks.
    *   `created_at < end_period`: Excludes notifications from the current week.
    *   `ISIN(user.country, (""US"", ""Canada""))`: Filters for notifications sent to users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Calculate Week and Weekend Flag:** In the subsequent `CALCULATE` step:
    *   `notification_week_start = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`: We truncate the `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_flag = IFF(ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")), 1, 0)`: We determine if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`. The `IFF` function creates a flag, setting it to `1` if it's a weekend day and `0` otherwise. This numeric flag allows us to easily sum up weekend notifications later.
4.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` to group the `notification_info` records based on the `notification_week_start`. Each partition (`weeks`) represents a specific week within our time frame.
5.  **Aggregate Counts:** In the final `CALCULATE` applied to the `weekly_groups`:
    *   `week_start_date = notification_week_start`: We select the week's start date (which was the partition key).
    *   `total_notifications = COUNT(Notifications)`: We count all the original `Notifications` records that fall into this specific weekly partition.
    *   `weekend_notifications = SUM(Notifications.is_weekend_flag)`: We sum the `is_weekend_flag` (which is 1 for weekend days, 0 otherwise) for all notifications within this weekly partition. This effectively counts how many notifications in that week were sent on a weekend.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection and applies filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `(sending_user.country == ""US"")`: Filters transactions where the `country` of the `sending_user` is ""US"".
    *   `(transaction_type == ""wallet"")`: Filters transactions where the `transaction_type` is exactly ""wallet"".
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 6)`: Filters transactions where the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date (`'now'`) is 6 days or less. This effectively selects transactions from today and the preceding 6 days, covering the requested ""last 7 days inclusive"".
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so a transaction must meet all three criteria.
2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs the final aggregation at the top level of the graph (`Ewallet`).
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions present in the `filtered_transactions` collection.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all transactions within the `filtered_transactions` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_updates = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, 'now') <= 7)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days (inclusive) compared to the current time ('now').
2.  **`user_ambs = recent_updates.PARTITION(name=""user_groups"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(...)`**: This partitions the `recent_updates` by `user_id`. For each unique `user_id` group:
    *   `user_id=user_id`: Selects the user ID.
    *   `user_avg_balance=AVG(UserBalances.balance)`: Calculates the average balance for all records belonging to that specific user within the 7-day window. This represents the Average Balance (AMB) for that user during the period.
3.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(average_amb=AVG(user_ambs.user_avg_balance))`**: This takes the `user_ambs` collection (which contains one row per user with their calculated `user_avg_balance`) and calculates the overall average of the `user_avg_balance` column.

    user_id = user_id,

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ranked_balances = UserBalances.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `UserBalances` collection. Inside `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Retrieve the `user_id` by accessing the linked `user` record (`user.uid`).
    *   Keep the `balance` and `updated_at` fields.
    *   Calculate `balance_rank` using the `RANKING` window function.
        *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks the balances in descending order of their update timestamp (most recent first).
        *   `per=""user""`: Ensures the ranking is performed independently for each unique user associated with the balance records. The latest balance for each user will get rank 1.
2.  **`latest_user_balances = ranked_balances.WHERE(balance_rank == 1).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We filter the `ranked_balances` to keep only the rows where `balance_rank` is 1 (the most recent balance for each user).
    *   Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select the `user_id` and the corresponding `balance`, renaming `balance` to `latest_user_balance` as per the definition of LUB (Latest User Balance).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to determine the latest setting snapshot for each user.
2.  **`latest_snapshot=setting_snapshots.WHERE(...)`**: For each user, we access their `setting_snapshots`.
3.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: Ranks the snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first).
    *   `per=""Users""`: Specifies that the ranking should be performed independently for each user (within the context of the `Users` collection).
    *   `== 1`: Filters to keep only the snapshot with rank 1 (the latest one).

3.  **`transactions_with_month`**: Creates a new field `year_month_key` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `created_at` timestamp. This key is used for grouping transactions by month.
4.  **`monthly_active_users`**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(year_month_key))`: Groups the filtered transactions based on the `year_month_key`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection because we want to calculate a result for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and name it `user_id` in the output.
3.  **`total_duration_seconds=SUM(...)`**: We calculate the total session duration for each user and name it `total_duration_seconds`. The `SUM` function aggregates the values calculated within its parentheses.
4.  **`sessions.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `SUM`, we access the `sessions` sub-collection for each user and filter them using `WHERE`. The filter keeps only sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01"" and strictly before ""2023-06-08"".
5.  **`.CALCULATE(duration=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`**: For each session that passes the date filter, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` and temporarily name this duration `duration`.
6.  **`.duration`**: We select the calculated `duration` from the inner `CALCULATE` so that the `SUM` function can aggregate these individual session durations.
7.  **`).WHERE(total_duration_seconds > 0)`**: After calculating the total duration, we filter out users whose total duration is zero or null, ensuring only users with actual session time in the period are included.
8.  **`).ORDER_BY(total_duration_seconds.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting collection of users and their total durations in descending order based on `total_duration_seconds`, placing users with the longest session times first.
9.  **`result = user_session_durations`**: The final query is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.448687076568604,"# Calculate total session duration for each user within the specified date range.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window:**
    *   `start_of_current_month` is calculated using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_of_previous_month` is calculated by subtracting one month from `start_of_current_month` using `DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-1 month')`.
2.  **Filter Transactions:**
    *   `prev_month_transactions` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those records where the `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to the start of the previous month and less than the start of the current month).
3.  **Count Transactions:**
    *   `total_tx_count` counts all transactions found within the `prev_month_transactions` filter.
    *   `successful_tx_count` counts only the transactions within `prev_month_transactions` where the `status` is 'completed'. We assume 'completed' signifies a successful transaction.
4.  **Calculate STR:**
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on the top-level `Ewallet` collection to produce a single result.
    *   It calculates `str_for_previous_month` using the formula: `100.0 * successful_tx_count / total_tx_count`.
    *   The `IFF` function is used to prevent division by zero. If `total_tx_count` is greater than 0, the STR is calculated; otherwise, it defaults to `0.0`.",15.984158992767334,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the previous month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_transactions`**: This step filters the `Transactions` collection. It keeps only transactions that meet all the specified criteria:
    *   Occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   Have a status of 'completed' (`status == 'completed'`).
    *   Were sent by a 'user' (`sender_type == 'user'`).
    *   Have a valid link to the sending user (`HAS(sending_user) == 1`).
    *   The linked sending user has a status of 'active' (`sending_user.status == 'active'`).
2.  **`transaction_info`**: This step takes the filtered transactions and calculates two new fields for each:
    *   `transaction_month_start`: Uses the `DATETIME` function to truncate the `created_at` timestamp to the first day of its month. This standardizes the date for grouping.
    *   `sender_user_id`: Extracts the unique identifier (`uid`) of the user who sent the transaction via the `sending_user` relationship.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: This step partitions the `transaction_info` data. It groups the records based on the `transaction_month_start` field. All transactions from the same month (e.g., 2023-01-01, 2023-02-01) will be placed into the same partition group.
4.  **`monthly_active_user_counts`**: This step operates on each partition created by `monthly_groups`. For each month's group, it calculates:
    *   `month_date`: Selects the `transaction_month_start` value (which is the same for all records within the partition).
    *   `num_active_users`: Uses the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function on the `sender_user_id` field (referencing back to the `transaction_info` context within the partition) to count the number of unique users who sent at least one transaction in that specific month.
5.  **`result`**: This final step takes the monthly counts and orders them by the `month_date` in ascending order, ensuring the output starts with the earliest month in 2023 and proceeds chronologically.",28.91299271583557,"# Filter transactions to include only those from 2023, with 'completed' status,

**Explanation:**

1.  **`snapshots_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only those records where the year of the `snapshot_date` is 2023.
2.  **`earliest_snapshots = snapshots_2023.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC()) == 1)`**: This line further filters the `snapshots_2023` collection. It uses the `RANKING` window function to rank the snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in ascending order (earliest first). By filtering `WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)`, it selects only the snapshot(s) that occurred on the very first day snapshots were recorded in 2023.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`coupons_ranked_by_start = Merchants.coupons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by accessing all coupons through their merchants (`Merchants.coupons`). Inside `CALCULATE`, we bring down the merchant's `mid` and `created_at` date, keep the coupon's `cid` and `start_date`, and crucially, calculate the `earliest_rank` for each coupon. `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns rank 1 to the coupon with the earliest `start_date` for each distinct merchant.
2.  **`earliest_coupons = coupons_ranked_by_start.WHERE(earliest_rank == 1)`**: We filter the ranked coupons to keep only those with `earliest_rank` equal to 1, effectively selecting the single earliest coupon for each merchant.
3.  **`qualifying_merchants_coupons = earliest_coupons.WHERE(...)`**: We apply the main condition here. We filter the `earliest_coupons` collection, keeping only those where the difference in days between the merchant's creation date (`m_created_at`) and the coupon's start date (`c_start_date`) is less than or equal to 365, using the `DATEDIFF` function.

    *   `HASNOT(...) == 1`: This checks if the filtered list of notifications (those received within the first year) is empty. The condition `== 1` means we are looking for users where this check is true (i.e., they have *no* notifications within the first year).
3.  **`result = users_without_first_year_notification.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, for the users who met the filter criteria (no notifications in the first year), we select and rename the required fields: `username`, `email`, and the original `created_at` date, aliased as `signup_date`.",18.122130393981934,"import datetime
