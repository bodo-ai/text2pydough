1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. This is done by checking `COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5`.
3.  For the filtered customers, calculate their success rate. We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is ""Completed"". The success rate is calculated as: `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`.
4.  Select the customer's name and their calculated success rate.
5.  Order the results by the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers, keeping only those for whom the count of their `transactions_made` (i.e., total transactions) is greater than or equal to 5.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   For each customer passing the filter, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: This selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0`:
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: This counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be the count of successful transactions.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: This counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The division of these two counts gives the ratio of successful transactions to total transactions.
            *   Multiplying by `100.0` converts this ratio to a percentage.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate`) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`.ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.",25.07821559906006,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in conjunction with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol`.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering and then counting records from the `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, obtained by using `Broker.CALCULATE`.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols for clarity
faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple of FAANG stock ticker symbols. This is a contextless expression used for better readability in the query.
2.  `com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`: This condition checks if the customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that involves a FAANG stock.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: This filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through `transactions_made.ticker.symbol`) is present in the `faang_tickers` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function returns true if the preceding filtered sub-collection (`transactions_made` for FAANG stocks) is not empty for the customer.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so a customer must satisfy both to be included.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_of_customers = COUNT(com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result. It uses the `Broker` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries`: We first establish the time frame. `current_week_start_date` marks the beginning of the current week. `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` marks the beginning of the week that started 8 weeks before the current week (e.g., if current week is W, this is start of W-8).
2.  `processed_transactions`:
    *   We start with `Broker.Transactions`.
    *   `WHERE(ticker.ticker_type == 'STOCK')`: Filters transactions to include only those where the associated ticker is of type 'STOCK'. You may need to adjust 'STOCK' if the actual `ticker_type` value for stocks is different.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `transaction_week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: For each transaction, this calculates the date of the Monday (or configured start of week) of the week it occurred in.
        *   `is_weekend_transaction = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean field that is `True` if the transaction date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.
3.  `transactions_in_period`: This filters `processed_transactions` to include only those whose `transaction_week_start` is on or after `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` and before `current_week_start_date`. This effectively selects transactions from the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_stock_summary`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the `transactions_in_period` by the `transaction_week_start`. Each group represents one week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_start_display = transaction_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for display.
        *   `total_stock_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction` boolean values. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in a sum, this counts transactions that occurred on a weekend.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start_display.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the week start date.
5.  `result = weekly_stock_summary`: Assigns the final computed table to `result`.

""Last week"" is defined as the 7-day period starting from `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` up to, but not including, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions_last_week_usa)`: Counts the number of records in the `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa` collection.

3.  Then, using these calculated values, rank each customer based on their total transaction amount in descending order. The customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1. This is achieved using the `RANKING` window function.
4.  Finally, select the customer's name, their calculated number of transactions, total transaction amount, and their rank (CR).

This requires two `CALCULATE` steps because a field defined in a `CALCULATE` clause (like `total_transaction_amount`) can only be referenced by subsequent operations like `RANKING` after that `CALCULATE` step is complete.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate initial aggregations for each customer: name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount.
customer_aggregates = Customers.CALCULATE(
    c_name=name,
    num_trans=COUNT(transactions_made),
    total_trans_amount_val=SUM(transactions_made.amount)

    number_of_transactions=num_trans,
    total_transaction_amount=total_trans_amount_val,
    CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount_val.DESC())
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_aggregates = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_name=name`: Selects the customer's name and assigns it to `c_name`.
    *   `num_trans=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer from their `transactions_made` sub-collection and assigns it to `num_trans`.
    *   `total_trans_amount_val=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer and assigns it to `total_trans_amount_val`.

2.  `result = customer_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the intermediate results from `customer_aggregates`.
    *   `customer_name=c_name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `number_of_transactions=num_trans`: Selects the calculated number of transactions.
    *   `total_transaction_amount=total_trans_amount_val`: Selects the calculated total transaction amount.
    *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount_val.DESC())`: Calculates the rank for each customer.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: This is a window function that assigns a rank.
        *   `by=total_trans_amount_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the `total_trans_amount_val` field in descending order, so the customer with the highest total transaction amount gets rank 1. Since no `per` argument is specified, the ranking is global across all customers.

The final `result` will contain one record per customer with their name, total number of transactions, total transaction amount, and their rank (CR).",30.20118021965027,"# Step 1: Calculate initial aggregations for each customer: name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount.

1.  Start with the `Transactions` collection.
2.  For each transaction, extract the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction date/time (`date_time`), and the transaction type (`transaction_type`). We use `CALCULATE` for this.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those that:
    *   Are of type ""BUY"".
    *   Occurred within the last 10 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_dt, DATETIME('now')) <= 9`. This condition covers a 10-day window including the current day (e.g., if today is Day 10, this includes Day 1 through Day 10).
4.  Group the filtered transactions by the ticker symbol using `PARTITION`. The partition key will be the `ticker_s` (ticker symbol) calculated earlier.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), calculate the number of buy transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`. The output fields will be `ticker_symbol` and `num_buy_transactions`.
6.  Finally, use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order of count.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined 6-month window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month and Year**: For these filtered customers, we extract the year and month of their `join_date`.
4.  **Group by Signup Month/Year**: We partition the customers based on their signup year and month.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month-year group, we count the number of customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_boundary` and `six_months_ago_start_boundary` define the date range for customer signups. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gets the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` gets the first day of the month that was six months ago.
2.  `Customers.WHERE(...)` filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is within the last six full months (e.g., if today is July 15th, this includes customers who joined from January 1st up to, but not including, July 1st).
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))` extracts the year and month from the `join_date` for these customers.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_signup_cohorts"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))` groups these customers by the year and month they signed up.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the requested metrics for each group:
    *   `signup_month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", signup_year_val, LPAD(signup_month_val, 2, ""0""))`: Formats the signup year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January).
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers in each `monthly_signup_cohorts` group, giving the Per Month Customer Signups.
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: Calculates the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in each group. `Customers.transactions_made` accesses the related transactions. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, PMAT will be 0.0 instead of null.

The AR is defined as `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Here's how the PyDough code implements this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: It first selects customers who joined in 2022 using `Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`. For each of these customers, it creates a flag `is_active_flag` which is true (1) if the customer has made any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) and false (0) otherwise. This collection is named `filtered_customers`.

2.  **Group by Country and Aggregate**: The `filtered_customers` are then partitioned by their `country` using `PARTITION(name=""country_data"", by=(country))`. For each country group:
    *   `num_active_customers_in_country`: This is calculated by summing the `is_active_flag` for all customers in that country group (`SUM(filtered_customers.is_active_flag)`). This effectively counts customers who joined in 2022, belong to the specific country, and have transactions.
    *   `total_customers_in_country_cohort`: This is the total count of customers within that country group (`COUNT(filtered_customers)`), representing all customers who joined in 2022 and belong to that country.

3.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `activity_ratio_value`.
    *   The AR is `(num_active_customers_in_country * 100.0) / total_customers_in_country_cohort`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country_cohort` might be zero (i.e., no customers joined from that country in 2022) to prevent division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   This interpretation assumes that for the cohort ""customers who joined in 2022"", ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" refers to those in the cohort with transactions, and ""Total Number of Customers"" (in the denominator of the AR formula) refers to all customers in that cohort for the given country.

4.  **Format Final Result**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `country` and `AR` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly one month prior to the current moment. This will be used to filter transactions.
2.  `relevant_transactions_data = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time >= one_month_ago_date))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that are of `transaction_type` ""sell"" AND occurred on or after `one_month_ago_date`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate:
        *   `ticker_symbol_val = ticker.symbol`: Extracts the stock symbol associated with the transaction.
        *   `current_transaction_amount = amount`: Takes the transaction amount.
        *   `current_transaction_costs = tax + commission`: Calculates the sum of tax and commission for the transaction.
3.  `spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker = relevant_transactions_data.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the `relevant_transactions_data` by `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `name=""transactions_for_ticker""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(ticker_symbol_val)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol_output = ticker_symbol_val`: Carries over the ticker symbol.
        *   `total_sells_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_amount)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_amount` values for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
        *   `total_costs_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_costs)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_costs` for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
4.  `result = spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the SPM for each ticker.
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_output`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `SPM = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin.
        *   `IFF(total_sells_for_ticker == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This checks if `total_sells_for_ticker` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   `(total_sells_for_ticker - total_costs_for_ticker) / total_sells_for_ticker * 100.0`: If `total_sells_for_ticker` is not zero, this calculates the SPM according to the provided formula. The `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

The final `result` will contain a list of records, each with a `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding `SPM` for sell transactions in the past month.",52.6740140914917,"# Define the start date for ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago""

1.  **Prepare Daily Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, calculate the ticker symbol (from the related `ticker` object), the year, and the month of the transaction. Also, keep the daily close, high, and low prices.
2.  **Group and Aggregate Monthly**:
    *   First, partition the prepared daily data by `ticker_symbol_field`. This creates groups for each unique ticker.
    *   Then, within each ticker group, partition by `year_field` and `month_field`. This creates subgroups for each month within each ticker.
    *   For each ticker-month subgroup, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price using the daily values. This results in a collection where each row represents a ticker's performance for a specific month.
3.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: On this monthly aggregated data:
    *   Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the *previous* month for the *same ticker*.
    *   The `PREV` function will operate `per=""ticker_level_group""` (the name of the partition by ticker) and will be ordered by year and month number to correctly identify the preceding month.
    *   If a month is the first one for a ticker, there's no previous month, so `PREV` will return a default value (e.g., `None`).
4.  **Calculate MoMC and Format Output**:
    *   With the current month's average close and the previous month's average close, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where the previous month's average close is `None` or zero to avoid errors.
    *   Format the month as 'YYYY-MM'.
    *   Select the required fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by ticker symbol alphabetically and then by month chronologically.

2.  For each daily price record, calculate necessary fields:
    *   `stock_sym_calc`: The ticker symbol, accessed from the related `ticker` object (`ticker.symbol`).
    *   `price_dt_calc`: The date of the price record.
    *   `h_price_calc`: The high price for that day.
    *   `l_price_calc`: The low price for that day.
3.  Filter these records to include only those within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"".
4.  Partition the filtered data by `stock_sym_calc`. This groups all price records for the same stock together.
5.  For each stock group (partition):
    *   Calculate `overall_max_h`: The maximum `h_price_calc` (highest high price) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   Calculate `overall_min_l`: The minimum `l_price_calc` (lowest low price) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   The `ticker_symbol_output` will be the `stock_sym_calc` for that group.
6.  Calculate `price_change_output` as `overall_max_h - overall_min_l` for each stock.
7.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_output.DESC())` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest price change in descending order.
8.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `ticker_symbol` and `price_change` for the output.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate a new field, let's call it `num_transactions_in_join_month`. This calculation involves:
    *   Accessing the customer's `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   Filtering these transactions to keep only those where the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the `date_time` field match the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the customer's `join_date`.
    *   Counting the number of such filtered transactions using `COUNT()`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K(1, by=...)` method to select the single customer who has the highest value for `num_transactions_in_join_month`. The sorting is done in descending order.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select the customer's `_id`, `name`, and the calculated count, renaming the count field to `number_of_transactions` for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates the process by iterating through each customer.
    *   `num_transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: For each customer, this calculates the number of transactions they made in the same month and year they joined.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It accesses the list of transactions for the current customer and filters them.
        *   `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions occurring in the same calendar month and year as the customer's `join_date` are considered. `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions extract the respective parts from the date fields.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the transactions that satisfy the condition.
    The result of this step is a collection of customers, each with their original fields plus the new `num_transactions_in_join_month` field.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This takes the collection from the previous step and selects the top 1 customer.
    *   `by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC()`: The selection is based on the `num_transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order, so the customer with the highest count is chosen.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, name=name, number_of_transactions=num_transactions_in_join_month)`: This final step formats the output.
    *   It selects the `_id` and `name` (original fields from the `Customers` collection that were carried through).

*   `.TOP_K(5, by=total_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This method selects the top 5 records from the result of the preceding `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_transactions_info`: This variable stores transactions from the last 30 days.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 30)`: Filters transactions to include only those where the difference in days between the `date_time` of the transaction and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. This effectively selects transactions from the past 30 days, inclusive of 30 days ago.
    *   `.CALCULATE(country_of_customer = customer.country, current_transaction_amount = amount)`: For each filtered transaction, it extracts the customer's country (aliased as `country_of_customer`) and the transaction amount (aliased as `current_transaction_amount`).

2.  `country_summary_metrics`: This variable groups the `recent_transactions_info` by country and calculates aggregates.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""transactions_by_country"", by=(country_of_customer))`: Groups the transactions based on the `country_of_customer` field. Each group represents a unique country.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each country group:
        *   `country_name = country_of_customer`: Selects the country name.
        *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(recent_transactions_info)`: Counts the number of transactions within that country group.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(recent_transactions_info.current_transaction_amount)`: Sums the `current_transaction_amount` for all transactions within that country group.

3.  `result`: This variable holds the final output.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter DailyPrices for 'VTI' and for the last 7 calendar days (today + 6 previous days)
vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (ticker.symbol == 'VTI') &
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) &  # Ensures date is not in the future

)

# Calculate the lowest closing price from the filtered data
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    lowest_vti_close_price_past_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.
        *   `<= 6` ensures the date is within the 6 days prior to today, or is today itself (0 days difference). This covers a total of 7 distinct calendar days.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final result at the top `Broker` level.
    *   `lowest_vti_close_price_past_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`: It computes the minimum value of the `close` field from the `vti_prices_last_7_days` collection.

2.  **`Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70)`**:
    *   This part filters the `Customers` collection.

What is the monthly average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023?,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-01', sbTxDateTime) AS datetime, AVG(sbTxPrice) AS avg_price FROM sbTransaction WHERE sbTxStatus = 'success' AND sbTxDateTime BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31' GROUP BY datetime ORDER BY datetime;",Broker,"To determine the monthly average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in January, February, or March of 2023 and had a status of ""successful"".
2.  Extract the month from the `date_time` of these filtered transactions.
3.  Group these transactions by the extracted month.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction `price`.
5.  The final result will show each month of Q1 2023 and its corresponding average transaction price.

```python
# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 that were successful
# and extract the month number.

    (status == ""successful"") &
    (YEAR(date_time) == 2023) &

result = monthly_average_transaction_prices
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures we only consider transactions that were completed successfully.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitute the first quarter.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month_number = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, we create a new field `transaction_month_number` which stores the month of each transaction. The original `price` field from `Transactions` is implicitly available for later aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month_number))`: We then partition the filtered and augmented transactions into groups based on the `transaction_month_number`. Each group will contain all successful transactions for a specific month in Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month_number, average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each partition (i.e., for each month):
    *   `month = transaction_month_number`: We select the month number for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: We calculate the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` of the transactions belonging to the current partition.
5.  `result = monthly_average_transaction_prices`: The final result contains each month of Q1 2023 (as a number 1, 2, or 3) and the calculated average transaction price for successful transactions within that month.",33.39949345588684,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 that were successful

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: Calculate the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week analysis period (which is 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week). This is done at the `Dealership` (top-level graph) scope.
2.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales records where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000. These calculations will have access to the date boundaries defined in step 1.
3.  **Access Payments**: For these filtered sales, access their associated `payment` records.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: Keep only those payments that fall within the 8-week analysis period. The period is from `analysis_period_start_dt` (inclusive) up to `current_week_start_dt` (exclusive).
5.  **Augment Payment Data**: For each payment in the analysis window:
    *   Calculate the start date of the week in which the payment occurred (`payment_week_start_date_attr`). This will serve as our weekly grouping key.
    *   Create a flag (`is_weekend_payment_attr`) which is 1 if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, and 0 otherwise.
6.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the augmented payment data by `payment_week_start_date_attr`. For each week:
    *   Output the week start date as `week`.
    *   Count the total number of payments (`total_payments_received`).
    *   Sum the `is_weekend_payment_attr` flag to get the count of weekend payments (`weekend_payments_received`).

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to include only those cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. We'll use `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards for a case-insensitive partial match as requested.
2.  Partition the filtered cars by their `make` and `model`. This will group cars of the same make and model together.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars), calculate:
    *   The `make` of the car.
    *   The `model` of the car.
    *   The total number of sales, which is achieved by counting all `sale_records` associated with the cars in that group.

```python
# Filter cars that have 'M5' in their VIN number (case-insensitive partial match)

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%')` checks if the lowercase version of `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. The `%` are wildcards, meaning 'm5' can appear anywhere in the VIN. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' in the VIN.

2.  `sales_count_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `cars_with_m5_vin` (cars that matched the VIN criteria).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars. Each group will consist of cars having the same `make` and `model`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with all cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` of the cars within the partition group.

3.  Further filter these sales to include only those that occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved by:

    *   Adding a condition `sale_date <= DATETIME('now')` to ensure that only past or current sales are considered, preventing any potential issues if `sale_date` could be in the future.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first creates a temporary collection `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days`. This collection contains records from the `Sales` table that satisfy three conditions:
1.  The `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
2.  The `sale_date` is within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. This is checked by ensuring that the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is 29 or less.
3.  The `sale_date` is not in the future, which is a safeguard.

Then, using the main `Dealership` collection, it calculates two aggregate values from this filtered set:
-   `number_of_sales`: The total count of sales records in `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days`.
-   `total_revenue`: The sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_summary = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   For each salesperson, we calculate:
        *   `s_first_name`: The salesperson's first name, aliased from `first_name`.
        *   `s_last_name`: The salesperson's last name, aliased from `last_name`.
        *   `s_total_sales`: The total sales amount, calculated by summing the `sale_price` from all their associated sales in the `sales_made` sub-collection (`SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`).
        *   `s_num_sales`: The total number of sales, calculated by counting the number of sales in the `sales_made` sub-collection (`COUNT(sales_made)`).
    *   These calculated fields are given temporary names prefixed with `s_` to be used in the next step.

2.  **`result = sales_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We take the `sales_summary` collection (which now includes the calculated total sales and number of sales for each salesperson).
    *   We perform another `CALCULATE` operation to:
        *   Select `first_name` (from `s_first_name`).
        *   Select `last_name` (from `s_last_name`).
        *   Select `total_sales_amount` (from `s_total_sales`).
        *   Select `number_of_sales` (from `s_num_sales`).
        *   Calculate `SR` (Sales Rank): This is done using the `RANKING(by=s_total_sales.DESC())` function, which ranks salespersons based on their `s_total_sales` in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(total_sales_amount.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, the results are explicitly ordered by `total_sales_amount` in descending order, ensuring the salesperson with the highest sales appears first. This aligns with the ranking logic.

1.  **Augment Sales Data with Inventory Status**:
    *   Start with the `Sales` collection.
    *   For each sale, access the associated car (`Sales.car`).
    *   For this car, retrieve its `inventory_snapshots`.
    *   To find the latest inventory status, rank these snapshots by `snapshot_date` in descending order. The `RANKING` function with `per=""Cars""` ensures this is done for each car's set of snapshots independently.
    *   Use `SINGULAR()` to select the single latest snapshot.
    *   A flag `is_not_in_inventory` is then calculated. This flag is `True` if the latest snapshot exists and its `is_in_inventory` property is `False`.

2.  **Filter Relevant Sales**:
    *   Filter the augmented sales data to include only records where `is_not_in_inventory` is `True`.

3.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered sales data by the car's make (`car_make_val`) and model (`car_model_val`).
    *   For each make/model group, calculate the `highest_sale_price` by taking the `MAX()` of `sale_price_val` for all sales within that group.

2.  **` (LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")) `**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase make name contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards, allowing ""ford"" to appear anywhere in the make name.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase model name contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The logical OR operator, so cars matching either condition are included.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates Per Month Salesperson Sales count (PMSPS) and Per Month Sales Revenue (PMSR) for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive), focusing on sales made in the last six full months (excluding the current month).

1.  **Date Boundaries Definition (`date_config`):**
    *   It first establishes the reporting period by calculating the start of the current month (`calc_current_month_start`) and the start of the month six months prior (`calc_report_period_start`). These values are calculated once at the `Dealership` (graph) level.

2.  **Salesperson Filtering (`hired_salespersons`):**
    *   It filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 and 2023, inclusive.

3.  **Sales Data Retrieval and Filtering (`all_sales_from_hired_persons`, `sales_for_period`):**
    *   It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection for the filtered salespersons.
    *   These sales records are then filtered to include only those with a `sale_date` falling within the defined six-month reporting window (i.e., on or after `calc_report_period_start` and before `calc_current_month_start`).

4.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   For each relevant sale, the `sale_date` is truncated to the start of its month (`sale_month_truncated`). This standardized month value will be used for grouping.
    *   The `sale_price` is carried over as `price_of_sale` to be used in sum aggregation.

5.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_metrics_calc`):**
    *   The prepared sales data is partitioned (grouped) by `sale_month_truncated`.
    *   For each month group, it calculates:
        *   `PMSPS_val`: The count of sales records (`COUNT(Sales)`) in that month.
        *   `PMSR_val`: The sum of `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month.
    *   The results are ordered by the month (`report_month_val`) in ascending order.

6.  **Final Output Formatting (`final_report_data`):**
    *   The calculated fields are selected and renamed to `month`, `PMSPS`, and `PMSR` as requested for the final output.

**Note on ""Return all months"":** This query will list months within the specified six-month period for which there is actual sales data from the selected group of salespersons. If a month within this period has no sales from this group, it will not appear in the result.

- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- `AVG(Sales.WHERE(...).sale_price)` calculates the average sale price.
- `Sales.WHERE(...)` filters the sales:

    - `ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), (1, 2, 3))` ensures the sales are from January, February, or March (the first quarter).
- `.sale_price` specifies that the average should be calculated on the `sale_price` field of the filtered sales.",7.135745286941528,"asp_q1_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to:
1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for these sales.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of `cost` for the cars sold.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The PyDough code will first calculate the total revenue and total cost for sales in 2023. Then, it will use these values in a subsequent `CALCULATE` step to compute the GPM.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across all relevant sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For these filtered sales, it accesses their `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale in 2023, it navigates to the related `car` (from the `Cars` collection) and accesses its `cost`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Sales.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Sales` collection.
*   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1`: This condition checks if there is at least one inventory snapshot for the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`) that meets two criteria:
    *   `is_in_inventory == False`: The car is marked as out of inventory in this snapshot.
    *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: The date of this inventory snapshot (when it went out of inventory) is the same as the `sale_date` of the current sale.
*   `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: After filtering, this selects the single sale record that has the highest `sale_price`. The `.DESC()` ensures descending order, so the top one is the highest.
*   `.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`: For the selected top sale, this extracts:
    *   `make=car.make`: The make of the car involved in the sale.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change.

1.  **Data Preparation (`payments_info`):**
    *   It starts with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment record, it extracts the `payment_year_val` (year) and `payment_month_val` (month) from the `payment_date` field using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions.

2.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_aggregated_payments`):**
    *   The `payments_info` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_payment_groups"", by=(payment_year_val, payment_month_val))`. This groups the payment records by unique year-month combinations.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each month), `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Output the `output_year` (which is `payment_year_val`) and `output_month` (which is `payment_month_val`).
        *   Calculate `total_monthly_amount` by summing `payment_amount` for all payments within that specific year-month group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.
    *   The results are then ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC())`. This sorting is crucial for the correct operation of the `PREV` function in the next step.

3.  **MoM Change Calculation (`result`):**
    *   This final `CALCULATE` step operates on the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection.
    *   It includes `output_year`, `output_month`, and `total_monthly_amount` from the previous step.
    *   It calculates `month_over_month_change` using the formula: `total_monthly_amount - PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))`.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))` fetches the `total_monthly_amount` from the immediately preceding month in the ordered dataset.
        *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV` will return `None` (or a similar null equivalent), resulting in `month_over_month_change` being `None` for that first month, which is appropriate as there's no prior month to compare against.

The query will return results for each month that has payment records. Months with absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection will not be listed in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only salespersons who have at least one sale record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. The `HAS(sales_made) == 1` condition ensures that `COUNT(sales_made)` will be greater than zero, preventing division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this `CALCULATE` function computes new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Stores the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Stores the salesperson's last name.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP). `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` aggregates the total sales amount from all sales made by the salesperson, and `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the total number of sales.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This function takes the result from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 3 salespersons. The ranking is based on the `calculated_asp` field, in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the highest ASP are ranked first.
4.  `.CALCULATE(first_name=sp_first_name, last_name=sp_last_name, ASP=calculated_asp)`: This final `CALCULATE` function formats the output for the top 3 salespersons, selecting their first name, last name, and their calculated ASP, renaming them to the requested output field names.",26.04284262657165,"top_3_salespersons_by_asp = Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

Here's the PyDough code to find cars with no sales records and return their ID, make, model, and year.

The term ""left join"" in SQL is analogous to checking for the absence of related records in PyDough. We can achieve this by filtering the `Cars` collection for entries that do not have any associated `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**:
    *   We start with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to `Sales`) is empty for each car. `== 1` means we are looking for cars where this condition is true (i.e., they have no sales records).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**:
    *   After filtering, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the desired fields for the output.

4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select the `_id` of these salespersons, renaming it to `salesperson_id`. The result will inherently be a distinct list of IDs because `_id` is unique for each salesperson.

Explanation:
-   `Salespersons`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
-   `.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`: This is the core filtering logic.
    -   `sales_made`: For each salesperson, we look into their `sales_made` sub-collection (which represents their sales).

    *   `HASNOT(sales_made)==1` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection is empty for each salesperson. It returns `True` (or 1) if the salesperson has no sales records.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id, s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name)`**: This step selects and renames the desired fields for the salespersons who met the filter criteria:

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:

3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_amount_received.DESC())`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car using `car.make` and `car.model`. These are stored as new temporary fields `car_mk` and `car_mdl` in the `sales_info` collection. The original `sale_price` from each sale is implicitly carried over.

2.  `model_summary = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_info` collection. The `by=(car_mk, car_mdl)` clause groups the sales records by unique combinations of car make and model.
    *   Within each group (partition), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `make = car_mk`: The make of the car for the current group.
        *   `model = car_mdl`: The model of the car for the current group.
        *   `total_number_of_sales = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records belonging to the current make/model group.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` of all sales records in the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that car model.

3.  `result = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` is applied to the `model_summary`. This sorts all car models by their `total_revenue` in descending order and selects the top 5, effectively giving us the 5 best-selling car models by revenue. The output includes the `make`, `model`, `total_number_of_sales`, and `total_revenue` for each of these top 5 models.",63.66316866874695,"# Step 1: Create an intermediate collection from Sales, adding car make and model for partitioning.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`: These contextless expressions define the 3-month window. `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` gets the date 3 months ago, and `'start of day'` truncates it to the beginning of that day. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` represents today's date at midnight. The filter `(sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date <= end_period_date)` includes all sales made on or after the start date and on or before the end date.
2.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation iterates through each salesperson.
    *   `sales_rep_first_name=first_name` and `sales_rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's name.
    *   `total_revenue_for_period=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales (`sales_made`) associated with the current salesperson, but only for those sales where `sale_date` falls within our defined 3-month period.
    *   `num_sales_in_period=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales associated with the current salesperson that fall within the same 3-month period.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue_for_period.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This takes the collection of salespersons with their calculated metrics and selects the top 3 based on `total_revenue_for_period`. The `DESC(na_pos='last')` ensures that sorting is in descending order of revenue, and any salespersons with NULL revenue (e.g., if they had no sales or `SUM` resulted in NULL) are placed at the end.
4.  The `result` variable will hold a collection of up to 3 salespersons, each with their `sales_rep_first_name`, `sales_rep_last_name`, `total_revenue_for_period`, and `num_sales_in_period`, fulfilling the query requirements.",69.62845468521118,"# Define the start and end dates for the 3-month period.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two dynamic date boundaries at the `Dealership` level:
    *   `prev_iso_week_start_inclusive_calc`: This calculates the timestamp for the start of Monday of the previous ISO week (e.g., if ""now"" is a Wednesday, this will be the Monday of last week).
    *   `prev_iso_week_end_exclusive_calc`: This calculates the timestamp for the start of Monday of the current ISO week. This serves as the exclusive upper bound for our date filter, effectively including all of Sunday of the previous week.

2.  `.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection and filter its records. Only payments where `payment_date` is greater than or equal to `prev_iso_week_start_inclusive_calc` AND less than `prev_iso_week_end_exclusive_calc` are kept. This ensures we only consider payments from the entirety of the previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday).

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the filtered payments:
    *   `payment_day_val = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: We extract and normalize the `payment_date` to its day component (setting time to midnight). This is used for daily grouping.
    *   `payment_method_val = payment_method`: We alias `payment_method` to `payment_method_val` to be used as a partitioning key.
    *   The original `payment_amount` field from `PaymentsReceived` is implicitly carried forward.

4.  `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_val, payment_method_val))`: The records are then partitioned (grouped). Each group consists of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_val` and used the same `payment_method_val`.

5.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (after PARTITION): For each group created by the partition:
    *   `day_of_payment = payment_day_val`: We select the day for this group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, two new fields are derived for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: This extracts the `state` from the `customer` associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
        *   `q_start_date`: This determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the sale:
            *   Months 1, 2, 3 (Q1) map to ""2023-01-01"".
            *   Months 4, 5, 6 (Q2) map to ""2023-04-01"".
            *   Months 7, 8, 9 (Q3) map to ""2023-07-01"".
            *   Months 10, 11, 12 (Q4) map to ""2023-10-01"".
    *   The `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records is implicitly available for aggregation in the next step.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`result`):**
    *   The `sales_data_for_partition` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""quarterly_sales_groups"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   After partitioning, another `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_start_date = q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_sales = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific customer state and quarter. The `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records belonging to each partition group.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",55.76875281333923,"# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

Explanation:
The code calculates the average Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each drug.
1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: Iterates through each drug to compute new fields.
    *   `drug_name_val = drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
    *   `avg_ddd_val = AVG(...)`: Calculates the average DDD for the current drug. The `AVG` function operates on a collection of individual DDD values derived from the drug's treatments.
2.  The expression inside `AVG(...)` processes the `treatments_used_in` for each drug:
    *   `treatments_used_in.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments associated with the current drug, keeping only those that have a non-null `end_dt`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(duration_days = DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt), current_tot_drug_amt = tot_drug_amt)`: For these filtered treatments, it calculates:
        *   `duration_days`: The total duration of the treatment in days.
        *   `current_tot_drug_amt`: The total drug amount consumed, passed through from `tot_drug_amt`.
    *   `.WHERE(duration_days > 0)`: Further filters the treatments, keeping only those with a duration greater than 0 days. This prevents division by zero and ensures meaningful DDD calculation.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ddd_single_treatment = current_tot_drug_amt / duration_days)`: For the remaining valid treatments, it calculates the DDD for that single treatment.
    *   `.ddd_single_treatment`: This accesses the calculated `ddd_single_treatment` values, forming a collection of DDDs for all valid treatments of the current drug.

1.  **Define Date Ranges**: Calculate the start and end dates for the three relevant past months. The overall period will be from the start of the month 3 months ago to the start of the current month.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: Select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this overall three-month period.
3.  **Prepare Data for Grouping**: For each selected treatment, extract:
    *   The `patient_id`.
    *   A flag indicating if the treatment used a biologic drug (`drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`).
    *   A string representing the year and month of the treatment (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") to be used for grouping.
4.  **Group by Month**: Partition the prepared treatment data by the year-month string.
5.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each month group:
    *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s to get the `patient_count`.
    *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s for treatments that were flagged as biologic to get the `biologic_treatment_count`.
6.  **Order Results**: Order the final results by month.

# Step 1: Calculate date boundaries at the graph level.
# These define the overall period: from 3 months ago (inclusive start) up to the current month (exclusive end).
date_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    # Start of the current month (this will be the exclusive end of our period)

)

# Step 6: Order the results by month in ascending order.
result = monthly_patient_stats.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We first establish the date boundaries for our analysis. `val_current_month_start` is the first day of the current month, and `val_three_months_ago_start` is the first day of the month three months prior to the current month. This defines a period covering the last three full calendar months.
2.  `treatments_in_relevant_period = date_info.Treatments.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection. The `date_info` values are available in this context.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within our defined three-month window.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, we create:
        *   `p_id`: An alias for `patient_id` for easier reference.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the treatment's drug (`Treatments.drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'.
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2023-04"") representing the month of the treatment, used for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month part is always two digits.
3.  `monthly_patient_stats = treatments_in_relevant_period.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `treatments_in_relevant_period` data using `treatment_month_year_key`. This groups all treatments by the month in which they started.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each monthly group:

2.  **Partition by Specialty**: Group the doctors by their `speciality`. This creates logical groups within which ranking will occur.
3.  **Rank within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`) based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed. The ranking will be in descending order of distinct drug counts (more drugs = higher rank, i.e., rank 1).

    *   The `treatment_month_start_dt_val` must be on or after the start of the month that was 12 months before the start of the current month.
    *   The `treatment_month_start_dt_val` must be before the start of the current month.
    For example, if the current date is October 15, 2023, the current month starts on October 1, 2023. Twelve months prior to this is October 1, 2022. The filter will include treatments from October 1, 2022, up to (but not including) October 1, 2023, effectively covering months from October 2022 to September 2023.

3.  **Group by Month and Calculate Metrics**: The filtered treatments are then partitioned (grouped) by the `treatment_year_month_str_val`. For each monthly group:
    *   `month`: This is the year-month string (e.g., ""2023-09"").
    *   `PMPD` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id` values from the `Treatments` records within that month's group. This counts how many unique patients received a diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
    *   `PMTC` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated as the total count of `Treatments` records within that month's group.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered chronologically by the `month` string.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those who have received at least one treatment where the associated drug's name is 'Drugalin'. This is done by checking the `treatments_received` sub-collection for each patient, and within those treatments, checking the `drug.drug_name`.
3.  For the filtered set of unique patients, calculate the average of their `weight_kg`.
4.  The final result will be a single value representing this average weight, calculated at the `DermTreatment` graph level.

*   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, which is appropriate for producing a single aggregate result.
*   `average_weight=AVG(...)`: This defines the output field `average_weight` and assigns it the result of the `AVG` (average) function.
*   `Patients.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Patients` collection and applying a filter.
*   `HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(drug.drug_name == 'Drugalin')) == 1`: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `treatments_received`: Accesses the list of treatments for each patient.
    *   `.WHERE(drug.drug_name == 'Drugalin')`: Filters these treatments to only include those where the `drug` used has a `drug_name` equal to 'Drugalin'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if there is at least one such treatment for the patient. This ensures we are considering patients who were actually treated with 'Drugalin'.
*   `.weight_kg`: After filtering the patients, this accesses the `weight_kg` attribute for each of the selected patients.

1.  **Identify Each Patient's First Treatment**: For each patient, find all treatments they've received (`Patients.treatments_received`). Then, rank these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The treatment with rank 1 is the patient's first-ever treatment.
2.  **Filter for First Treatments**: Keep only those treatments that are identified as a patient's first treatment. Each record at this stage represents a patient becoming ""new"" to the system.
3.  **Determine Year of First Treatment**: For each of these first treatments, extract the year from its `start_dt`. This is the year the patient became a ""new patient"".
4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function is used here. For the earliest year in the data, NPI will be `None` as there's no preceding year for comparison.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year. If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the data), `PREV` returns `None`, making the `npi` also `None`.",86.36198925971985,"# Step 1: Access treatments for each patient and rank them by start date

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc = Outcomes.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It filters for records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null, as per the requirement.
2.  `pir_calculation_steps = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts a calculation at the highest level of the database (`DermTreatment`) to compute global statistics.
    *   `avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` across all outcomes present in the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc` collection.
    *   `avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc.day100_pasi_score)`: Similarly, calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_d7d100pir = IFF(...))`: This subsequent `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step to apply the D7D100PIR formula.
    *   `IFF(avg_pasi_d7 == 0, None, ...)`: This conditional logic checks if `avg_pasi_d7` is zero. If it is, `None` is returned for the PIR to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, the formula `(avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0` is computed. The `100.0` ensures the result is a float and represents a percentage.
4.  `result = pir_calculation_steps.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR_percentage = calculated_d7d100pir)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the `calculated_d7d100pir` value and renames it to `D7D100PIR_percentage`, which is the requested output.

What is the PIC for female patients?PIC = private insured patient count,SELECT COUNT(patient_id) AS pic FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Female' AND ins_type = 'private';,DermTreatment,"To calculate the Private Insured Patient Count (PIC) for female patients, we need to:
1. Access the `Patients` collection.
2. Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Female'.
3. Further filter these female patients to include only those whose `ins_type` indicates private insurance. We'll assume 'Private' is the value for private insurance.
4. Count the number of patients who meet both criteria.
5. Assign this count to a field named `PIC`.

```python

Explanation:
- We start with the `DermTreatment` graph, which is the entry point to access all collections.
- We use the `CALCULATE` function to compute a new value.
- `PIC` is the name of the field we are creating.
- `COUNT(Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private')))`:
    - `Patients` refers to the collection of all patients.
    - `.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private'))` filters the patients.
        - `gender == 'Female'` selects patients whose gender is 'Female'.
        - `ins_type == 'Private'` selects patients whose insurance type is 'Private'.
        - The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only patients who are female AND have private insurance are selected.
    - `COUNT(...)` then counts the number of patients that satisfy the combined conditions.
The final result will be a single record with one field, `PIC`, containing the count of female patients with private insurance.",9.365296363830566,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

We need to return the drug's ID, name, and this count of adverse events.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to calculate the total number of relevant adverse events. This total will be a sum over all treatments associated with that drug.
3.  For each `treatment` associated with a drug (via `treatments_used_in`):
    a.  Determine the year and month of the treatment's `start_dt`. We'll create intermediate fields `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` for this.
    b.  Access the `adverse_events` for this specific treatment.
    c.  Filter these adverse events to include only those where the `reported_dt` falls within the same year and month as the treatment's `start_dt` (i.e., `YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr` and `MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth`).
    d.  Count these filtered adverse events for the current treatment. Let's call this `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`.
4.  Sum these counts (`count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`) across all treatments for the current drug. This gives the total number of relevant adverse events for the drug, which we'll call `num_adv_events`.
5.  After calculating `num_adv_events` for every drug, use `TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())` to find the drug with the highest count.
6.  The final result should include the drug's ID (`drug_id`), name (`drug_name`), and the calculated `num_adv_events`.

This requires nested calculations: an outer `CALCULATE` on `Drugs` to compute `num_adv_events`, and inner `CALCULATE` operations on `treatments_used_in` to determine the count for each treatment before summing them up. Due to the rule that new fields defined in a `CALCULATE` are only available after it completes, we'll need two chained `CALCULATE` calls on `treatments_used_in`.

```python
result = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    d_id = drug_id,
    d_name = drug_name,
    num_adv_events = SUM(

        ).CALCULATE(

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `d_id = drug_id`: Selects the drug's ID.
    *   `d_name = drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
    *   `num_adv_events = SUM(...)`: This calculates the total number of relevant adverse events for the current drug. The `SUM` function aggregates counts derived from each associated treatment.

2.  `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`: This first inner `CALCULATE` operates on the collection of treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `treatment_start_yr = YEAR(start_dt)`: Extracts the year from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_mth = MONTH(start_dt)`: Extracts the month from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    These fields (`treatment_start_yr`, `treatment_start_mth`) are now available for the subsequent `CALCULATE`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second inner `CALCULATE` (chained after the first one on `treatments_used_in`) still operates on each treatment.
    *   `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment = COUNT(...)`: For each treatment, this counts its adverse events that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   `adverse_events.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `adverse_events` sub-collection of the current treatment.
        *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth)`: This condition ensures that the adverse event's `reported_dt` is in the same calendar month and year as the treatment's `start_dt`.

4.  `.count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`: This refers to the result of the `COUNT` operation from the second inner `CALCULATE`. The `SUM` function in the outer `CALCULATE` (on `Drugs`) aggregates these per-treatment counts to get the total for the drug.

5.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())`: After calculating `d_id`, `d_name`, and `num_adv_events` for all drugs, this function selects the single drug that has the highest `num_adv_events`, ordering in descending order.",50.15411329269409,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Filter and Flatten Data**: We start by selecting `Treatments` that ended in the year 2022. For each of these treatments, we access their `outcome_records`. From each outcome record, we extract the `day100_pasi_score`, and by navigating back to the `treatment` and then its `patient`, we get the patient's `ins_type` and `patient_id`. This creates a flattened dataset where each row corresponds to an outcome record from a relevant treatment, along with associated patient details.
2.  **Group by Insurance Type**: We then `PARTITION` this flattened data by the patient's insurance type (`ins_type_of_patient`).
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each insurance type group, we calculate:
    *   `avg_day100_pasi`: The average of `day100_pasi_score` values.
    *   `distinct_patient_count`: The number of distinct `patient_id` values.
4.  **Select Top 5**: Finally, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 insurance types, ordering them by `avg_day100_pasi` in ascending order (lowest first).

1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  Filter out diagnoses that do not have any associated outcome records, as these cannot have an itch score.
3.  For each remaining diagnosis, calculate:
    *   `diagnosis_name`: The name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` found in the `Outcomes` linked to the treatments for that diagnosis.
    *   `num_patients`: The number of distinct patients who received treatments for that diagnosis. This is found by counting distinct `patient_id`s from the `Patients` linked through `Treatments`.
4.  Select the top 3 diagnoses based on the `max_itch_score` in descending order. If there's a tie in `max_itch_score`, the `TOP_K` function's default behavior for ties will apply (which usually means arbitrary order for ties unless a secondary key could be specified, but `TOP_K` takes a single expression for `by`).
5.  The final result will include the diagnosis name, the calculated number of distinct patients, and the maximum itch score for these top 3 diagnoses.

).TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score.DESC())  # Get top 3 diagnoses by max_itch_score
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Diagnoses.WHERE(HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Diagnoses` collection and filters it to include only those diagnoses that have at least one treatment record which in turn has at least one outcome record. This is crucial for calculations involving outcome data like `day100_itch_vas`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new fields for each diagnosis:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Selects the name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis. The path `treatments_for.outcome_records` navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments, and then to the outcome records of those treatments.
    *   `num_patients=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis. The path `treatments_for.patient.patient_id` navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments, then to the patient linked to each treatment, and finally accesses their `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` ensures each patient is counted only once.

This analysis is restricted to treatments that commenced within the last six calendar months. The final output should list the specialty, the total number of treatments administered by that specialty within the period, and the corresponding total drug amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is augmented using `CALCULATE` to include:
        *   `treatment_start_dt_calc`: The start date of the treatment, derived from the `start_dt` field.
        *   `doc_specialty_calc`: The specialty of the doctor who prescribed the treatment, accessed via `doctor.speciality`.
    *   Original fields like `tot_drug_amt` remain accessible.

2.  **Filter by Date**:
    *   The augmented treatment data is filtered using `WHERE` to include only treatments where `treatment_start_dt_calc` is on or after the start of the calendar month that was five months prior to the current month's start. This effectively covers the ""past 6 calendar months"" (e.g., if 'now' is July, this includes treatments from February 1st onwards).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-5 months')` calculates this boundary date.

3.  **Group by Specialty and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered `recent_treatments_info` collection is then partitioned by `doc_specialty_calc` using `PARTITION(name=""docs_by_specialty"", by=(doc_specialty_calc))`.
    *   Within each specialty group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The doctor's specialty (from `doc_specialty_calc`).
        *   `number_of_treatments`: The count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered period, obtained using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments by that specialty in the filtered period, obtained using `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`.

4.  **Select Top 3 Specialties**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_summary` to retrieve the top 3 specialties ranked by `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount for the top 3 specialties.

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"The user wants to count treatments based on three main criteria:
1.  The associated diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"" (case-insensitively, with wildcards).
2.  The drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (implying it's FDA-approved).
3.  The treatment's end date is within the last 6 months from the current date and the treatment has indeed ended.

We can achieve this by:
1.  Starting with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filtering these treatments using a `WHERE` clause that combines all conditions:
    *   For the diagnosis: `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`. We use `UPPER` to ensure case-insensitivity and `%` for wildcard matching.
    *   For FDA approval: `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`, which checks if the `fda_appr_dt` field (FDA approval date) exists for the drug associated with the treatment.
    *   For the end date:
        *   The treatment must have an end date: `HAS(end_dt) == 1`.
        *   The end date must be on or before today: `end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`.
        *   The end date must be on or after 6 months ago from today: `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`.
3.  Counting the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Filter treatments based on the specified criteria
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &                       # Drug has an FDA approval date
    (HAS(end_dt) == 1) &                                 # Treatment has an end date

    (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))                          # Treatment has ended (end date is not in the future)
)

# Calculate the total count of such treatments
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters.
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`: This condition checks if the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with the treatment contains ""psoriasis"". `UPPER` is used on `diag_name` and the pattern is in uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching. The `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the `drug` used in the treatment has an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), implying it's FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures the treatment has an actual end date recorded.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`**:
    *   Starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to include only those records where `is_placebo` is true.

2.  **First `.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `treatment_id_val = treatment_id`: Stores the `treatment_id` of the placebo treatment.
    *   `current_treatment_start_dt = start_dt`: Stores the `start_dt` (start date) of the placebo treatment. This is crucial for use in the sub-query for `concomitant_meds`.
    *   `treatment_end_dt_val = end_dt`: Stores the `end_dt` (end date) of the placebo treatment.
    *   `qualifying_concomitant_meds = concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`: This processes the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each placebo treatment.
        *   The `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications:
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", current_treatment_start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date. `current_treatment_start_dt` refers to the parent treatment's start date, and the second `start_dt` refers to the concomitant medication's start date.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", current_treatment_start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started no more than 14 days (2 weeks) after the treatment's start date.
        *   The nested `.CALCULATE(...)` then selects the required fields for these filtered concomitant medications:
            *   `con_med_start_dt = start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication.
            *   `con_med_end_dt = end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

3.  **`.WHERE(HAS(qualifying_concomitant_meds) == 1)`**:
    *   After calculating `qualifying_concomitant_meds` for each placebo treatment, this filters out any treatments that do not have at least one concomitant medication meeting the specified date criteria.

4.  **Second `.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output to include only the requested fields with clear names:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment_id_val`: The ID of the placebo treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_date = current_treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the placebo treatment.

2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (obtained using `DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  Round the resulting average age to the nearest integer using the `ROUND` function with 0 decimal places.
6.  The final result will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to compute this.

Explanation:
-   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want to compute a single aggregated value over the entire dataset.
-   `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'private'))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only male patients who have 'private' insurance. We assume 'private' is the value stored in the `ins_type` field for private insurance.
-   `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age.
    -   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This effectively gives the age in integer years.
    -   The result of this calculation is stored in a temporary field `current_age_in_years`.
-   `.current_age_in_years`: This accesses the calculated ages for the `AVG` function.
-   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients who met the filter criteria.
-   `ROUND(..., 0)`: This rounds the calculated average age to 0 decimal places, effectively providing an integer result as requested.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions where `status == ""completed""` are successful and that these are typically `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Calculate the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This will be the numerator for CPUR. We'll use `NDISTINCT` on the `coupon_id` field of the successful transactions.
4.  Calculate the total number of distinct successful transactions. This will be the denominator for CPUR. We'll use `COUNT` on the successful transactions.
5.  Compute CPUR as `(number of distinct coupons used) / (number of distinct transactions)`.
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
7.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

This is achieved using a two-step `CALCULATE`:
*   The first `CALCULATE` computes the counts for distinct coupons and distinct transactions.
*   The second `CALCULATE` uses these counts to compute CPUR and selects the final required fields.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
2.  `merchant_name=name`: We select the merchant's name.
3.  `num_distinct_coupons = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`:
    *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(status == ""completed"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those marked as ""completed"" (assumed to be successful).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` for each of these successful transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions. This gives the number of distinct coupons used.
4.  `num_distinct_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`:
    *   This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the results from the first:
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant name.
    *   `CPUR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_transactions > 0, ...)`: This checks if there are any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons / num_distinct_successful_transactions`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the total number of successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_context`: We start by calculating `current_week_start_ts` (the timestamp for the beginning of the current week) at the `Ewallet` (graph) level. This provides a stable reference for date calculations.
2.  `notifications_with_week_info`:
    *   We access `Users` and filter for those in the ""US"" or ""CA"".
    *   Then, we access their `notifications`.
    *   For each notification, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start date of the week the notification was created, effectively truncating `created_at` to the week.
        *   `is_weekend_notification_flag`: A flag (1 if true, 0 if false) indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME()`.
        *   `num_weeks_ago`: The difference in full weeks between the notification's week and the `current_week_start_ts`.
3.  `relevant_notifications_for_period`: We filter the above results to keep only notifications where `num_weeks_ago` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_notification_summary` (assigned to `result`):
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_notifications_for_period` by `notification_actual_week_start`. This groups notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for which the counts are being reported.
        *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications sent in that week (achieved by `COUNT(Notifications)` within the partition group).
        *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications sent on a weekend during that week (achieved by `SUM(is_weekend_notification_flag)` over the items in the partition group).
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.",60.1022846698761,"# Step 1: Calculate the start of the current week for reference.

*   `.WHERE((status == ""active"") & (LOWER(category) == ""retail"") & (HAS(coupons) == 1))`: This clause filters the merchants based on three conditions:
    *   `status == ""active""`: Ensures the merchant is currently active.
    *   `LOWER(category) == ""retail""`: Checks if the merchant's category is ""retail"", ignoring case by converting the `category` field to lowercase.
    *   `HAS(coupons) == 1`: Ensures that the merchant has at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS()` function checks for the existence of records in the `coupons` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons))`: For each merchant that passes the filter, this clause calculates two new fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the merchant.
    *   `total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`: Counts the number of coupons associated with each merchant using the `COUNT()` aggregation function on the `coupons` sub-collection.

2.  Access the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for these US users. These represent transactions made by them.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`. This condition means the difference in days between the transaction's creation date (`created_at`) and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`) must be 6 days or less. This covers today (0 days diff) and the 6 preceding days, totaling 7 days.
4.  Calculate the total count of these filtered transactions using `COUNT()`.
5.  Calculate the sum of the `amount` for these filtered transactions using `SUM()`.
6.  The results are presented as `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount` using a `CALCULATE` operation on the top-level `Ewallet` collection.

1.  **Filter User Balances**: We first select records from the `UserBalances` collection that have been updated within the last 7 days. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to compare the `updated_at` timestamp with the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: According to the definition, ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". For each user whose balance was updated in the specified period, we calculate their average balance from these updated records. This is done by partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id` and then applying the `AVG()` function to the `balance` field within each user's group. This gives the AMB for each user.
3.  **Calculate the Overall Average AMB**: Finally, we calculate the average of all the per-user AMBs computed in the previous step. This will give the single ""average balance"" value requested.

The query assumes that `UserBalances` might contain multiple balance entries (snapshots) for a single user within the 7-day period. If a user's balance was updated multiple times, their AMB will be the average of those recorded balances. If `UserBalances` only stores the single most current balance per user, this approach is still valid; the AMB per user would simply be their latest balance if it was updated in the past week.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_user_balances`: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection. It keeps only those records where the `updated_at` timestamp is within the last 7 days, inclusive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between `updated_at` and the current moment.
2.  `user_amb_values`: This part takes the `recent_user_balances` and groups them by `user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each user), it calculates `amb_for_this_user` as the average of their `balance` values found in the `recent_user_balances`. This aligns with the definition of AMB as the average balance per user for the specified time duration.

1.  We start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we will calculate a new field called `LUB`.
3.  To determine the `LUB`, we look into the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user. These are `UserBalances` records, each having an `updated_at` timestamp and a `balance` amount.
4.  We use the `RANKING` window function on these `balances`. The ranking is performed `by` the `updated_at` field in descending order (`DESC()`), ensuring the most recent balance gets the top rank. The `per=""Users""` argument ensures this ranking is done independently for each user's set of balances.
5.  We then filter these ranked balances to keep only the one where `RANKING(...) == 1`, which corresponds to the latest balance entry.
6.  Since this filtering results in at most one balance record per user, we use `.SINGULAR()` to treat it as a single record.

This involves summing up the amounts from successfully received transactions where the merchant is the receiver and `receiver_type` is 1. Then, merchants are ranked based on this revenue.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant**:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue. This revenue is the sum of `amount` from their `transactions_received`.
    *   These transactions are filtered to include only those that were ""successfully received"" (assumed `status == ""completed""`) and where the `receiver_type` on the transaction record is 1 (as specified for merchants).
    *   The merchant's `name` and `category` are also selected. These intermediate results are stored in `merchant_data`.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Output**:
    *   Using the `merchant_data` (which now has `m_name`, `m_category`, and `m_revenue` for each merchant), we perform a second `CALCULATE`.
    *   We select the `merchant_name` (from `m_name`), `category` (from `m_category`), and `revenue_amount` (from `m_revenue`).
    *   The `revenue_rank` is computed using the `RANKING()` window function. It ranks merchants in descending order of their `m_revenue` (so rank 1 is the highest revenue), which aligns with the definition of MRR.
    *   The final result includes the merchant's name, category, their total revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

What is the PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) for wallet transactions in the last 2 months excluding the current month?PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) = distinct sender with  sender_type = 0.

1.  **Determine the Date Range**: We need to identify transactions that occurred from the start of the month, two months prior to the current month, up to the start of the current month (exclusive). For example, if the current date is in July, we'll consider transactions from May 1st up to (but not including) July 1st.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this calculated date range and have a `sender_type` of 0, as per the PMDAU definition.
3.  **Extract Temporal Information**: For each relevant transaction, extract the year and month from its `created_at` timestamp. This is necessary for monthly aggregation. We also carry forward the `sender_id` for the distinct count.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the filtered transactions by year and month. For each year-month group, calculate the PMDAU by counting the number of distinct `sender_id`s.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by year and month for clarity.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the query:
# 'two_months_ago_start_date' is the beginning of the month that was two months ago (e.g., if today is July 15th, this will be May 1st).
# 'current_month_start_date' is the beginning of the current month (e.g., July 1st).
# The period of interest is [two_months_ago_start_date, current_month_start_date).

# Order the results by year and then by month for a clear, chronological view.
final_pmdau_result = pmdau_calculation.ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `two_months_ago_start_date` and `current_month_start_date` are contextless expressions defining the time window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')` calculates the date for the start of the month that was two full months prior to the current month.
2.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified date range and were initiated by a sender of `sender_type = 0`.
3.  The first `CALCULATE` call on `relevant_transactions_for_pmdau` creates a new collection `transactions_with_month_info`. For each transaction, it adds `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` (extracted from `created_at`) and includes `sender_id` under the new name `sender_id_val`. This prepares the data for monthly aggregation.
4.  `PARTITION(name=""monthly_active_users_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))` groups the `transactions_with_month_info` data by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
5.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these monthly groups. It outputs `year_of_transaction` and `month_of_transaction` (which are the partitioning keys) and `pmdau`. The `pmdau` is calculated using `NDISTINCT(sender_id_val)`, which counts the unique sender IDs within each monthly group, fulfilling the PMDAU definition.
6.  Finally, `ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())` sorts the monthly PMDAU figures chronologically.",58.24796223640442,"# Define the date boundaries for the query:

1.  Start with the `Users` collection to process each user.
2.  For each user, calculate the sum of durations of their sessions that fall within the specified date range.
    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).

    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).

        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

2.  Filter all transactions that occurred within this date range.
3.  Count the total number of these filtered transactions.
4.  Count how many of these transactions were ""successful"". We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` field is ""completed"".
5.  Calculate STR using the formula: `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100`.
6.  Handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero, returning 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_boundary` and `current_month_start_boundary`: These contextless expressions define the time window for the ""previous month"". `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 months')` calculates the start of the month preceding the current one. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the start of the current month. Transactions are included if their `created_at` timestamp is on or after `prev_month_start_boundary` and before `current_month_start_boundary`.
2.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: The calculation is performed at the top `Ewallet` graph level because STR is a single aggregate metric for all relevant transactions.
3.  `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: This counts transactions that meet three criteria:
    *   Their `created_at` date falls within the previously defined previous month.
    *   Their `status` is ""completed"" (this is an assumption for what constitutes a successful transaction, as ""successful"" status values are not explicitly defined in the schema).
4.  `num_total_tx_prev_month`: This counts all transactions whose `created_at` date falls within the previous month, regardless of their status.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` computes `calculated_previous_month_str`:
    *   It uses an `IFF` condition to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than 0. This prevents division by zero errors if no transactions occurred in the previous month.
    *   If there were transactions, STR is calculated as `(num_successful_tx_prev_month / num_total_tx_prev_month) * 100.0` to express it as a percentage.
    *   If there were no transactions, STR is set to `0.0`.
6.  `result = str_calculation.CALCULATE(previous_month_str = calculated_previous_month_str)`: The final step selects only the `calculated_previous_month_str` and assigns it to the field `previous_month_str`, ensuring the output contains only the requested STR value.",47.57816648483277,"# Define the date boundaries for the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_creation_date_parts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:

    *   This step takes the records from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using a `WHERE` clause:
            *   `YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation year matches the merchant's creation year.
            *   `MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation month matches the merchant's creation month.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are passed through as `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val`.

"How many distinct active users sent money per month in 2023? Return the number of active users per month (as a date), starting from the earliest date. Do not include merchants in the query.

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_date` in ascending order, presenting the data from the earliest month in 2023 onwards.

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection who meet the specified criteria:
    *   Their `status` must be ""active"".
    *   Their `category` must contain the substring 'retail'. We'll use the `CONTAINS` function for this.
    *   They must have at least one balance record. We use `HAS(balances) == 1` to ensure this, which is important before attempting to find the ""latest"" balance.

2.  **Identify Latest Balance for Each Filtered Merchant**: For each merchant identified in step 1, we need to find their most recent balance.
    *   We access their `balances` sub-collection (which refers to `MerchantBalances` records).
    *   We use the `RANKING` window function, ordering the balances by `updated_at` in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` clause ensures that this ranking is done independently for each merchant from our filtered set.
    *   We then filter these ranked balances to keep only those with `RANKING(...) == 1`, effectively selecting the latest balance record for each qualifying merchant.

3.  **Calculate Median Balance**: Once we have the collection of latest balance records (one per relevant merchant), we extract the `balance` amount from each of these records.
    *   We then use the `MEDIAN` aggregation function to compute the median of these balance amounts.
    *   The final result will be a single value representing the median merchant wallet balance, calculated at the `Ewallet` (graph) level.

The term ""today's"" in the request is interpreted as the ""current"" or ""most recent"" balance, rather than balances specifically updated on the calendar day of today. This is a common interpretation for ""wallet balance"" and is more robust, as merchants may not have balance updates every day.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line processes the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `p_device_type = device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for each session and assigns it to a new field `p_device_type`. This field will be used as the key for partitioning.
    *   `duration_in_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in the `duration_in_seconds` field.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_grouped_by_device"", by=(p_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `p_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type = p_device_type, avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds))`: This operation is performed for each group created by the `PARTITION`.
        *   `device_type = p_device_type`: Includes the `device_type` (which is the partition key `p_device_type`) in the final output.
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_in_seconds` field for all sessions within the current `sessions_grouped_by_device` group.
