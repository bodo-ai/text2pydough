**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Dealership` collection.
    *   `start_of_current_week`: Finds the date corresponding to the beginning of the current calendar week (e.g., the preceding Sunday or Monday, depending on configuration).
    *   `start_of_period`: Calculates the date 8 weeks prior to the `start_of_current_week`. This defines the beginning of our target time window.
2.  **`payments_in_period = date_boundaries.Sales...CALCULATE(...)`**: This chain performs several steps:
    *   `date_boundaries.Sales`: Accesses the `Sales` collection, inheriting the calculated date boundaries.
    *   `.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`: Filters for sales records where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
    *   `.payment`: Accesses the `PaymentsReceived` records associated with these high-value sales.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_of_period) & (payment_date < start_of_current_week))`: Filters these payments to include only those made within the last 8 full calendar weeks (from `start_of_period` up to, but not including, `start_of_current_week`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates two new fields for each relevant payment:
        *   `payment_week_start`: Determines the starting date of the calendar week in which the `payment_date` falls.
        *   `is_weekend_payment`: A boolean flag indicating whether the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`.
3.  **`weekly_payment_summary = payments_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: This part aggregates the results:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=payment_week_start)`: Groups the `payments_in_period` records based on the `payment_week_start` date. Each group represents a unique week within our 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week=payment_week_start`: Selects the week's starting date.
        *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(payments_in_period)`: Counts the total number of payments within that week's group.
        *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(payments_in_period.is_weekend_payment)`: Sums the `is_weekend_payment` boolean flag (where True is treated as 1 and False as 0) to count the weekend payments in that group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries by the week start date in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to select and compute fields for each salesperson.
2.  **`salesperson_id=_id, sp_first_name=first_name, sp_last_name=last_name`**: We select the salesperson's ID, first name, and last name, renaming them for clarity in the output.
3.  **`num_sales=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_sales`.
4.  **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (representing all sales made by the current salesperson) and filter it using `WHERE`.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`**: This condition filters the sales.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   `<= 29` ensures we include sales from today and the previous 29 days, covering the requested 30-day period inclusive of today.
6.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This counts the number of sales records remaining in the `sales_made` sub-collection after the date filter is applied, giving the count of sales within the last 30 days for that specific salesperson.
7.  **`.ORDER_BY(num_sales.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting collection of salespersons in descending order based on the calculated `num_sales`.",17.410518646240234,"sales_count_last_30_days = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars_with_sales = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%')`: It checks if the lowercase version of the `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity.
    *   `(HAS(sale_records) == 1)`: It ensures that the car has at least one associated sale record by checking if the `sale_records` sub-collection is not empty.
2.  **`sales_count_by_model = filtered_cars_with_sales.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered cars and partitions (groups) them.
    *   `name=""car_model_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(make, model)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique combinations of `make` and `model`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this calculates the required fields for each group:
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` from the partition key.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` from the partition key.

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 29`: It filters sales records where the sale date occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of the current day. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`'now'`). A value of 0 means the sale happened today, 1 means yesterday, and so on. Therefore, `<= 29` includes today and the 29 preceding days, covering a total of 30 days.

**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` computes the total sales amount (`total_sales`) by summing the `sale_price` from each salesperson's related sales (`sales_made`) and the total number of sales (`sales_count`) by counting these related sales. It also selects the first and last names, renaming them temporarily to avoid conflicts.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first step and calculates the sales rank (`sales_rank`) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is based on the previously calculated `total_sales`, ordered in descending order (`DESC()`). It also renames `total_sales` to `total_sales_amount` and `sales_count` to `number_of_sales`.
4.  The final `CALCULATE` selects the required fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, `number_of_sales`) and renames `sales_rank` to `SR` to match the requested output format.",19.248276948928837,"# Step 1: Calculate aggregates (total sales amount and number of sales) for each salesperson.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`relevant_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection to include only cars that meet two initial criteria:
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: The car must have at least one associated sale record.
    *   `HAS(inventory_snapshots) == 1`: The car must have at least one inventory snapshot record (necessary to determine its latest status).
2.  **`cars_sold_and_not_in_inventory = relevant_cars.WHERE(...)`**: We further filter the `relevant_cars`. For each car, we look at its `inventory_snapshots`:
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`: We rank the snapshots within each car's context (`per=""Cars""`) based on `snapshot_date` in descending order. Rank 1 corresponds to the most recent snapshot.
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: We filter the snapshots to keep only the one with rank 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking filter ensures only one snapshot per car remains, we use `SINGULAR()` to treat it as a single record.
    *   `.is_in_inventory == False`: We check if the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot is `False`. Only cars meeting this condition are kept.
3.  **`grouped_cars = cars_sold_and_not_in_inventory.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered cars (`cars_sold_and_not_in_inventory`) into groups based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`.
4.  **`highest_prices_by_make_model = grouped_cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   We select the `make` and `model` (which are the partition keys).
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: We calculate the maximum `sale_price` by looking at all `sale_records` associated with the cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting groups in descending order based on the calculated `highest_sale_price`.
6.  **`result = highest_prices_by_make_model`**: The final result is assigned to the `result` variable.",31.948904514312744,"# Filter cars that have been sold and have inventory snapshots

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it based on the specified criteria.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains the substring 'ford'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity.
3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains the substring 'mustang'.
4.  **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so cars matching either condition are included.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we select and calculate the required fields for the resulting cars.
6.  **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These lines select the basic car details directly.
7.  **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which contains all sales for that car) and applies the `AVG` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field within those records. If a car has no sales records, the average might result in null or zero depending on the system's handling of empty sets in aggregations.",14.54842472076416,"# Filter cars based on make containing 'Ford' or model containing 'Mustang' (case-insensitive, partial match)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info`**: Calculates the `start_date` (start of the month 6 months prior to the current month) and `end_date` (end of the previous month) using `DATETIME` functions relative to the current time (`'now'`).
2.  **`all_sales_in_range`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales falling within the calculated `start_date` and `end_date`. It then calculates the `sale_month` in 'YYYY-MM' format and retrieves the `salesperson_hire_year` and `sale_price` for each relevant sale.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: Partitions the `all_sales_in_range` data by `sale_month`. This creates groups for each month that had at least one sale during the specified period. The sub-collection within each partition is named `month_data`.
4.  **`monthly_metrics`**: Calculates the final metrics for each month group:
    *   It accesses the `month_data` sub-collection for each month.
    *   It calculates `target_sales_count` by counting records within `month_data` where the `salesperson_hire_year` is between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive).
    *   It calculates `target_sales_revenue` by summing the `sale_price` for the same filtered records within `month_data`.
    *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales count) is assigned the `target_sales_count`, defaulting to 0 using `DEFAULT_TO` if the count was null (i.e., no sales from target salespersons in that month).
    *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is assigned the `target_sales_revenue`, defaulting to 0.0 using `DEFAULT_TO` if the sum was null.
5.  The final `CALCULATE` selects only the `month`, `PMSPS`, and `PMSR` columns.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically by month.
7.  The result is assigned to the `result` variable.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only those records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
2.  **`totals_for_gpm = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates the necessary aggregate values at the top `Dealership` level:
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales that occurred in 2023.
    *   `total_cost = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`: Sums the `cost` of the cars associated with the sales in 2023. It accesses the cost by navigating from the filtered sales (`sales_in_2023`) to their linked car (`car`) and then to the car's `cost`.
3.  **`gpm_result = totals_for_gpm.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) based on the previously calculated totals:
    *   `gpm_2023 = IFF(...)`: It uses the `IFF` function to perform the calculation `(total_revenue - total_cost) / total_cost * 100.0` only if `total_cost` is not zero. If `total_cost` is zero, it returns `None` to prevent a division-by-zero error. We multiply by `100.0` to get a percentage and ensure floating-point division.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection and creates a new field `pay_month` by concatenating the year and zero-padded month from the `payment_date` (e.g., ""2023-05"").
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `payment_info` data based on the unique values of `pay_month`. For each unique month (`month_str`), it calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments falling within that month, storing it as `total_payment`.
3.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the results of the partition (one row per month).
    *   It renames `month_str` to `month` and `total_payment` to `total_payments_received` for clarity.
    *   It calculates `mom_change` using the `PREV` window function. `PREV(total_payment, by=month_str.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_payment` value from the *previous* row when the data is ordered by `month_str` ascending. The difference between the current month's `total_payment` and the previous month's total gives the MoM change. `default=0.0` ensures the first month has a defined previous value (0).
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Sorts the results chronologically.
5.  **`final_result = result.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects only the final required columns: `month`, `total_payments_received`, and `mom_change`.

This query calculates the total payments received for each month present in the data and the corresponding month-over-month change based on the available data. It does not generate rows for months where no payments were received, as that would require generating data not directly present in the source collection, adhering to the rule of using the most straightforward interpretation.",30.254146814346317,"# Step 1: Calculate the year-month string for each payment

    *   `by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_sales_amount` field calculated earlier, in descending order (highest sales first). `na_pos='last'` ensures any salespersons with a NULL or non-existent total sales amount are placed at the end.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` on the top 5 results to select and rename the specific fields requested: `_id` (renamed to `salesperson_id`), `first_name`, `last_name`, and the previously calculated `total_sales_amount`.",22.08147430419922,"# Calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson

2.  **`sp_first_name=first_name, sp_last_name=last_name`**: We select the first and last names, renaming them temporarily to avoid conflicts in the next step.
3.  **`recent_sales=sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 30)`**: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection and filter it to include only sales where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date (`'now'`) is less than or equal to 30. This filtered list is temporarily stored as `recent_sales`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second calculation based on the results of the first.
5.  **`first_name=sp_first_name, last_name=sp_last_name`**: We bring back the original requested field names for first and last name.
6.  **`total_sales_count=COUNT(recent_sales)`**: We count the number of sales records in the filtered `recent_sales` list for each salesperson.
7.  **`total_revenue_amount=SUM(recent_sales.sale_price)`**: We sum the `sale_price` from the filtered `recent_sales` list to get the total revenue for each salesperson within the last 30 days.
8.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_count.DESC())`**: We select the top 5 records from the `salesperson_performance` collection, ordering them in descending order based on the calculated `total_sales_count`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, it retrieves the associated customer's state (`customer.state`), the `sale_price`, and the customer's unique identifier (`customer._id`). These are stored in intermediate variables `cust_state`, `sale_price`, and `cust_id`.
2.  **`state_groups = sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: The sales data (`sales_info`) is then partitioned based on the customer's state (`cust_state`). This groups all sales records originating from the same state together. The name `state_sales` is assigned to these groups (sub-collections).
3.  **`state_metrics = state_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each state group created by the partition, this step calculates the required metrics:
    *   `state = cust_state`: Retrieves the state name from the partition key.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(state_sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within the current state's group (`state_sales`).
    *   `unique_customers = NDISTINCT(state_sales.cust_id)`: Counts the number of distinct customer IDs (`cust_id`) within the current state's group, giving the number of unique customers for that state.
4.  **`top_5_states_by_revenue = state_metrics.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: Finally, this selects the top 5 records from `state_metrics` based on the calculated `total_revenue`, sorting them in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This line defines a contextless expression to calculate the date exactly 3 months prior to the current date and time. This makes the subsequent filtering logic cleaner.
2.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each salesperson.
3.  **`first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`**: We select the first and last names of the salespersons.
4.  **`total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`**: For each salesperson, this accesses their `sales_made` sub-collection, filters these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is on or after the calculated `start_date_3_months_ago`, and then calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for these filtered sales. This gives the total revenue for the period.
5.  **`num_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`**: Similarly, this filters the `sales_made` for the specified period and counts the number of sales records found.

3.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`**: This condition checks if the payment occurred on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., 'Monday', 'Saturday') from the `payment_date`.

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the date range for the ""previous ISO week"".
    *   `start_of_current_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date (likely Monday, assuming ISO week configuration) of the current week based on the current timestamp (`'now'`).
    *   `start_of_prev_week=DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-7 days')`: Calculates the start date of the previous week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
    *   `end_of_prev_week=DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-1 day')`: Calculates the end date of the previous week (likely Sunday) by subtracting 1 day from the start of the current week.
2.  **`payments_in_prev_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only those records where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `start_of_prev_week` and `end_of_prev_week` (inclusive).
3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_in_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the filtered payments.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created.
    *   `by=(payment_date, payment_method)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on unique combinations of the payment date (effectively grouping by day) and the payment method.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the desired output for each group created by the partition.
    *   `payment_day=payment_date`: Selects the payment date for the group.
    *   `method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method for the group.
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments belonging to that specific day and payment method group. We refer back to `PaymentsReceived` within the `SUM` function as required after a `PARTITION`.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(payment_day.ASC(), method.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first by the payment day in ascending order and then by the payment method in ascending order.
6.  **`result = daily_totals_by_method`**: Assigns the final computed collection to the `result` variable.",27.682684898376465,"# Calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_data_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection and filters it to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023 using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: We then calculate three fields for these filtered sales:
    *   `customer_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: This calculates the starting date of the quarter for each sale. It uses nested `IFF` functions (similar to IF-ELSEIF-ELSE) based on the `MONTH(sale_date)`:
        *   If the month is 1, 2, or 3, it assigns ""2023-01-01"".
        *   If the month is 4, 5, or 6, it assigns ""2023-04-01"".
        *   If the month is 7, 8, or 9, it assigns ""2023-07-01"".
        *   Otherwise (months 10, 11, 12), it assigns ""2023-10-01"".
    *   `sale_amount=sale_price`: This makes the `sale_price` available under a new name, although it's not strictly necessary here as `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` in the next step refers back correctly.
3.  **`partitioned_sales = sales_data_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the intermediate `sales_data_2023` collection.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not used explicitly later).
    *   `by=(customer_state, quarter_start_date)`: Groups the sales records based on the unique combinations of the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  **`quarterly_sales_by_state = partitioned_sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs calculations on each partition group created in the previous step.
    *   `state=customer_state`: Selects the state (which is constant within each group).
    *   `quarter_start=quarter_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date (constant within each group).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records belonging to the current state/quarter group. It accesses `Sales.sale_price` referring to the original collection's field within the context of the partition.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(state.ASC(), quarter_start.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first alphabetically by state and then chronologically by the quarter start date.
6.  **`result = quarterly_sales_by_state`**: Assigns the final computed collection to the variable `result`.",32.64536094665527,"# Filter sales for the year 2023 and calculate the customer's state and the start date of the quarter for each sale.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it based on conditions related to their inventory snapshots.
2.  **`HAS(inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if each car has at least one record in its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` conditions.
3.  **`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023 & MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`**: This filters the snapshots to include only those taken in March 2023.
4.  **`is_in_inventory == True`**: This further filters the snapshots to include only those where the car was marked as being in inventory.
5.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`**: This is the crucial part for finding the *latest* snapshot.
    *   It ranks the snapshots *that meet the date and inventory criteria* for each car (`per=""Cars""`).
    *   The ranking is done by `snapshot_date` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the most recent snapshot gets rank 1.
    *   The condition `== 1` selects only the latest snapshot among those from March 2023 where the car was in inventory.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`**: For the cars that have a snapshot meeting all the conditions (i.e., they were in inventory in the latest snapshot taken for them in March 2023), we select their `_id` (aliased as `car_id`), `make`, `model`, and `year`.",43.50107192993164,"result = Cars.WHERE(
