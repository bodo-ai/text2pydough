**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. Inside the first `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Select the customer's `name` and assign it to `cust_name`.
    *   Calculate the total number of transactions for each customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)` and assign it to `total_txns`.
    *   Calculate the number of successful transactions by filtering `transactions_made` where the `status` is 'COMPLETED' and then counting them, assigning the result to `successful_txns`.
2.  **`.WHERE(total_txns >= 5)`**: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only those customers who have 5 or more total transactions (`total_txns >= 5`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: In the second `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Carry forward the `cust_name`.
    *   Calculate the `success_rate` by dividing `successful_txns` by `total_txns` and multiplying by 100.0 to get a percentage. We use `IFF(total_txns > 0, ..., 0.0)` as a safeguard against potential division by zero, although the preceding `WHERE` clause should already ensure `total_txns` is at least 5.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting customer records in ascending order based on their calculated `success_rate`.

This query efficiently calculates the required metrics for each customer, filters based on the transaction count threshold, computes the success rate, and orders the final output as requested, returning only the customer name and their success rate.","customer_success_rates = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies for easier reference within the query.
2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`**: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
4.  **`&`**: This is the logical AND operator, combining the email condition with the transaction condition.
5.  **`(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1)`**: This is the second condition:
    *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions made by each customer.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`active_customers_since_2023 = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `join_date >= '2023-01-01'`: Selects customers whose `join_date` is on or after January 1, 2023.
    *   `status == 'Active'`: Selects customers whose account `status` is 'Active'.
    The result `active_customers_since_2023` contains only the customers meeting both criteria.

2.  **`tac_per_country = active_customers_since_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This line takes the filtered customers and partitions (groups) them.
    *   `name=""country_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partitions created.
    *   `by=country`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `country` field. Customers from the same country will be in the same partition.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is applied to the result of the `PARTITION`. For each country group created by the partition:
    *   `customer_country=country`: Selects the `country` field (which is the partition key) and renames it to `customer_country` in the output.
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of `Customers` records within the current partition (i.e., the number of active customers who joined since 2023-01-01 for that specific country). This count is named `tac_count`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_limits = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `Broker` level to calculate the date boundaries for our analysis.
    *   `start_date_limit`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the day, 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')`.
    *   `end_date_limit`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. Transactions *before* this timestamp are included.
2.  **`transaction_info = date_limits.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection (inheriting the calculated `date_limits`) and filter them based on:
    *   `ticker.ticker_type == 'stock'`: Ensures we only consider stock transactions by checking the `ticker_type` of the associated `ticker`.
    *   `(date_time >= start_date_limit) & (date_time < end_date_limit)`: Filters transactions to fall within the desired 8-week window (excluding the current week).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we calculate two new fields for each relevant transaction:
    *   `transaction_week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Creates a boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`.
4.  **`weekly_stock_stats = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `transaction_info` collection.
    *   `name=""weeks""`: Names the partition groups.
    *   `by=(transaction_week_start)`: Groups the transactions based on the calculated `transaction_week_start`, effectively grouping them by week.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each weekly partition group, we calculate the required statistics:
    *   `week_start_date = transaction_week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (the partition key).
    *   `total_stock_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions belonging to that specific week's partition group.
    *   `weekend_stock_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend)`: Sums the `is_weekend` flag for all transactions within the partition group. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0, this effectively counts the weekend transactions for that week.
6.  **`result = weekly_stock_stats.ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are ordered chronologically by the `week_start_date` and assigned to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE the start and end dates for the 8-week window preceding the current week

1.  **Identify the Goal:** We need to find the total number of transactions and the total transaction amount for customers located in the ""USA"" that occurred specifically during the *previous* week (not the current week).

2.  **Collections & Fields:**
    *   `Customers`: We need the `country` field to filter for ""USA"".
    *   `Transactions`: We need `date_time` to filter by date, `amount` for the sum, and the link back to `customer` to check their country.

3.  **Date Logic (""Last Week""):**
    *   We need to define the start and end of ""last week"".
    *   `start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`
    *   `start_of_last_week = DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-7 days')`
    *   A transaction falls within last week if its `date_time` is greater than or equal to `start_of_last_week` AND less than `start_of_current_week`.

4.  **Filtering Steps:**
    *   Filter `Transactions` where the associated `customer.country` is ""USA"".
    *   Filter `Transactions` where the `date_time` falls within the calculated range for last week.

5.  **Aggregation:**
    *   Count the number of filtered transactions.
    *   Sum the `amount` of the filtered transactions.
    *   Since we need overall totals, a final `CALCULATE` on the top-level `Broker` graph is appropriate.

```python
# Define the start of the current week and the start of the previous week
start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')
start_of_last_week = DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-7 days')

result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions = COUNT(us_transactions_last_week),
    total_transaction_amount = SUM(us_transactions_last_week.amount)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`**: This defines the timestamp representing the beginning of the current week (e.g., the most recent Sunday or Monday at 00:00:00, depending on system configuration).
2.  **`start_of_last_week = DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-7 days')`**: This calculates the timestamp representing the beginning of the week *before* the current one by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
3.  **`us_transactions_last_week = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   **`customer.country == ""USA""`**: It checks if the `country` field of the `customer` linked to the transaction is exactly ""USA"".
    *   **`(date_time >= start_of_last_week) & (date_time < start_of_current_week)`**: It checks if the transaction's `date_time` falls within the calculated range for the previous week (inclusive of the start, exclusive of the end, which is the start of the current week).
4.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs the final aggregation on the top-level `Broker` graph:
    *   **`num_transactions = COUNT(us_transactions_last_week)`**: It counts the number of transactions that met the filtering criteria.
    *   **`total_transaction_amount = SUM(us_transactions_last_week.amount)`**: It sums the `amount` field for all transactions that met the filtering criteria.

2.  **`customer_rankings = customer_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Takes the intermediate `customer_stats` collection as input.

    *   `customer_name=customer_name`, `num_transactions=num_transactions`, `total_transaction_amount=total_transaction_amount`: These lines pass through the fields calculated in the previous step.
    *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the rank for each customer based on their `total_transaction_amount`.
        *   `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_transaction_amount` field in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1).
        *   The result of the ranking is assigned to the `CR` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is 'BUY' and the transaction `date_time` occurred within the last 10 days from the current time (`DATETIME('now')`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10` calculates the difference in days between the transaction date and now, keeping those less than or equal to 10.
2.  **`transactions_with_symbol`**: This takes the filtered transactions and uses `CALCULATE` to add a new field `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` record.
3.  **`ticker_groups`**: This uses `PARTITION` to group the `transactions_with_symbol` records based on their `ticker_symbol`. Each group represents a unique ticker symbol found in the filtered transactions.
4.  **`ticker_buy_counts`**: This applies `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `ticker_symbol` group, it calculates `num_buy_transactions` by counting the number of original `Transactions` records that fall into that specific group (partition). It also includes the `ticker_symbol` itself in the output.
5.  **`result`**: This applies `TOP_K` to the `ticker_buy_counts`. It selects the top 2 records ordered by `num_buy_transactions` in descending order (`DESC()`), effectively giving the 2 ticker symbols with the most 'BUY' transactions in the specified period. The final result contains the `ticker_symbol` and `num_buy_transactions` for these top 2 symbols.","# Filter transactions to include only 'BUY' types within the last 10 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_range = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the relevant time window.
    *   `current_month_start` calculates the first moment of the current month.
    *   `six_months_ago_start` calculates the first moment of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. This defines the start of our 6-month period.
2.  **`customers_in_range = date_range.Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause selects customers whose `join_date` falls within the calculated 6-month window (greater than or equal to the start of 6 months ago, and less than the start of the current month).
    *   `CALCULATE(signup_month=...)` creates a new field `signup_month` in the format ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2024-01"") based on the customer's `join_date`. This will be used for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month is always two digits (e.g., ""01"" instead of ""1"").
3.  **`monthly_stats = customers_in_range.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered customers.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(signup_month))` groups the `customers_in_range` based on the `signup_month` calculated previously.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `signup_month=signup_month`: We select the month identifier.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` records within that specific month's partition group.
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction amount (PMAT) by taking the average of the `amount` from *all* transactions (`transactions_made`) associated with the customers who signed up in that specific month.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`**: The results are sorted chronologically by the signup month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Recent Prices:** We start with the `DailyPrices` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only records where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') <= 6`.
2.  **Calculate Necessary Fields:** Within the same step, we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Store the `close` price in a new field `price_close` for later averaging.
    *   Retrieve the `ticker_type` by navigating the relationship (`ticker.ticker_type`) and store it as `type_ticker`. This field is needed for grouping.
3.  **Partition by Ticker Type:** We then use `PARTITION` on the filtered and calculated data (`recent_prices_data`). We group the records by the `type_ticker` field, naming the partitions `type_groups`.
4.  **Calculate Average Closing Price:** Finally, we apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned result (`ticker_type_groups`). For each group (each unique `ticker_type`):
    *   We select the `ticker_type` (using the partition key `type_ticker`).
    *   We calculate the Average Closing Price (`ACP`) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `price_close` field of the records belonging to that specific ticker type group.
5.  **Result:** The `acp_results` variable holds the final output, containing each distinct `ticker_type` found in the last 7 days of data and its corresponding Average Closing Price (`ACP`).","import datetime

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_joined_2022 = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`**: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the year 2022.
2.  **`country_groups = customers_joined_2022.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=country)`**: This partitions the filtered customers based on their `country`. Each partition (`country_group`) will contain all customers from a specific country who joined in 2022.
3.  **`ar_by_country = country_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs calculations for each country partition.
    *   `country=country`: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
    *   `active_customer_count = COUNT(Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`: Counts the number of customers *within the current country partition* who have at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This represents the ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" for that country and join year.
    *   `total_customer_count = COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the total number of customers *within the current country partition*. This represents the ""Total Number of Customers"" for that country and join year.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio using the formula `(active_customer_count / total_customer_count) * 100.0`. The `IFF` function is used to prevent division by zero errors by checking if `total_customer_count` is greater than 0. If it is 0, AR is set to 0.0; otherwise, the calculation proceeds. `100.0` ensures floating-point division for a percentage result.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the calculation at the top-level `Broker` graph because we need a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_customers = COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_customers` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function. `COUNT` will count the number of records in the collection provided to it.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause to select only the customers meeting the specified criteria.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is used on both the `name` and `state` fields to ensure the comparisons are case-insensitive as requested.
5.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the name condition:
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a customer matches if *either* condition is true.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
7.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name condition group and the state condition. A customer is only included in the count if *both* the name condition (starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez') AND the state condition (ends with 'a') are met.
8.  The `COUNT` function then counts how many `Customers` records remain after applying these filters.","customer_count_result = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`one_month_ago = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`**: Defines a variable `one_month_ago` holding the timestamp exactly one month before the current time. This is used to filter transactions within the desired time window.
2.  **`Tickers.PARTITION(name=""ticker_group"", by=(symbol))`**: Groups the `Tickers` collection by their `symbol`. Each group represents a unique ticker symbol.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: Within each ticker group:
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the ticker symbol for the group.
    *   `relevant_sell_transactions = transactions_of.WHERE(...)`: Filters the transactions associated with the current ticker (`transactions_of`). It keeps only transactions where `transaction_type` is 'SELL' and the `date_time` is on or after `one_month_ago`. The result is stored in `relevant_sell_transactions`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: Operates on the result of the first `CALCULATE`:
    *   `ticker_symbol=ticker_symbol`: Passes the ticker symbol through.
    *   `total_amount_from_sells=SUM(relevant_sell_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions in `relevant_sell_transactions`.
    *   `total_costs=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of `tax` plus `commission` for all transactions in `relevant_sell_transactions`. An inner `CALCULATE` is needed here because `SUM` operates on a single expression, so we first calculate `txn_cost = tax + commission` for each relevant transaction and then sum `txn_cost`.
5.  **`.WHERE(total_amount_from_sells > 0)`**: Filters out any ticker groups where the `total_amount_from_sells` is zero or negative. This prevents division by zero errors in the SPM calculation and excludes cases with no relevant sell activity.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (third)**: Performs the final SPM calculation for the remaining ticker groups:
    *   `ticker_symbol=ticker_symbol`: Selects the ticker symbol.
    *   `selling_profit_margin=(...)`: Calculates the SPM using the formula provided: `(Total Amount - Total Costs) / Total Amount * 100.0`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage value.
7.  **`result = ticker_spm_calculation`**: Assigns the final collection containing `ticker_symbol` and `selling_profit_margin` to the `result` variable.","# Define the start date for the time window (one MONTH ago from now)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a formatted month string (`YYYY-MM`), retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker`, and keeps the necessary price fields (`close`, `high`, `low`) and the original `date` for later use. Fields are renamed (`close_price`, `high_price`, `low_price`, `price_date`) to avoid potential naming conflicts.
2.  **`ticker_months = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data first by `symbol` and then by the calculated `month_str`. This creates groups where each group contains all the daily price records for a single ticker within a single month.
3.  **`monthly_stats = ticker_months.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each ticker-month group, it calculates the average closing price (`avg_close`), the maximum high price (`max_high`), and the minimum low price (`min_low`) using aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) on the `DailyPrices` within that group. It also extracts the numerical `year_num` and `month_num` from the earliest date in the group, which are needed for correct chronological sorting when using the `PREV` function later.
4.  **`result = monthly_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is the core step for calculating the Month-over-Month Change (MoMC).
    *   It keeps the `symbol`, renames `month_str` to `month`, and keeps the calculated `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`.
    *   It uses the `PREV(avg_close, by=(year_num.ASC(), month_num.ASC()), per=""symbol"", default=None)` function. This looks at the previous record within the *same symbol* partition (`per=""symbol""`), ordered chronologically by year and month (`by=(year_num.ASC(), month_num.ASC())`), and retrieves its `avg_close` value. If there's no previous record (i.e., the first month for a ticker), it defaults to `None`.
    *   It calculates `momc` using the formula `(current - previous) / previous`. The `IFF` function ensures this calculation only happens if `prev_avg_close` is not `None` and not zero, preventing errors. Otherwise, `momc` is set to `None`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the columns requested in the output (`symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, `momc`), discarding intermediate fields like `year_num`, `month_num`, and `prev_avg_close`.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(...)`**: Finally, the results are ordered alphabetically by ticker symbol (`symbol.ASC()`) and then chronologically by year and month (`year_num.ASC(), month_num.ASC()`) for presentation.","# Step 1: Prepare daily price data with MONTH string, symbol, and necessary price/date fields

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter by Date:** The query starts by filtering the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records where the `date` falls between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023, inclusive.
2.  **Add Ticker Symbol and Prices:** It then uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `ticker.symbol` (making it available for partitioning) and the `high` and `low` prices for each relevant day.
3.  **Partition by Ticker:** The `PARTITION` function groups the filtered daily price records by `ticker_symbol`. This creates groups, where each group contains all the daily price records for a single stock within the specified date range.
4.  **Calculate Price Range:** Within each ticker's group (`ticker_data`), another `CALCULATE` is used. `MAX(ticker_data.high_price)` finds the highest high price recorded for that stock during the period, and `MIN(ticker_data.low_price)` finds the lowest low price. The difference between these two values (`price_change`) represents the total price range for that stock over the specified days.
5.  **Select Top 3:** `TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())` selects the three ticker groups that have the largest calculated `price_change`.
6.  **Final Output:** The final `CALCULATE` selects only the `ticker_symbol` and the corresponding `price_change` for the top 3 stocks, presenting the desired result.","import datetime

Using `< ""2023-04-01""` ensures that all timestamps on March 31, 2023, are included.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on their `transaction_type`. Each group contains all transactions of a specific type within the date range.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition group created in the previous step.
    *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`: Selects the transaction type (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: Calculates the number of unique customer IDs (`customer_id`) within each transaction type group. `NDISTINCT` counts the distinct values, and `Transactions.customer_id` refers to the customer IDs from the transactions belonging to the current group.
    *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: Calculates the average number of shares (`shares`) for all transactions within each transaction type group.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (one row per transaction type with its metrics) and selects the top 3 rows based on the `num_distinct_customers` field in descending order (highest count first).

2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(transactions_made) == 1)`**: We filter this collection. The `HASNOT(transactions_made)` function checks if the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which links customers to their transactions) is empty for each customer. The `== 1` ensures we keep only those customers for whom this condition is true (i.e., they have no transactions).

    *   `_id` is selected and renamed to `customer_id`.

2.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(transaction_type == 'BUY')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: We access the list of transactions linked to each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(transaction_type == 'BUY')`: We filter these linked transactions to keep only those where the `transaction_type` is 'BUY'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the filtered list of 'BUY' transactions for a customer is not empty (i.e., contains at least one record). The `== 1` explicitly checks for True.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: For the customers who satisfy the `WHERE` condition (meaning they have made at least one 'BUY' transaction), we use `CALCULATE` to select their unique identifier. The `_id` field in the `Customers` collection serves as the customer ID. We rename it to `customer_id` in the output.

2.  **`state_ticker_combinations = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection into groups based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. Each group is named `combinations`.
3.  **`combination_counts = state_ticker_combinations.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each unique combination (group), it calculates:

**1. Analyze the Request:**

*   **Goal:** Find the top 5 countries based on the number of customers in each.
*   **Input Data:** We need customer data, specifically their country. This points to the `Customers` collection.
*   **Operation:**
    *   Group customers by their `country`.
    *   Count the number of customers within each country group.
    *   Order the countries by this count in descending order.
    *   Select the top 5 countries.
*   **Output:** Return the `country` name and the `num_customers` for each of the top 5.

**2. Identify Collections and Fields:**

*   Collection: `Customers`
*   Fields: `country` (for grouping), `_id` or the collection itself for counting.

**3. Choose PyDough Constructs:**

*   **Grouping:** `PARTITION` is the appropriate function to group customers by `country`.
*   **Counting:** `COUNT(Customers)` within the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` will count the customers in each group.
*   **Ranking/Selecting Top K:** `TOP_K` is the correct function to get the top 5 based on the count.
*   **Selecting Output:** `CALCULATE` will select the final fields (`country` and the calculated count).

**4. Draft the PyDough Code:**

```python
# Partition customers by country and count them
country_customer_counts = Customers.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(
    country_name=country,          # Select the country name (using the partition key)

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Recent Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only transactions created within the last 30 days. `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 30` achieves this by calculating the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` timestamp and the current time ('now') and keeping those where the difference is 30 days or less.
2.  **Determine Sender Country:** We use `CALCULATE` to create a new field `sender_country`. Since the sender can be either a User (`sender_type == 1`) or a Merchant (`sender_type == 2`), we use the `IFF` function to check the `sender_type` and retrieve the `country` from the appropriate linked collection (`sending_user` or `sending_merchant`). We also keep the transaction `amount` under the new name `tx_amount` for later summation.
3.  **Partition by Country:** The `PARTITION` function groups the filtered transactions (`transactions_with_country`) based on the `sender_country`. Each group in the partition represents a unique country.
4.  **Calculate Aggregates:** After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` again on the grouped data. For each country group (`country_partition`), we calculate:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country (which is the partition key `sender_country`).
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of transactions within that country group, obtained using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `total_amount`: The sum of all transaction amounts (`tx_amount`) within that country group, obtained using `SUM(Transactions.tx_amount)`.
5.  **Select Top 5:** Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=total_amount.DESC())` on the aggregated results to select the 5 countries with the highest `total_amount`, ordered in descending order.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final result containing the top 5 countries with their name, transaction count, and total transaction amount is assigned to the variable `result`.","# Step 1: Filter transactions within the last 30 days (inclusive)
# CALCULATE the start date for the 30-DAY window

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these records based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is exactly 'VTI'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 7`: It calculates the difference in days between the record's `date` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`). It keeps only records where this difference is 7 days or less, effectively selecting prices from the last 7 days (inclusive of today).
2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates a final result at the top `Broker` graph level.
    *   `lowest_vti_close_last_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`: It defines a new field `lowest_vti_close_last_7_days`. The value assigned is the result of the `MIN()` aggregation function applied to the `close` field of the previously filtered `vti_prices_last_7_days` collection. This finds the minimum closing price among all the 'VTI' records from the last 7 days.

The final `result` variable will contain a single record with one field: `lowest_vti_close_last_7_days`, holding the lowest closing price for VTI in the specified period.","# Filter DailyPrices for the 'VTI' ticker within the last 7 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the query from the top-level `Ewallet` graph because we need a single aggregated result (the total count of transactions) across the relevant part of the database.
2.  **`num_transactions_recent_users=COUNT(...)`**: This defines the output field `num_transactions_recent_users` and assigns it the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We are counting records from the `Transactions` collection, but only those that meet the specified filter criteria defined within the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sending_user.created_at, 'now') <= 70`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each transaction:
    *   It accesses the related `sending_user` record via the `sending_user` relationship.
    *   It retrieves the `created_at` timestamp for that user.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", ..., 'now')` calculates the difference in days between the user's creation date and the current date/time (`'now'`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those customers for whom the condition `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` is true. `HAS(transactions_made)` checks if the `transactions_made` sub-collection (linking to the `Transactions` collection) is not empty for a given customer. This effectively filters out customers who have never made any transactions. The result is assigned to `active_customers`.
2.  **`active_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the filtered `active_customers` collection and calculates new fields for each customer record.
3.  **`customer_id=_id`**: This selects the customer's unique identifier (`_id`) and renames it to `customer_id` in the output.
4.  **`join_to_first_tx_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: This calculates the time difference.
    *   `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: For each customer, this finds the minimum (earliest) `date_time` among all their transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection. This represents the date of their first transaction.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference between two dates in the specified unit (""days""). It takes the customer's `join_date` as the start date and the result of the `MIN()` function (the first transaction date) as the end date.
    *   The result of the `DATEDIFF` calculation is assigned to the field `join_to_first_tx_days`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This condition ensures we only consider customers who have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that meets the inner criteria.
3.  **`transaction_type == 'SELL'`**: Filters the customer's transactions to include only 'SELL' types.
4.  **`DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day') == '2023-04-01'`**: Filters the transactions further to include only those that occurred on April 1st, 2023. We use `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` to truncate the timestamp to midnight, allowing for a direct date comparison with the string '2023-04-01'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`q1_completed_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Transactions` collection. It then filters these transactions based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `status == 'COMPLETED'`: Includes only transactions marked as completed (assuming 'COMPLETED' signifies successful transactions).
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions within the first quarter (January, February, March).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(year_month_str=...)`**: For the filtered transactions, this calculates a new field `year_month_str`.
    *   `JOIN_STRINGS('-', YEAR(date_time), LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, '0'))`: This creates a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., '2023-01'). `LPAD` ensures the month part is always two digits (e.g., '01' instead of '1'), which helps with correct sorting.
3.  **`monthly_average_prices = q1_completed_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered and calculated data and partitions it.
    *   `name='monthly_groups'`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` here).
    *   `by=(year_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of the `year_month_str` field calculated previously.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(month=..., average_price=...)`**: This operates on each partition group (each month).
    *   `month=year_month_str`: Selects the partitioning key (the 'YYYY-MM' string) and renames it to `month`.
    *   `average_price=AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all original `Transactions` records belonging to the current partition group (month).
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Sorts the final result chronologically based on the `month` string in ascending order (e.g., '2023-01', '2023-02', '2023-03').

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates for our target time window.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` calculates the end date by finding the start of the current week and going back one day (i.e., the last day of the previous week).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')` calculates the start date by finding the start of the current week and going back exactly 8 weeks. This defines the beginning of our 8-week analysis period.

2.  **`filtered_payments = date_boundaries.Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start from the `Sales` collection linked via `date_boundaries`.
    *   `.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`: Filters sales records to include only those where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
    *   `.payment`: Accesses the related `PaymentsReceived` records for these high-value sales.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_date_limit) & (payment_date <= end_date_limit))`: Filters these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated 8-week window (last 8 full weeks before the current one).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered payment, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `payment_week_start=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the calendar week the payment belongs to. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_payment=ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: Creates a boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday using the `DAYNAME` function.

3.  **`weekly_summary = filtered_payments.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_payments` collection.
    *   `name=""weekly_groups"", by=payment_week_start`: Groups the payments based on the `payment_week_start` date calculated previously. Each group represents a unique week within our 8-week window.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each weekly group created by the partition:
    *   `week=payment_week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (the partition key).
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(filtered_payments)`: Counts the total number of payment records within that specific weekly group.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(filtered_payments.is_weekend_payment)`: Sums the `is_weekend_payment` flag (where True=1, False=0) for all payments in the group, effectively counting how many payments occurred on a weekend within that week.

5.  **`.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results based on the `week` start date in ascending chronological order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`thirty_days_ago = DATETIME('now', '-29 days', 'start of day')`**: This line defines a contextless expression to calculate the date 29 days before the current date, truncated to the start of that day (midnight). This effectively sets the beginning of our 30-day window (inclusive of today).
2.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to select and compute the required fields for each salesperson.
3.  **`salesperson_id=_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`**: These select the salesperson's ID, first name, and last name, renaming `_id` to `salesperson_id` for clarity.
4.  **`num_sales_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= thirty_days_ago))`**: This calculates the number of sales for each salesperson within the desired timeframe.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with the current salesperson.
    *   `.WHERE(sale_date >= thirty_days_ago)`: Filters these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is on or after the calculated `thirty_days_ago` date.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales that satisfy the date filter.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(num_sales_last_30_days.DESC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection of salespersons in descending order based on the `num_sales_last_30_days` count, placing those with the most recent sales first.
6.  **`result = salesperson_recent_sales`**: The final computed and sorted collection is assigned to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE the start date for the 30-DAY window (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Cars` collection. It then filters these cars based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`: This checks if the `vin_number` contains the substring 'M5'. `UPPER()` is used to make the comparison case-insensitive, and the `%` wildcards allow 'M5' to appear anywhere within the VIN.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This ensures that only cars with at least one associated sale record are included.

2.  **`sales_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered `cars_with_m5_vin` collection and partitions it.
    *   `name=""model_group""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(make, model)`: Specifies that the cars should be grouped based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model`.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the group (which is the same for all cars within the group).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the group.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with *all* the `Cars` belonging to the current partition group (i.e., the specific make/model combination).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`toyota_sales_last_30_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line defines a contextless expression that filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == 'Toyota'`: It selects sales records where the associated car's `make` is 'Toyota'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: It further filters these sales to include only those that occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, ...)` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and today. `<= 29` ensures we capture today (0 days difference) and the preceding 29 days, totaling 30 days.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only Toyota sales within the specified date range are included.

2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations at the top `Dealership` level, aggregating results from the filtered sales.
    *   `num_sales = COUNT(toyota_sales_last_30_days)`: It counts the total number of sales records present in the `toyota_sales_last_30_days` filtered set.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(toyota_sales_last_30_days.sale_price)`: It sums the `sale_price` for all sales records within the `toyota_sales_last_30_days` filtered set, giving the total revenue.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_aggregates = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection. It uses `CALCULATE` to compute aggregate values for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name and assigns it to `sp_first_name`.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name and assigns it to `sp_last_name`.
    *   `total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` from all related `sales_made` records for each salesperson and assigns it to `total_sales`.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of `sales_made` records for each salesperson and assigns it to `num_sales`.

2.  **`ranked_salespersons = salesperson_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the intermediate result (`salesperson_aggregates`) and performs another `CALCULATE` operation:
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`: Renames `sp_first_name` back to `first_name` for the final output.
    *   `last_name=sp_last_name`: Renames `sp_last_name` back to `last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount=total_sales`: Renames `total_sales` to `total_sales_amount`.
    *   `number_of_sales=num_sales`: Renames `num_sales` to `number_of_sales`.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales.DESC())`: Calculates the rank (`SR`) for each salesperson based on the `total_sales` amount (calculated in the previous step) in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales get a lower rank number (e.g., rank 1 for the highest).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_status = Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and calculate intermediate fields for each car:
    *   `car_make=make`, `car_model=model`: Select the make and model.
    *   `has_sales = HAS(sale_records) == 1`: Create a boolean flag indicating if the car has at least one sales record.
    *   `latest_inventory_status = DEFAULT_TO(...)`: This determines the inventory status from the *most recent* snapshot.
        *   `inventory_snapshots.TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`: Selects the single latest snapshot based on `snapshot_date`.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Allows accessing the fields of this single snapshot.
        *   `.is_in_inventory`: Gets the boolean inventory status from that latest snapshot.
        *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., True)`: If a car has no inventory snapshots, `TOP_K` returns empty, `.SINGULAR()` results in null, and this defaults the status to `True` (in inventory), effectively excluding such cars later.

2.  **`relevant_cars = cars_with_status.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `cars_with_status` collection to keep only cars that meet both criteria:
    *   `has_sales == True`: The car must have been sold.
    *   `latest_inventory_status == False`: The car must not be in inventory according to its latest snapshot.

3.  **`grouped_sales = relevant_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `relevant_cars` based on their `car_make` and `car_model`. This groups all cars of the same make and model together.
    *   `name=""make_model_group""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(car_make, car_model)`: Specifies the fields to group by.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the final output fields for each make/model group:
    *   `make=car_make`, `model=car_model`: Include the make and model from the partition keys.
    *   `highest_sale_price = MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the maximum `sale_price` by looking at *all* `sale_records` associated with the `Cars` belonging to the current partition group (i.e., all sales for that specific make and model among the relevant cars).

5.  **`result = grouped_sales.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting make/model groups based on their calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first) and assign it to the `result` variable.","# Step 1: CALCULATE necessary information per car: make, model, whether it HAS sales,

1.  **Goal:** Find cars matching specific make ('Ford') or model ('Mustang') criteria (case-insensitive, partial match) and calculate their average sale price, returning specific car details.
2.  **Starting Point:** We need information about cars, so we'll start with the `Cars` collection.
3.  **Filtering:**
    *   We need to filter based on `make` or `model`.
    *   The match should be case-insensitive and partial. We'll use `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with `%` wildcards.
    *   The condition is `LOWER(make) LIKE '%ford%'` OR `LOWER(model) LIKE '%mustang%'`.
    *   We also need the average *sale* price, implying the car must have been sold at least once. We should add a check `HAS(sale_records) == 1`.
4.  **Calculations:** For each matching car, we need the average of `sale_price` from its `sale_records`. We'll use `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`.
5.  **Output:** We need `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, `vin_number`, and the calculated `avg_sale_price`.

```python
# Filter cars based on make ('Ford') or model ('Mustang') with case-insensitive partial matching,
# ensuring they have at least one sale record.
filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(
    (
        (LOWER(make).LIKE('%ford%')) | (LOWER(model).LIKE('%mustang%'))

    year=year,
    color=color,
    vin_number=vin_number,
    avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`.
2.  **`(LOWER(make).LIKE('%ford%')) | (LOWER(model).LIKE('%mustang%'))`**: This is the core filtering logic.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)` convert the car's make and model to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
    *   `.LIKE('%ford%')` checks if the lowercase make contains ""ford"" anywhere within it.
    *   `.LIKE('%mustang%')` checks if the lowercase model contains ""mustang"" anywhere within it.
    *   The `|` (OR operator) selects cars that match *either* the make condition *or* the model condition.
3.  **`& (HAS(sale_records) == 1)`**: This ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one corresponding record in the `Sales` collection (linked via `sale_records`). This is necessary because we need to calculate an average *sale* price.
4.  **`result = filtered_cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: We take the `filtered_cars` and use `CALCULATE` to select the desired output fields and compute the average sale price.
5.  **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These lines select the specified car details directly from the `Cars` collection.
6.  **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which contains linked `Sales` records) and applies the `AVG()` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field within those records.","# Filter cars based on make ('Ford') or model ('Mustang') with case-insensitive partial matching,

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Window:** We first define the time window using `DATETIME` functions. `start_date_window` is set to the beginning of the month 6 months prior to the current month. `end_date_window` is set to the beginning of the current month, effectively excluding it.
2.  **Filter Salespersons:** We filter the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 and 2023, inclusive, using the `YEAR` function and comparison operators.
3.  **Filter Sales and Calculate Month:** We access the `sales_made` sub-collection of the filtered salespersons. These sales are then filtered based on their `sale_date` to ensure they fall within the `start_date_window` (inclusive) and `end_date_window` (exclusive). We then use `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month` field in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent sorting and grouping. We also retain `sale_price` for the subsequent aggregation.
4.  **Partition by Month and Aggregate:** The resulting `sales_data` is partitioned using `PARTITION` with the `name` ""monthly\_sales\_group"" and grouped `by` the calculated `sale_month`. Within each partition group (each month), we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Output the `sale_month`.
    *   Calculate `pmsps` (Per Month Salesperson Sales count) by counting the `Sales` records in that group using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   Calculate `pmsr` (Per Month Sales Revenue) by summing the `sale_price` of the `Sales` records in that group using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
5.  **Order Results:** Finally, the `monthly_metrics` collection is ordered by `sale_month` in ascending order using `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())`.

*Note:* This query calculates metrics for months within the specified window *where sales actually occurred* for the selected salespersons. It does not explicitly generate rows with zero values for months within the window that had no sales, as generating a complete date series for zero-filling is typically done outside the core query logic or requires a dedicated calendar/date dimension table, which is not assumed here.","# Define the start and end dates for the 6-MONTH window (excluding the current MONTH)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only those records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  **`gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the calculation at the top `Dealership` level because we need a single, aggregated GPM value for all sales in 2023.
3.  **`total_revenue_2023 = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`**: Inside the first `CALCULATE`, this calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` for all sales filtered in the `sales_in_2023` variable.
4.  **`total_cost_2023 = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`**: This calculates the total cost by accessing the related `car` for each sale in `sales_in_2023` and summing their respective `cost` fields.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = IFF(...))`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
    *   **`IFF(total_cost_2023 != 0, ...)`**: This checks if `total_cost_2023` is not zero to prevent a division-by-zero error.
    *   **`(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`**: If the cost is not zero, this applies the GPM formula: (Revenue - Cost) / Cost, multiplied by 100.0 to express it as a percentage and ensure floating-point arithmetic.
    *   **`None`**: If the total cost *is* zero, the GPM is undefined, so we return `None`.
6.  **`result = gpm_calculation.CALCULATE(GPM_2023 = gpm_2023)`**: This final step selects only the calculated `gpm_2023` value and assigns it to the `result` variable under the name `GPM_2023`, fulfilling the request to return only the specific data asked for.","import pydough

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payments_with_month`**: We first process the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, we create a `month_key` string in the format 'YYYY-MM' using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure months like '01', '02' sort correctly). We also explicitly include `payment_amount` to make it available for the next step.
2.  **`monthly_totals`**: We partition the `payments_with_month` data using the `month_key`. For each unique month partition (named ""months""), we calculate the `total_monthly_payment` by summing the `payment_amount` of all original `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into that specific month's partition.
3.  **`monthly_analysis_with_prev`**: We take the `monthly_totals` (which now has one row per month with payment data). We use `CALCULATE` to rename `month_key` to `month` and `total_monthly_payment` to `total_payment`. Crucially, we use the `PREV` window function here. `PREV(total_monthly_payment, by=month_key.ASC(), default=0.0)` looks at the value of `total_monthly_payment` from the *previous* row within the `monthly_totals` collection, based on ascending `month_key` order. For the very first month chronologically, it returns the specified `default` value (0.0). This gives us `prev_month_total`.
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we perform another `CALCULATE` on `monthly_analysis_with_prev`. We keep `month` and `total_payment`, and compute the `mom_change` by subtracting the `prev_month_total` (calculated in the previous step) from the `total_payment`. The final result is then ordered by `month` in ascending order using `ORDER_BY`.

This query calculates the total payments for every month present in the `PaymentsReceived` data and the change from the preceding month. Months with no payments in the original data will not appear in the result.","# Step 1: CALCULATE the year-MONTH for each payment received record.

2.  **`tsc_last_7_days = ...`**: This defines the output field name for our result, representing the Total Sales Count for the last 7 days.
3.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This aggregation function counts the number of records in the collection provided to it.
4.  **`Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Sales` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE` to select only the sales records that meet the date criteria.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days that have passed between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   `<= 6` ensures we include sales from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago (6 days difference), covering the requested ""past 7 days, inclusive of today"".

The query filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made within the last 7 days (including today) and then counts how many such sales exist, assigning the result to `tsc_last_7_days`.","# CALCULATE the total count of sales from the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

**1. Analysis of the Request:**

*   **Goal:** Find the top 3 salespersons based on their Average Selling Price (ASP).
*   **Definition:** ASP = Total Sales Amount / Number of Sales.
*   **Output:** First name, last name, and ASP for the top 3.
*   **Data Needed:**
    *   Salesperson's first and last name (`Salespersons.first_name`, `Salespersons.last_name`).
    *   Sales records linked to each salesperson (`Salespersons.sales_made`).
    *   Sale price for each sale (`Salespersons.sales_made.sale_price`).
*   **Operations:**
    *   For each salesperson:
        *   Calculate the sum of `sale_price` from their `sales_made`.
        *   Count the number of sales in their `sales_made`.
        *   Calculate ASP using the provided formula.
    *   Rank the salespersons by the calculated ASP in descending order.
    *   Select the top 3.
    *   Return the requested fields.

**2. PyDough Code Generation:**

We'll start with the `Salespersons` collection. We need to calculate the total sales amount and the number of sales for each salesperson to compute their ASP. We should filter out salespersons with no sales to avoid division by zero and ensure we are ranking active sellers. Then, we use `TOP_K` to get the top 3 based on the calculated ASP.

```python
# Calculate ASP for each salesperson and find the top 3
top_salespersons_by_asp = Salespersons.WHERE(
    HAS(sales_made) == 1  # Ensure salesperson has made at least one sale
).CALCULATE(
    s_first_name=first_name,
    s_last_name=last_name,
    # Calculate Average Selling Price (ASP)
    # ASP = SUM(sales price) / COUNT(sales)
    avg_selling_price=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)
).TOP_K(
    3, by=avg_selling_price.DESC() # Get top 3 based on descending ASP
)

# Select only the requested fields for the final output
result = top_salespersons_by_asp.CALCULATE(
    first_name=s_first_name,
    last_name=s_last_name,
    ASP=avg_selling_price
)
```

**3. Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those who have made at least one sale (`HAS(sales_made) == 1`). This prevents potential division-by-zero errors when calculating ASP and focuses the ranking on active salespersons.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each salesperson who passed the filter:
    *   `s_first_name=first_name`, `s_last_name=last_name`: We select the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   `avg_selling_price=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: We calculate the Average Selling Price (ASP) according to the definition by summing the `sale_price` of all sales made by the salesperson (`SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`) and dividing it by the total number of sales they made (`COUNT(sales_made)`).
3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_selling_price.DESC())`**: We select the top 3 records from the calculated results, ordering them in descending order based on the `avg_selling_price` (ASP).
4.  **`result = top_salespersons_by_asp.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we perform another `CALCULATE` on the top 3 results to select and rename the fields exactly as requested: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ASP`.","# CALCULATE ASP for each salesperson and find the top 3

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection, as we want to find information *about* salespersons.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new values and select specific fields for each salesperson.
    *   `salesperson_id=_id`: Selects the unique identifier (`_id`) and names it `salesperson_id`.
    *   `first_name=first_name`: Selects the `first_name`.
    *   `last_name=last_name`: Selects the `last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson. It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` records for that salesperson) and sums up the `sale_price` for all those sales. The result is named `total_sales_amount`.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function selects the top 5 records from the result of the `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Specifies the sorting criteria. It sorts the salespersons based on the calculated `total_sales_amount` in descending order (`DESC`), meaning the highest sales amounts come first. `na_pos='last'` ensures that any salespersons with a NULL or undefined `total_sales_amount` are placed at the end of the sorted list, effectively excluding them from the top results unless there are fewer than 5 non-null results.","# CALCULATE the total sales amount for each salesperson and select the top 5

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start with the `Cars` collection, which contains information about all cars in the dealership.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    *   `sale_records` is the sub-collection linking cars to their sales records.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if this sub-collection is empty for a given car.
    *   `== 1` ensures we only keep cars where `HASNOT(sale_records)` is true (meaning the car has no sales records).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and renames the desired fields for the final output.
    *   `car_id=_id`: Selects the car's unique identifier and names it `car_id`.

1.  **Goal:** Get a distinct list of salesperson IDs (`_id` from the `Salespersons` collection) for those involved in at least one sale that received a cash payment.

3.  **Relationships:**
    *   `Salespersons` -> `Sales` (via `sales_made`)
    *   `Sales` -> `PaymentsReceived` (via `payment`)
4.  **Filtering Condition:** We need to find salespersons where at least one of their `sales_made` has at least one `payment` with `payment_method == 'Cash'`.
5.  **Strategy:**
    *   Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Use the `HAS` function to filter for salespersons who have made sales (`sales_made`).
    *   Within the `HAS` condition, navigate further to the `payment` sub-collection (representing `PaymentsReceived` linked to a specific sale).
    *   Filter these payments using `WHERE` to check if `payment_method == 'Cash'`.
    *   If the nested `HAS` condition is true (meaning such a cash payment exists for at least one sale by that salesperson), the salesperson is included.
    *   Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select only the `_id` of the filtered salespersons.

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection as the base, since we want to identify specific salespersons.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')) == 1)`**: This is the core filtering logic.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the condition inside the `HAS` function is true for the current salesperson.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with the salesperson.
    *   `.payment`: For each sale in `sales_made`, accesses the list of payments received for that sale.
    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')`: Filters these payments to only include those where the `payment_method` is exactly 'Cash'.
    *   The `HAS` function effectively checks: ""Does this salesperson have *any* sale for which there exists *any* payment record with the method 'Cash'?""
3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id)`**: After filtering, this selects only the unique identifier (`_id`) for each salesperson who met the criteria and renames it to `salesperson_id` in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.PARTITION(name=""model_groups"", by=(make, model))`**: This groups the `Cars` collection by unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group represents a specific car model.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates aggregate values for each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the make (partition key).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the model (partition key).
    *   `total_num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of sales records linked to all cars within the current make/model group. `Cars.sale_records` accesses the list of sales for each car in the group, and `COUNT` aggregates this across the group.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.PARTITION(name=""state_groups"", by=state)`: This groups the `Customers` collection based on the unique values in the `state` field. Each resulting group corresponds to a specific state.
2.  `.CALCULATE(state=state, total_signups=COUNT(Customers))`: For each state group created by the partition, this calculates:
    *   `state`: The name of the state (taken directly from the partition key).
    *   `total_signups`: The total number of customers belonging to that state group, effectively counting the signups for that state using `COUNT(Customers)`.
3.  `.TOP_K(2, by=total_signups.DESC())`: This selects the top 2 rows (states) from the result of the `CALCULATE` step. The selection is based on the `total_signups` field, ordered in descending order (`DESC()`), so the states with the highest signup counts appear first.","# PARTITION customers by state and count the number of customers (signups) in each state.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This line defines a variable `start_date_3_months_ago` that holds the timestamp exactly 3 months prior to the current execution time. This will be used to filter sales records.
2.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
3.  **`HAS(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago)) == 1`**: This condition inside `WHERE` ensures that we only consider salespersons who have at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) sale record (`sales_made`) where the `sale_date` is greater than or equal to the calculated `start_date_3_months_ago`. This effectively filters for sales within the last 3 months.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required metrics:
    *   `rep_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` of all sales (`sales_made`) that occurred within the last 3 months (filtered again by `sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago`).
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`: Counts the number of sales made by the salesperson within the last 3 months.
5.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated `total_revenue`, ordering them in descending order (highest revenue first).

).TOP_K(
    1,  # Select only the top 1 record

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(termination_date) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is present (not null). This ensures we only consider salespersons who have actually left the company.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates new fields or selects existing ones for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `salesperson_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates a full name by joining the `first_name` and `last_name` with a space.
    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the salesperson's phone number.
    *   `employment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date` in days, representing the total duration of employment.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`**: This selects the single record (`k=1`) that has the minimum value for `employment_duration_days`. The `.ASC()` ensures we are looking for the shortest duration (ascending order).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`weekend_payments_to_utility = PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `PaymentsMade` collection, which contains records of payments made by the dealership. It then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause to select only the payments that meet specific criteria.
2.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters the payments to include only those made to the vendor named 'Utility Company'.
3.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`**: This condition checks if the payment was made on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., 'Monday', 'Saturday') from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))` checks if the extracted day name is either 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.
4.  **`&`**: The ampersand (`&`) combines the two conditions, ensuring that only payments made to 'Utility Company' *and* on a weekend are selected.
5.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result. It uses `Dealership.CALCULATE` because we want a single aggregated value (the total count) across the filtered payments.
6.  **`num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(weekend_payments_to_utility)`**: Inside the `CALCULATE`, the `COUNT` function is used on the previously filtered `weekend_payments_to_utility` collection to count the number of records that satisfy the conditions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the boundaries of the *previous* ISO week using the `Dealership` high-level collection.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` determines the start date (Monday) of the *current* week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` calculates the start date (Monday) of the *previous* week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` calculates the end date (Sunday) of the *previous* week.
2.  **`payments_in_prev_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection from the context where the date boundaries are defined. We then filter these payments using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated `start_of_prev_week` and `end_of_prev_week`.
3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_in_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered payments.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_date, payment_method)`: Groups the payments first by the exact `payment_date` and then by the `payment_method`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group.
    *   `payment_date=payment_date`: Selects the date for the group.
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method for the group.
    *   `daily_total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments belonging to that specific date and payment method group. We refer back to `PaymentsReceived.payment_amount` to access the amounts within the partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Sales:** The code starts by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only sales that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
2.  **Calculate Quarter Start Date:**
    *   It calculates the quarter number (`quarter_num`) based on the `sale_date` month.
    *   A second `CALCULATE` is used to determine the first date of the quarter (`quarter_start_str`) as a string (e.g., '2023-01-01', '2023-04-01') using nested `IFF` functions based on the `quarter_num`.
    *   It also selects the customer's state (`cust_state = customer.state`) and the `sale_price` (renamed to `sale_amount`) for each sale.
3.  **Partition and Aggregate:**
    *   The `PARTITION` function groups the `sales_info` data first by the customer's state (`cust_state`) and then by the calculated quarter start date string (`quarter_start_str`).
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` following the `PARTITION`, it selects the partitioning keys (`customer_state=cust_state`, `quarter_start_date=quarter_start_str`).
    *   It then calculates the `total_quarterly_sales` for each group by summing the `sale_price` of the original `Sales` records that fall into that specific state and quarter partition using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
4.  **Order Results:** Finally, `ORDER_BY` sorts the results first alphabetically by `customer_state` and then chronologically by `quarter_start_date`.
5.  **Assign to Variable:** The final result set is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023
sales_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)

# Step 2: CALCULATE necessary fields including the quarter start date string

# Use nested IFF statements to determine the first date string of the quarter ('YYYY-MM-DD') based on the quarter number.
# Also retrieve the customer's state and the sale price for later aggregation.
sales_info = sales_2023.CALCULATE(
    cust_state=customer.state,
    sale_amount=sale_price,
    quarter_num=(MONTH(sale_date) - 1) // 3 + 1

**1. Analysis of the Request:**

*   **Goal:** Find cars that were marked as ""in inventory"" on the most recent inventory snapshot date within March 2023.
*   **Collections Involved:** `InventorySnapshots`, `Cars`.
*   **Filtering Criteria:**
    *   Snapshot date must be in March 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023` and `MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`).
    *   Among those March 2023 snapshots, we need the *latest* one (`MAX(snapshot_date)`).
    *   For snapshots on that latest date, the car must be in inventory (`is_in_inventory == True`).
*   **Output:** For the cars meeting these criteria, return their `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`.

**2. Step-by-step PyDough Logic:**

1.  Calculate the latest `snapshot_date` that falls within March 2023 across all snapshots. This requires a global calculation, starting from the `Dealership` level.
2.  Filter the `InventorySnapshots` collection to include only those records that:
    *   Match the calculated latest date from step 1.
    *   Have `is_in_inventory` set to `True`.
3.  From these filtered snapshots, navigate to the associated `car`.
4.  Select the required fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) from the resulting `Cars` collection.

**3. PyDough Code Generation:**

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the latest snapshot date within March 2023
latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    latest_march_date=MAX(
        InventorySnapshots.WHERE(
            (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) & (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3)
        ).snapshot_date
    )
)

# Step 2: Filter snapshots for that latest date where the car is in inventory
# Step 3: Access the associated car details
# Step 4: Select the required fields
cars_in_latest_snapshot = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(
    # Filter by the latest date calculated previously
    (snapshot_date == latest_march_date) &
    # Filter for cars marked as in inventory
    (is_in_inventory == True)
    # Access the related car record
).car.CALCULATE(
    # Select the requested car attributes, renaming _id for clarity
    car_id=_id,
    car_make=make,
    car_model=model,
    car_year=year
)

# Assign the final result to the 'result' variable
result = cars_in_latest_snapshot
```

**4. Explanation:**

1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Dealership` level to perform a global calculation. We find the maximum `snapshot_date` among all `InventorySnapshots` records where the year is 2023 and the month is 3 (March). This maximum date is stored in the variable `latest_march_date`.
2.  `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection again, but now within the context where `latest_march_date` is available.
3.  `.WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_march_date) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: We filter these snapshots to keep only those whose `snapshot_date` exactly matches the `latest_march_date` we calculated *and* where the `is_in_inventory` flag is `True`.
4.  `.car`: For the snapshots that pass the filter, we navigate to the associated `car` record using the relationship defined in the schema.
5.  `.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`: Finally, for each resulting car, we select its `_id` (renamed to `car_id`), `make` (renamed to `car_make`), `model` (renamed to `car_model`), and `year` (renamed to `car_year`).
6.  `result = cars_in_latest_snapshot`: The final collection containing the details of the cars found is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Step 1: CALCULATE the latest snapshot date within March 2023
latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection because we want to calculate a result for each drug.
2.  **`drug_name=drug_name`**: We select the `drug_name` field to include it in the final output.
3.  **`average_ddd=AVG(...)`**: We define a new field `average_ddd`. Its value is calculated by averaging the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) across relevant treatments for each drug.
4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: We access the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which links each drug to the treatments it was used in.
5.  **`.WHERE(end_dt != None)`**: We filter these treatments to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as specified in the DDD definition requirement.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we use another `CALCULATE` to compute the DDD for *each individual treatment* that passed the `WHERE` filter.
7.  **`ddd_per_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`**: This calculates the DDD for a single treatment according to the provided definition: total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) divided by the treatment duration in days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`).
8.  **`.ddd_per_treatment`**: After the inner `CALCULATE`, we access the computed `ddd_per_treatment` value. The `AVG` function then aggregates (averages) these individual DDD values for all valid treatments associated with the current drug.

This query effectively calculates the DDD for every applicable treatment and then computes the average of these DDD values for each drug, returning the drug name alongside its average DDD.","result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

)

# Order the results by month
result = monthly_patient_counts.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Period:** We first define the time window using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')` to get the start of the month three months prior to the current one, and `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the start of the current month. This defines the period covering the last three full months.
2.  **Filter Treatments:** We start with the `Treatments` collection and use `WHERE` to filter treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated `start_period` (inclusive) and `end_period` (exclusive).
3.  **Extract Information:** Using `CALCULATE`, we extract and format relevant information for each filtered treatment:
    *   `treatment_month`: Creates a 'YYYY-MM' string representation of the treatment start month using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure months like '01', '02' sort correctly).
    *   `patient_key`: Stores the `patient_id` for distinct counting later.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag set to `True` if the treatment's associated `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.
4.  **Partition by Month:** We use `PARTITION` to group the `treatment_info` records by the calculated `treatment_month`. Each partition (`month_data`) contains all treatment records for a specific month within our timeframe.
5.  **Calculate Distinct Counts:** We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data:
    *   `month`: Selects the `treatment_month` for the output.
    *   `distinct_patient_count`: Uses `NDISTINCT(month_data.patient_key)` to count the unique patient identifiers within each month's partition (`month_data`).
    *   `distinct_biologic_patient_count`: Filters the `month_data` sub-collection using `WHERE(is_biologic_treatment == True)` to get only biologic treatments for that month, and then applies `NDISTINCT` to the `patient_key` of this filtered subset to count unique patients who received biologic treatments in that month.
6.  **Order Results:** Finally, `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically by month.
7.  **Assign to Variable:** The final result set is assigned to the `result` variable.","# Define the start and end dates for the relevant period (last 3 months, excluding the current MONTH)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the query at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a field `num_patients` which will hold the result of the `COUNT` function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"") | ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")`**: This is the filter condition.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"")` checks if the `email` field ends with ""@gmail.com"".
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")` checks if the `email` field ends with ""@yahoo.com"".
    *   The `|` operator acts as a logical OR, so the `WHERE` clause selects patients whose email ends with *either* ""@gmail.com"" *or* ""@yahoo.com"".
5.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of `Patients` records that satisfy the `WHERE` condition.

2.  **`num_patients=NDISTINCT(...)`**: We define a field `num_patients` which will hold the final count. `NDISTINCT` is used to count the number of unique values.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter it based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`).
4.  **`(diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`**: This condition filters treatments linked to a diagnosis whose name is exactly 'Psoriasis vulgaris'. We access the diagnosis name via the `diagnosis` relationship from `Treatments`.
5.  **`(LOWER(drug.drug_type) == 'biologic')`**: This condition filters treatments linked to a drug whose type is 'biologic'. We use `LOWER()` to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive and access the drug type via the `drug` relationship.
6.  **`.patient.patient_id`**: After filtering the `Treatments` to only those meeting both criteria, we navigate to the associated `patient` for each matching treatment and select their `patient_id`. This results in a collection of patient IDs (potentially with duplicates if a patient had multiple qualifying treatments).
7.  **`NDISTINCT(...)`**: Finally, `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `patient_id` values from the filtered set, giving the total number of distinct patients who meet both the diagnosis and drug type criteria.","# CALCULATE the count of distinct patients diagnosed with 'Psoriasis vulgaris'

    *   `start_period=DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the month that started exactly 6 months before the current month. For example, if today is August 15th, 2024, this would calculate February 1st, 2024.
    *   `start_of_current_month=DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the current month. For example, if today is August 15th, 2024, this would calculate August 1st, 2024.
2.  **`alice_treatments_in_period = date_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection via the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_period` and `start_of_current_month` available). We then filter these treatments based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `patient.first_name == ""Alice""`: Filters for treatments associated with a patient whose first name is ""Alice"".
    *   `start_dt >= start_period`: Ensures the treatment's start date (`start_dt`) is on or after the beginning of the 6-month lookback period.
    *   `start_dt < start_of_current_month`: Ensures the treatment's start date is before the beginning of the current month, effectively excluding the current month.
3.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we perform a calculation at the top `DermTreatment` level.
    *   `alice_treatment_count_last_6_months=COUNT(alice_treatments_in_period)`: We use the `COUNT` aggregation function on the previously filtered `alice_treatments_in_period` collection to get the total number of treatments that met all the criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as the core request is about these events.
2.  **`.WHERE(treatment.drug.admin_route == 'Topical')`**: We filter these events. The condition navigates from the adverse event (`AdverseEvents`) to its associated `treatment` (`treatment`), then to the `drug` used in that treatment (`drug`), and checks if the `admin_route` of that drug is equal to `'Topical'`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select and rename the required fields for the final output:
    *   `event_description=description`: Selects the `description` field from the `AdverseEvents` collection and names it `event_description`.
    *   `treatment_identifier=treatment_id`: Selects the `treatment_id` field directly from the `AdverseEvents` collection (which links to the relevant treatment) and names it `treatment_identifier`.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctor_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This first step starts with the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it calculates:
    *   `doc_id`: The doctor's unique identifier.
    *   `speciality`: The doctor's medical specialty.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs`: The count of unique drug IDs found within the treatments prescribed by that doctor (`prescribed_treatments.drug_id`). `NDISTINCT` ensures each drug is counted only once per doctor, even if prescribed multiple times.

2.  **`result = doctor_drug_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: This second step takes the results from the first step (`doctor_drug_counts`) and calculates the final required fields:
    *   It carries forward `doc_id`, `speciality`, and the previously calculated `num_distinct_drugs`.
    *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""speciality"")`: This calculates the Specialty Drug Rank (SDRSDR).
        *   `RANKING(...)`: This is the window function used for ranking.
        *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: It ranks doctors based on the `num_distinct_drugs` field in descending order, meaning doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a lower rank number (rank 1 is the highest).
        *   `per=""speciality""`: This crucial argument tells the `RANKING` function to perform the ranking *within* each group of doctors sharing the same `speciality`. Doctors are only ranked against others in their own specialty.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each row represents a doctor and includes their ID, specialty, the count of distinct drugs they prescribed, and their rank within that specialty based on the drug count.","# Step 1: CALCULATE the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors`**: Starts with the `Doctors` collection, which contains information about all doctors.
2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the doctors based on the specified conditions.
    *   **`UPPER(first_name)` / `UPPER(last_name)`**: Converts the `first_name` and `last_name` fields to uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   **`STARTSWITH(UPPER(first_name), 'J')`**: Checks if the uppercase version of the doctor's first name starts with 'J'.
    *   **`CONTAINS(UPPER(last_name), 'SON')`**: Checks if the uppercase version of the doctor's last name contains the substring 'SON'.
    *   **`|`**: The logical OR operator combines the two conditions, so doctors matching *either* condition are included.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects and potentially renames the desired fields for the final output.
    *   **`doc_first_name=first_name`**: Selects the `first_name` field and assigns it to the `doc_first_name` variable in the result.
    *   **`doc_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the `last_name` field and assigns it to the `doc_last_name` variable.
    *   **`doc_specialty=speciality`**: Selects the `speciality` field and assigns it to the `doc_specialty` variable.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_range = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the time boundaries using the `DermTreatment` graph context.
    *   `current_month_start`: Calculates the first moment of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_period`: Calculates the first moment of the month that was 12 months prior to the `current_month_start` using `DATETIME(..., '-12 months')`. This defines the beginning of our 12-month window.

2.  **`treatments_in_range = time_range.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection through the `time_range` context (making `start_period` and `current_month_start` available).
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within our desired range: `>= start_period` and `< current_month_start`. This effectively selects treatments from the 12 full months preceding the current month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(treatment_year = YEAR(start_dt), treatment_month_num = MONTH(start_dt))`: We extract the year and month number from the `start_dt` for each filtered treatment, creating new fields `treatment_year` and `treatment_month_num`.

3.  **`monthly_groups = treatments_in_range.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `treatments_in_range` data.
    *   `name=""monthly_data""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not explicitly used later in this specific query, it's good practice).
    *   `by=(treatment_year, treatment_month_num)`: Groups the treatments based on the combination of the year and month they started in.

4.  **`monthly_stats = monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (each month) created by the partition, we calculate the final metrics.
    *   `year_month_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", treatment_year, LPAD(treatment_month_num, 2, ""0""))`: Creates a formatted string 'YYYY-MM' for the month (e.g., '2023-05'). `LPAD` ensures the month number has a leading zero if it's less than 10.
    *   `pmpd = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Calculates the Per Month Patient Diagnoses (PMPD) by counting the number of unique `patient_id`s within the `Treatments` belonging to that specific month's group.
    *   `pmtc = COUNT(Treatments)`: Calculates the Per Month Treatment Count (PMTC) by counting the total number of `Treatments` within that specific month's group.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to compute a new value based on the selected drug(s).
3.  **`average_weight_kg=AVG(treatments_used_in.patient.weight_kg)`**:
    *   `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments where the selected drug ('Drugalin') was used.
    *   `.patient`: For each of those treatments, it accesses the corresponding patient record.
    *   `.weight_kg`: It retrieves the `weight_kg` field from each of these patient records.
    *   `AVG(...)`: This aggregation function calculates the average of all the retrieved `weight_kg` values.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the calculation at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph because we want a single aggregated result (the average weight across a subset of patients).
2.  **`avg_male_weight_kg=AVG(...)`**: We define the output field `avg_male_weight_kg` and assign it the result of the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(gender == 'Male')`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we first access the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only patients whose `gender` is 'Male'.
4.  **`.weight_kg`**: We then specify the field `weight_kg` from the filtered male patients. The `AVG` function calculates the average of this field for the selected cohort.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_year`**: This first step identifies the year each patient had their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)` filters out patients who have never had any treatments.
    *   `CALCULATE(first_treatment_year=YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))` calculates a new field `first_treatment_year`. It finds the minimum `start_dt` across all `treatments_received` for a patient and extracts the `YEAR` from that date.

2.  **`yearly_new_patients`**: This step counts the number of new patients for each year.
    *   It takes the `patient_first_treatment_year` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year)` groups the patients based on the `first_treatment_year` calculated previously.
    *   `CALCULATE(year=first_treatment_year, num_new_patients=COUNT(Patients))` calculates the final fields for this intermediate step:
        *   `year`: The year of the first treatment (the partition key).
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of patients within that specific year group (i.e., the number of patients whose first treatment occurred in that `year`).

3.  **`result`**: This final step calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI).
    *   It takes the `yearly_new_patients` collection.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` sorts the yearly counts chronologically, which is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` computes the final output fields:
        *   `year`: The year.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of new patients for that year.
        *   `NPI`: Calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)` function retrieves the `num_new_patients` value from the immediately preceding row (when ordered by `year`). The `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the data, the NPI is calculated as `num_new_patients - 0`.","# Step 1: Find the year of the first treatment for each patient

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_outcomes`**: This intermediate step filters the `Outcomes` collection. It uses `WHERE` to keep only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (checked by comparing the field to itself, which is only true for non-null values). This ensures we only consider outcomes with valid data for both time points as required by the definition.
2.  **`average_scores`**: This step calculates the overall average PASI scores. It starts from the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to get a global perspective. It uses `CALCULATE` to compute two new fields:
    *   `avg_pasi_d7`: The average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `filtered_outcomes`.
    *   `avg_pasi_d100`: The average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `filtered_outcomes`.
3.  **`overall_d7d100pir`**: This final step calculates the D7D100PIR percentage based on the previously calculated averages.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` on the `average_scores` result (which is a single row).
    *   It applies the formula: `(avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0`.
    *   An `IFF` condition is added to check if `avg_pasi_d7` is zero to prevent division-by-zero errors. If it is zero, the result is set to `None` (or potentially 0 or another indicator depending on desired behavior).
    *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a floating-point percentage.
    *   The final output contains only the `d7d100pir_percentage` field as requested.","# Define a filtered collection of outcomes WHERE both DAY 7 and DAY 100 PASI scores are non-null

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start the query at the top level of the `DermTreatment` graph because we need a single aggregate count across all patients. `CALCULATE` is used here to compute a new value based on the entire graph's data.
2.  `pic_female_patients=...`: This assigns the result of the calculation to a field named `pic_female_patients`, following the definition provided (PIC = private insured patient count).
3.  `COUNT(...)`: This aggregation function counts the number of records within the collection provided to it.
4.  `Patients.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Patients` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause to select only the patients meeting specific criteria.
5.  `(gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private')`: This is the filtering condition. It selects records from the `Patients` collection where the `gender` field is equal to 'Female' AND (`&`) the `ins_type` field is equal to 'Private'. This ensures we only count patients who satisfy both conditions.","# CALCULATE the count of female patients with private insurance

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection because we want to aggregate results per drug.
2.  **`drug_identifier=drug_id, drug_full_name=drug_name`**: We select the `drug_id` and `drug_name` for each drug, renaming them to `drug_identifier` and `drug_full_name` respectively for clarity in the output.
3.  **`num_same_month_events=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_same_month_events` for each drug. This field counts the number of relevant adverse events associated with that drug.
4.  **`treatments_used_in.adverse_events.WHERE(...)`**: To get the count, we navigate from the current `Drug` record to its associated `Treatments` (via `treatments_used_in`), and then to the `AdverseEvents` associated with those treatments. We then apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these adverse events.
5.  **`(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each `AdverseEvent`, it checks if the year of its `reported_dt` matches the year of the `start_dt` of the `Treatment` it belongs to (`treatment.start_dt`), AND if the month of its `reported_dt` matches the month of the `treatment.start_dt`. This ensures we only count adverse events reported in the same calendar month and year as the treatment began.
6.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=num_same_month_events.DESC())`**: After calculating the count (`num_same_month_events`) for every drug, we use `TOP_K` to select only the single drug (`k=1`) that has the highest count. The `by=num_same_month_events.DESC()` clause specifies that the ranking should be based on this count in descending order (highest count first).

The final result assigned to `top_drug_by_adverse_events` will be a collection containing a single row with the `drug_identifier`, `drug_full_name`, and `num_same_month_events` for the drug that met the criteria most often.","# Find the drug with the most adverse events reported in the same MONTH/year as treatment start

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctors_prescribing_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Doctors` collection and filters it.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == ""biologic"")) == 1`: This condition checks if a doctor has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) entry in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause.
    *   `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == ""biologic"")`: This filters the treatments prescribed by the doctor, keeping only those where the associated `drug` has a `drug_type` equal to ""biologic"".
    *   The result `doctors_prescribing_biologics` contains only those doctors who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

2.  **`distinct_doctor_states = doctors_prescribing_biologics.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered doctors and partitions them.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered treatments, we calculate/extract three pieces of information:
    *   `p_id=patient.patient_id`: The unique ID of the patient associated with the treatment.
    *   `insurance_type=patient.ins_type`: The insurance type of the patient.
    *   `pasi_100=outcome_records.SINGULAR().day100_pasi_score`: The PASI score recorded at day 100 from the associated outcome record. `SINGULAR()` is used assuming there's only one relevant outcome record per treatment for the day 100 assessment.
3.  **`insurance_stats = treatment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `treatment_info` collection based on the `insurance_type`. This groups all treatment records belonging to the same insurance type together.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: For each insurance type group created by the partition:
    *   `ins_type=insurance_type`: We retain the insurance type name.
    *   `avg_pasi_100=AVG(treatment_info.pasi_100)`: We calculate the average of the `pasi_100` values (calculated in the previous step) for all treatments within that insurance group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients`**: We start with the `Patients` collection, which contains information about all patients.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1)`**: We filter this collection using the `WHERE` clause. The `HASNOT(treatments_received)` function checks if the `treatments_received` sub-collection (which links patients to their treatments) is empty for each patient. We keep only those patients for whom this condition is true (i.e., they have no associated treatments).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the requested fields: `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` for the filtered patients.
4.  **`inactive_patients = ...`**: The resulting collection of patients with no treatments is assigned to the variable `inactive_patients`.","inactive_patients = Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`**: Starts with the `Diagnoses` collection and filters it.
2.  **`HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas) == 1`**: This condition ensures that we only consider diagnoses that have at least one associated treatment (`treatments_for`) which in turn has at least one outcome record (`outcome_records`) where the `day100_itch_vas` score is recorded (not null). This avoids errors or skewed results from diagnoses with no relevant outcome data.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each diagnosis passing the filter, calculates new fields:
    *   **`diagnosis_name=diag_name`**: Selects the name of the diagnosis.
    *   **`num_patients=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`**: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the treatments (`treatments_for`) for the current diagnosis by accessing the `patient` linked to each treatment and getting their unique `patient_id`.
    *   **`max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`**: Finds the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score across all outcome records (`outcome_records`) linked to the treatments (`treatments_for`) for the current diagnosis.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))`**: Selects the top 3 diagnoses from the calculated results, ordered primarily by the `max_itch_score` in descending order (highest score first). `na_pos='last'` ensures that any diagnoses where `max_itch_score` might be null (though the `WHERE HAS` clause should prevent this) are placed at the bottom.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to calculate a reference date. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month. This defines the start of our time window.
2.  **`filtered_treatments = date_info.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter them using `WHERE` to include only those treatments whose `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `start_window_date`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(specialty=doctor.speciality, drug_amount=tot_drug_amt)`**: For the filtered treatments, we calculate (or make available) the `specialty` of the prescribing doctor (accessed via the `doctor` relationship) and the `tot_drug_amt` (renamed to `drug_amount` for clarity, though renaming isn't strictly necessary here). These fields are needed for partitioning and aggregation.
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""spec_group"", by=(specialty))`**: We partition the `filtered_treatments` collection into groups based on the unique values of the `specialty` field. Each group (`spec_group`) contains all treatments belonging to one specialty within the filtered set.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_specialty=specialty, num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments), total_drug_prescribed=SUM(Treatments.drug_amount))`**: For each specialty group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `doc_specialty=specialty`: The name of the specialty (using the partition key directly).
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments)`: The total number of treatments within that specialty group (counting the original `Treatments` records associated with the group).
    *   `total_drug_prescribed=SUM(Treatments.drug_amount)`: The sum of the `drug_amount` (originally `tot_drug_amt`) for all treatments within that specialty group.
6.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_prescribed.DESC())`**: We take the results from the previous step (one record per specialty with aggregated stats) and select the top 3 records based on the `total_drug_prescribed` field, sorting in descending order.
7.  **`result = top_specialties`**: The final result, containing the top 3 specialties and their corresponding treatment count and total drug amount, is assigned to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE the start date of the 6-MONTH window (start of 6 months ago)

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 drugs based on usage frequency (number of treatments) and average dosage amount per treatment.
2.  **Data Needed:**
    *   Drug names (`Drugs.drug_name`).
    *   Count of treatments per drug (`COUNT(Drugs.treatments_used_in)`).
    *   Average total drug amount per treatment for each drug (`AVG(Drugs.treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`).
3.  **Collections Involved:** `Drugs` and `Treatments`. The link is `Drugs.treatments_used_in`.
4.  **Operation:** We need to aggregate data per drug (count treatments, average amount) and then select the top 5 based on one of these metrics. The request mentions ""by number of treatments *and* average drug amount"", which is slightly ambiguous for sorting. Typically, this means sorting primarily by one criterion (usually the first mentioned, number of treatments) and potentially using the other as a tie-breaker, or just returning both metrics for the top 5 based on the primary sort key. We will sort by the number of treatments.
5.  **PyDough Steps:**
    *   Start with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   Filter out drugs not used in any treatments (optional but good practice).
    *   Use `CALCULATE` to compute `drug_name`, `num_treatments`, and `avg_drug_amount`.
    *   Use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 based on `num_treatments` in descending order.

```python

# then select the top 5 drugs based on the number of treatments.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in) == 1)`: Starts with the `Drugs` collection and filters it to include only drugs that are associated with at least one treatment record via the `treatments_used_in` relationship.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each drug that passed the filter, it calculates three fields:
    *   `drug_name = drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Counts the total number of treatments linked to this drug.
    *   `avg_drug_amount = AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`: Calculates the average of the `tot_drug_amt` field across all treatments linked to this drug.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())`: Selects the top 5 records from the result of the `CALCULATE` operation, ordered by the `num_treatments` field in descending order (highest count first).

)

# Count the number of treatments that meet all the specified criteria
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    count_of_treatments = COUNT(recent_psoriasis_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and apply filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions inside the `WHERE` must be true (`&` operator) for a treatment to be included.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This checks the linked `diagnosis` record for each treatment. It converts the `diag_name` to lowercase using `LOWER` and then uses `LIKE` with `%` wildcards to see if it contains the substring 'psoriasis'. This ensures a case-insensitive wildcard match.
3.  **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This checks the linked `drug` record. `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt)` returns true if the `fda_appr_dt` field exists and is not null for the drug used in the treatment, indicating it has an FDA approval date.
4.  **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the treatment record actually has an end date specified.
5.  **`end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`**: This compares the treatment's `end_dt` with a date calculated dynamically. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` computes the date exactly 6 months prior to the current moment the query is run. The condition selects treatments that ended on or after that date (i.e., within the last 6 months).
6.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the `Treatments` collection into `recent_psoriasis_treatments`, we use the top-level graph `DermTreatment` to perform a final calculation.
7.  **`count_of_treatments = COUNT(recent_psoriasis_treatments)`**: This counts the number of records remaining in the filtered `recent_psoriasis_treatments` collection and assigns the result to the field `count_of_treatments`.","# Filter treatments based on diagnosis name, drug FDA approval, and end date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(year_reg == (YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2))`**: This line filters the `Doctors` collection to include only those whose `year_reg` (year of registration) is exactly two years prior to the current year obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`.
2.  **`first_treatments_for_selected_doctors = doctors_registered_2_years_ago.prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`**: Starting from the filtered doctors, we navigate to their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection. The `WHERE` clause then filters these treatments.
3.  **`RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, `RANKING` is used as a window function.
    *   `by=start_dt.ASC()`: It ranks treatments based on their `start_dt` in ascending order (earliest first).
    *   `per=""Doctors""`: This crucial part ensures the ranking is done *independently for each doctor* from the parent `doctors_registered_2_years_ago` collection.
    *   `== 1`: We select only the treatment(s) with rank 1, which corresponds to the earliest treatment(s) for each doctor.
4.  **`result = first_treatments_for_selected_doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the collection of first treatments (one per relevant doctor) and selects the final output fields.
    *   `doc_last_name=doctor.last_name`: Accesses the last name of the doctor associated with the treatment via the `doctor` relationship.
    *   `registration_year=doctor.year_reg`: Accesses the registration year of the associated doctor.
    *   `first_treatment_date=start_dt`: Selects the start date of the treatment itself (which is the first treatment).
    *   `first_treatment_id=treatment_id`: Selects the ID of the treatment itself.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as each record represents an adverse event we need to evaluate.
2.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)`**: This function calculates the difference in full days between the start date of the associated treatment (`treatment.start_dt`) and the date the adverse event was reported (`reported_dt`).
3.  **`(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: This condition filters the adverse events to include only those where the `reported_dt` is on the same day as or up to 10 days *after* the `treatment.start_dt`. The `>= 0` ensures we don't include events reported *before* the treatment started.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we select and rename the required fields:
    *   `treatment_id=treatment.treatment_id`: Accesses the ID from the linked `treatment` record.
    *   `treatment_start_date=treatment.start_dt`: Accesses the start date from the linked `treatment` record.
    *   `adverse_event_date=reported_dt`: Selects the report date directly from the `AdverseEvents` record.
    *   `adverse_event_description=description`: Selects the description directly from the `AdverseEvents` record.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`qualifying_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `is_placebo == True`: It selects only treatments that are placebos.
    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)) == 1`: This is a crucial part. It checks if the treatment `HAS` at least one (`== 1`) record in its `concomitant_meds` sub-collection that meets the specified condition.
        *   `concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`: It filters the concomitant meds associated with the current treatment.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`: This calculates the difference in days between the treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`) and the concomitant medication's start date (`start_dt`). It keeps only those meds where the start date is within 14 days (inclusive) of the treatment start date. Note that `treatment.start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` field of the parent `Treatments` record.
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions, ensuring we only consider placebo treatments that have at least one concomitant med started within the first two weeks.

2.  **`result = qualifying_treatments.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the filtered `qualifying_treatments`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(treatment_id=treatment_id, treatment_start_date=start_dt, treatment_end_date=end_dt)`: It selects the `treatment_id`, `start_dt`, and `end_dt` from the qualifying treatments, renaming the date fields for clarity.

3.  **`.concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`**: This navigates into the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection *of the already filtered treatments*.
    *   `.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)`: It applies the *same* date difference filter again. This is necessary because the previous `HAS` check only confirmed existence; this step selects the *actual* concomitant med records that meet the criteria for each treatment.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` operates on the filtered concomitant meds.
    *   `treatment_id=treatment_id, treatment_start_date=treatment_start_date, treatment_end_date=treatment_end_date`: It inherits the treatment details calculated in the parent `CALCULATE` step.
    *   `concomitant_med_start_date=start_dt, concomitant_med_end_date=end_dt`: It selects the `start_dt` and `end_dt` from the filtered concomitant med records, renaming them for clarity.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patients_with_age = Patients.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Patients` collection. It uses `CALCULATE` to derive a new field `age_in_years` for each patient.
    *   `age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`: This calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`), effectively giving their current age in years.
    *   `patient_gender = gender`, `patient_ins_type = ins_type`: These lines simply carry forward the `gender` and `ins_type` fields into the `patients_with_age` intermediate collection, renaming them slightly to avoid potential conflicts and improve clarity.
2.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result using the top-level `DermTreatment` graph object, which is appropriate for calculating a single aggregate value over the database.
    *   `average_male_private_insurance_age = AVG(...)`: This calculates the average value and assigns it to the `average_male_private_insurance_age` field in the final result.
    *   `patients_with_age.WHERE(...)`: This takes the intermediate `patients_with_age` collection (which includes the calculated age) and filters it.
    *   `(patient_gender == 'Male') & (patient_ins_type == 'Private')`: This is the filter condition. It selects only those records where the `patient_gender` is 'Male' *and* the `patient_ins_type` is 'Private'. (Note: Assumes 'Private' is the correct string identifier for private insurance).
    *   `.age_in_years`: After filtering, this selects the `age_in_years` field from the remaining records.
    *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` function then computes the average of these selected `age_in_years` values.

The final `result` variable will hold a single record containing the average age (as an integer, since `DATEDIFF` in years returns an integer) of all male patients with private insurance.","# CALCULATE the age for each patient first

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Ewallet.Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection from the `Ewallet` graph, as we need to calculate CPUR for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_name=name`**: We select the merchant's name.
3.  **`successful_transactions=transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'Completed')`**: We create an intermediate calculation `successful_transactions` by filtering the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant, keeping only those with a `status` of 'Completed'.
4.  **`num_distinct_coupons=NDISTINCT(successful_transactions.coupon_id)`**: We calculate the number of unique coupons used within the `successful_transactions`. `NDISTINCT` counts the distinct non-null values of `coupon_id`.
5.  **`num_distinct_transactions=COUNT(successful_transactions)`**: We count the total number of `successful_transactions` for the merchant. Since each transaction has a unique ID, `COUNT` gives us the number of distinct successful transactions.
6.  **`CPUR=IFF(...)`**: We calculate the Coupon Usage Rate (CPUR).
    *   `IFF(num_distinct_transactions > 0, ...)`: We check if the merchant has any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons / num_distinct_transactions`: If there are successful transactions, we calculate CPUR by dividing the distinct coupon count by the distinct transaction count.
    *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions (`num_distinct_transactions` is 0), we assign a CPUR of 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate two key dates using the top-level `Ewallet` collection:
    *   `start_of_current_week`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week (e.g., the most recent Monday or Sunday, depending on configuration).
    *   `start_of_period`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week three weeks prior to the current week. This marks the start of our analysis window.

2.  **`relevant_notifications = date_boundaries.Users.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start from `Users` linked via the `date_boundaries` context (though the dates aren't directly used here yet, this structure allows access later if needed).
    *   `WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`: Filters users to include only those whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.
    *   `.notifications`: Accesses the notifications sent to these selected users.
    *   `.WHERE((created_at >= start_of_period) & (created_at < start_of_current_week))`: Filters these notifications to include only those created *on or after* the `start_of_period` and *before* the `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting notifications from the last three full weeks.

3.  **`notification_info = relevant_notifications.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `relevant_notification`, we calculate `notification_week_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`. This will be our grouping key.

4.  **`weekly_notification_counts = notification_info.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=(notification_week_start))`: Groups the `notification_info` records based on the calculated `notification_week_start`. Each group represents a specific week within our 3-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week_start_date=notification_week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications=COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all `Notifications` records belonging to this specific week's group.
        *   `weekend_notifications=COUNT(Notifications.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))))`: Counts only the `Notifications` within this week's group where the `DAYNAME` of their `created_at` timestamp is either 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.

    *   Sorts the final weekly counts based on the `week_start_date` in ascending order (oldest week first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`us_user_transactions_last_7_days = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection to isolate the specific transactions we are interested in.
    *   `sender_type == 1`: This condition ensures that the transaction was initiated by a user, as indicated by `sender_type` being 1 (based on the schema description).
    *   `sending_user.country == 'US'`: This accesses the `sending_user` relationship (linking to the `Users` collection) and checks if the `country` field for that user is 'US'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This calculates the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` timestamp and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition `<= 6` selects transactions from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago, effectively covering the last 7 days inclusive.
2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs the final aggregation on the top-level `Ewallet` graph context.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(us_user_transactions_last_7_days)`: This counts the total number of records within the previously filtered `us_user_transactions_last_7_days` collection and assigns it to the `num_transactions` field.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(us_user_transactions_last_7_days.amount)`: This sums the `amount` field for all transactions within the filtered `us_user_transactions_last_7_days` collection and assigns the result to the `total_transaction_amount` field.

The final `result` variable will contain a single record with two fields: `num_transactions` (the count) and `total_transaction_amount` (the sum).","# Define the set of relevant transactions by filtering the Transactions collection

1.  **`recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today and 7 days ago. It uses `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` to achieve this comparison.
2.  **`user_average_balances = recent_user_balances.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered balances (`recent_user_balances`) into groups based on the `user_id`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_amb=AVG(UserBalances.balance))`**: For each user group created by the partition, this calculates the average balance (`AVG(UserBalances.balance)`) using the balances from the original `UserBalances` collection that belong to that specific user within the filtered 7-day timeframe. This result is named `user_amb` (Average Monthly Balance, adapted here for the weekly timeframe per user).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_balance_record = Users.balances.WHERE(...)`**: We start by defining a reusable expression `latest_balance_record`. It operates on the `balances` sub-collection accessible from each `User`.
2.  **`RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: This ranks the balance records based on their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order, meaning the most recent date gets rank 1.
    *   `per=""Users""`: This crucial part ensures the ranking is performed independently *for each user*. It partitions the ranking calculation based on the parent `Users` collection.
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the balance record with rank 1 (the latest one for that specific user).
3.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `RANKING(...) == 1` filter guarantees that we select at most one balance record per user, we use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this result as a single record, allowing us to access its fields directly in the subsequent `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`result = Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We iterate through the `Users` collection.
5.  **`user_name=username`**: We select the `username` for each user.
6.  **`latest_user_balance=latest_balance_record.balance`**: For each user, we access the pre-defined `latest_balance_record` (which corresponds to that user's single latest balance record) and retrieve its `balance` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, it calculates three fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(...)`: Calculates the total revenue for the merchant. This is done by:
        *   Accessing `transactions_received`, which links to all transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
        *   Filtering these transactions using `.WHERE(status == 'Completed')` to include only successful transactions.
        *   Summing the `amount` of these filtered transactions using `SUM()`.

2.  **`merchant_mrr = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the results from the previous step (`merchant_revenues`) and calculates the final output fields:
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=merchant_category`: Keeps the merchant's category.
    *   `revenue_amount=total_revenue`: Renames `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` as requested in the output.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Calculates the rank for each merchant based on their `total_revenue`. The `RANKING` function is used here:
        *   `by=total_revenue.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_revenue` field in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).

This code calculates the total revenue from completed transactions received by each merchant and then ranks them accordingly, providing the merchant's name, category, total revenue amount, and their rank (MRR).

*Note: The query assumes that `status == 'Completed'` correctly identifies successfully received transactions. It also interprets the requirement based on the definition of MRR (ranking based on received amounts) and the schema, disregarding the potentially contradictory filter `receiver_type=1` mentioned in the prompt, as merchants are `receiver_type=2` according to the schema.*","# CALCULATE total revenue for each merchant from completed transactions they received

Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",ewallet,"Okay, let's break down the request and build the PyDough query step by step.

**1. Understanding the Goal:**

*   We need to calculate the ""Per Month Daily Active Users"" (PMDAU).
*   The definition provided is: PMDAU = Average of (Distinct senders per day) for each month.
*   The definition specifies `sender_type = 0`, but based on the schema description (`sender_type`: 1 for User, 2 for Merchant), it's highly likely this should be `sender_type = 1` to count *users*. We'll proceed assuming `sender_type = 1` means users.
*   The timeframe is the last two full calendar months, excluding the current month.

**2. Planning the Query:**

*   **Step 1: Define Time Boundaries:** Calculate the start date of the month two months ago and the start date of the current month.
*   **Step 2: Filter Transactions:** Select transactions within the calculated time range and where `sender_type` is 1 (User).
*   **Step 3: Extract Date Components:** Get the Year, Month, and Day for each relevant transaction.
*   **Step 4: Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU):** Group by Year, Month, and Day, and count the distinct `sender_id` for each day.
*   **Step 5: Calculate Monthly Average (PMDAU):** Group the daily results by Year and Month, and calculate the average of the daily distinct user counts.
*   **Step 6: Format Output:** Present the results as 'YYYY-MM' and the calculated PMDAU, ordered by month.

**3. Writing the PyDough Code:**

```python
# Step 1: Define Time Boundaries
date_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    start_current_month=DATETIME('now', 'start of month'),
    start_two_months_ago=DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')
)

# Step 2 & 3: Filter Transactions and Extract Date Components
relevant_transactions = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(
    (created_at >= start_two_months_ago) &
    (created_at < start_current_month) &
    (sender_type == 1) # Assuming sender_type 1 represents Users
).CALCULATE(
    tx_year=YEAR(created_at),
    tx_month=MONTH(created_at),
    tx_day=DAY(created_at),
    user_sender_id=sender_id # Keep the sender_id for distinct counting
)

# Step 4: Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)

    pmdau=AVG(daily_groups.dau_count) # Average the daily counts for the month
).ORDER_BY(month_str.ASC())

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = pmdau_results
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using `Ewallet.CALCULATE` (since `Ewallet` is the top-level collection) and the `DATETIME` function. `start_two_months_ago` marks the beginning of the period, and `start_current_month` marks the end (exclusive).
2.  **`relevant_transactions`**: We access the `Transactions` collection from the `date_boundaries` context. We filter transactions to be within the calculated date range (`>= start_two_months_ago` and `< start_current_month`) and ensure the sender is a user (`sender_type == 1`). We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the year, month, and day from `created_at` and keep the `sender_id` (renamed to `user_sender_id` for clarity).
3.  **`daily_active_users`**: We partition the `relevant_transactions` by year, month, and day using `PARTITION(name=""daily_groups"", by=(tx_year, tx_month, tx_day))`. Within each daily group, we calculate `dau_count` using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.user_sender_id)` to count the unique users who made a transaction on that specific day.
4.  **`pmdau_results`**: We take the `daily_active_users` results and partition them again, this time by year and month using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(tx_year, tx_month))`. For each month, we calculate:
    *   `month_str`: A formatted string 'YYYY-MM' using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
    *   `pmdau`: The average of the daily active user counts (`dau_count`) within that month, calculated using `AVG(daily_groups.dau_count)`.
5.  **`ORDER_BY`**: The final results are ordered chronologically by the `month_str`.
6.  **`result = pmdau_results`**: The final calculated collection is assigned to the variable `result`.","# Step 1: Define Time Boundaries

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection because we want a result for each user. `CALCULATE` is used to compute new values for each user record.
2.  **`user_identifier=uid`**: Selects the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and renames it to `user_identifier` in the output.
3.  **`total_duration_seconds=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(...), 0)`**: This calculates the total session duration for the user.
    *   **`SUM(...)`**: Aggregates the duration of relevant sessions.
    *   **`sessions.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `sessions` sub-collection for the current user and filters them based on the following criteria:
        *   `session_start_ts >= ""2023-06-01""`: Includes sessions starting on or after June 1st, 2023.
        *   `session_start_ts < ""2023-06-08""`: Includes sessions starting strictly *before* June 8th, 2023.
        *   `(HAS(session_start_ts)==1) & (HAS(session_end_ts)==1)`: Ensures that both start and end timestamps are present for a valid duration calculation.
    *   **`.CALCULATE(session_secs=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`**: For each filtered session, calculates the duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF` between the end and start timestamps. The result is temporarily named `session_secs`.
    *   **`.session_secs`**: Accesses the calculated `session_secs` value for the `SUM` function.
    *   **`DEFAULT_TO(..., 0)`**: If a user has no sessions within the specified date range (or no sessions with both start/end times), the `SUM` might result in `NULL`. `DEFAULT_TO` ensures that the `total_duration_seconds` will be 0 in such cases, providing an integer result as requested.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(total_duration_seconds.DESC())`**: Sorts the final results based on the calculated `total_duration_seconds` in descending order, placing users with the longest total session duration first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_1_coupons = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons`**: This line first filters the `Merchants` collection to find the specific merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is equal to 1. Then, it accesses the `coupons` sub-collection associated with that merchant. The result `merchant_1_coupons` is a collection containing all coupons issued by merchant 1.
2.  **`coupon_transaction_totals = merchant_1_coupons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line operates on the collection of coupons belonging to merchant 1.
3.  **`coupon_id=cid`**: Inside the `CALCULATE` function, this selects the coupon's identifier (`cid`) and renames it to `coupon_id` in the output.
4.  **`total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`**: This calculates the total transaction amount for each coupon. It accesses the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which contains all transactions where the current coupon was used) and applies the `SUM` aggregation function to their `amount` field. The result is named `total_amount`.

"What is the TUC in the past month, inclusive of 1 month ago? Return the total count.TUC = Total number of user sessions in the past month","SELECT COUNT(*) AS TUC FROM user_sessions WHERE session_start_ts >= DATE('now', '-1 month') OR session_end_ts >= DATE('now', '-1 month');",ewallet,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Calculate the ""Total number of user sessions (TUC)"" within the last month, including today and exactly one month ago.
2.  **Definition:** TUC is explicitly defined as the total count of records in the `UserSessions` collection within the specified timeframe.
3.  **Collection:** We need to access the `UserSessions` collection.
4.  **Filtering:** We need to filter sessions based on their start time (`session_start_ts`). The condition is that the session start time must be between exactly one month ago and the current time (now).
5.  **Time Calculation:** We can use `DATETIME('now')` for the current time and `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` for the time exactly one month ago.
6.  **Aggregation:** We need the total count of the filtered sessions. This can be achieved using the `COUNT` aggregation function. Since we want a single total number, we'll apply this count at the top `Ewallet` graph level.

**PyDough Code Generation:**

```python
# Filter UserSessions to include only those started within the last month (inclusive)
sessions_last_month = UserSessions.WHERE(
    (session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))
)

# Calculate the total count of these sessions
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    tuc_past_month = COUNT(sessions_last_month)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_last_month = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection and filters it.
    *   `session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This condition selects sessions that started on or after the timestamp exactly one month prior to the current time.
    *   `session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now')`: This condition selects sessions that started on or before the current time.
    *   `&`: The logical AND operator ensures both conditions must be true for a session to be included.
2.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(tuc_past_month = COUNT(sessions_last_month))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We perform the calculation at the top-level `Ewallet` graph to get a single aggregated value.
    *   `tuc_past_month = COUNT(sessions_last_month)`: This calculates the total number of records in the previously filtered `sessions_last_month` collection and assigns it to the field `tuc_past_month`.","# Filter UserSessions to include only those started within the last MONTH (inclusive)

result = str_calculation.CALCULATE(previous_month_str=previous_month_str)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: This calculates the necessary date boundaries:
    *   `start_of_current_month`: Finds the first moment of the current calendar month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_of_previous_month`: Finds the first moment of the previous calendar month by taking the start of the current month and subtracting one month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`.
2.  **`prev_month_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to the start of the previous month AND less than the start of the current month).
3.  **`transaction_counts`**: This takes the filtered transactions and adds a boolean field `is_successful`, which is `True` if the transaction `status` is 'Completed' and `False` otherwise.
4.  **`str_calculation`**: This performs the core aggregation at the `Ewallet` graph level:
    *   `total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions within the `transaction_counts` collection (which represents the filtered previous month's transactions).
    *   `successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts only the transactions within `transaction_counts` where the `is_successful` flag is `True`.
    *   `previous_month_str`: Calculates the Success Transaction Rate (STR) by dividing the successful count by the total count and multiplying by 100.0 for percentage. It uses `IFF` to check if `total_tx_prev_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` if there were no transactions in the previous month.
5.  **`result`**: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the `previous_month_str` field, ensuring only the requested STR value is returned.","# CALCULATE the start of the current MONTH and the start of the previous MONTH

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_info = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, it calculates their creation month using `MONTH(created_at)` and stores it as `merchant_creation_month`. It also selects the merchant's ID (`mid` as `merchant_id`) and name (`name` as `merchant_name`).
2.  **`merchant_coupon_counts = merchant_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step builds upon the previous one. For each merchant in `merchant_info`:
    *   It accesses the `coupons` sub-collection associated with that merchant.
    *   It filters these coupons using `WHERE(MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month)`. This condition checks if the creation month of the coupon (`MONTH(created_at)`) is the same as the pre-calculated creation month of the merchant (`merchant_creation_month`).
    *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition for the current merchant. This count is stored as `num_coupons_same_month`.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are carried over.
3.  **`result = merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_same_month.DESC())`**: Finally, this step takes the collection of merchants (each with their respective `num_coupons_same_month` count) and selects the top 1 merchant based on this count in descending order (`DESC()`). This effectively finds the merchant who created the highest number of coupons in their own creation month. The final `result` variable contains the `merchant_id`, `merchant_name`, and `num_coupons_same_month` for this top merchant.","# Step 1: CALCULATE the creation MONTH for each merchant and select necessary fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters for users whose `country` field, when converted to lowercase, is exactly 'us'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the country.
3.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This condition checks if the user has *at least one* notification that meets the nested criteria:
    *   **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for the current user.
    *   **`(notification_type == 'Promotion')`**: Filters notifications to include only those with the exact type 'Promotion'.
    *   **`(status == 'Sent')`**: Further filters these promotional notifications to include only those with the exact status 'Sent' (assuming 'Sent' implies unread, as opposed to a 'Read' status).
4.  **`&`**: This combines the country filter and the notification existence filter, ensuring both conditions are met for a user to be included.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, we calculate the required output fields for each matching user.
6.  **`username=username`**: Selects the `username` field.
7.  **`total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(...)`**: Calculates the total count of unread promotional notifications for the user.
    *   **`COUNT(notifications.WHERE(...))`**: Counts the number of notifications within the user's `notifications` sub-collection that satisfy the same conditions used in the `HAS` check (`notification_type == 'Promotion'` and `status == 'Sent'`).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step filters the `Transactions` collection based on several criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Selects only transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == 1`: Ensures that the sender was a user (type 1) and not a merchant (type 2).
    *   `status == 'Completed'`: Includes only transactions that were successfully completed.
    *   `sending_user.status == 'Active'`: Filters for transactions where the associated sending user has an 'Active' status.

2.  **`transaction_info`**: This step calculates two new fields from the filtered transactions:
    *   `year_month_str`: Creates a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., '2023-01'). `LPAD` ensures the month number is always two digits (e.g., '01' instead of '1').
    *   `sending_user_id`: Extracts the `sender_id` (which corresponds to the user's `uid` because we filtered `sender_type == 1`). This is needed for counting distinct users later.

3.  **`monthly_user_groups`**: This step partitions the `transaction_info` data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_transactions"", by=(year_month_str))`: Groups the transactions based on the unique `year_month_str` values. Each group represents a specific month in 2023.

4.  **`distinct_active_users_per_month`**: This step performs calculations on each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `month_date = year_month_str`: Selects the year-month string, renaming it to `month_date` for clarity in the final output.
    *   `num_distinct_active_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_id` values within each month's partition. Since we already filtered for active users who sent completed transactions, this gives the count of distinct active users who sent money in that specific month. We refer back to `Transactions.sender_id` here to count the distinct IDs within the context of the filtered transactions belonging to that partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically based on the `month_date` string.

5.  **`result = distinct_active_users_per_month`**: Assigns the final computed collection to the `result` variable.","# Filter transactions to include only those sent by active users in 2023 and were completed successfully.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection, which contains information about all merchants.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(coupons) == 1)`**: We filter this collection. The `HASNOT(coupons)` function checks if the `coupons` sub-collection (which lists coupons issued by the merchant) is empty. `== 1` confirms the condition is true (the merchant has no coupons).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid, merchant_name=name)`**: For the merchants who satisfy the `WHERE` condition (i.e., have no coupons), we select their `mid` (renamed to `merchant_id`) and `name` (renamed to `merchant_name`).","merchants_without_coupons = Merchants.WHERE(HASNOT(coupons) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Analysis:**

1.  **Goal:** Get a unique list of merchant IDs (`mid`) that have appeared as the *receiver* in any transaction.
2.  **Relevant Collections:** `Merchants` and `Transactions`.
3.  **Key Fields/Relationships:**
    *   `Merchants.mid`: The ID we want to return.
    *   `Merchants.transactions_received`: This is a list of transactions where the merchant was the receiver. This relationship directly links merchants to the transactions they received.
4.  **Logic:** We need to find all merchants for whom the `transactions_received` list is not empty. Then, we just need to extract their `mid`.
5.  **PyDough Functions:**
    *   `WHERE`: To filter the merchants.
    *   `HAS`: To check if the `transactions_received` list has at least one transaction.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To select only the `mid`.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Find merchants who have received at least one transaction
receiving_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1)

# Select only the distinct merchant IDs (mid) from those merchants
distinct_merchant_ids = receiving_merchants.CALCULATE(
    merchant_id=mid
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `receiving_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters it. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HAS(transactions_received) == 1` condition, which checks if the `transactions_received` sub-collection (linking a merchant to transactions where they were the receiver) contains at least one record. This effectively selects all merchants who have received money in at least one transaction.
2.  `distinct_merchant_ids = receiving_merchants.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`: This line takes the filtered `receiving_merchants` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to select only the `mid` field for each merchant, renaming it to `merchant_id` in the output. Since we started with the `Merchants` collection, each record already represents a unique merchant, ensuring the resulting list of `merchant_id`s is distinct.","# Find merchants who have received at least one transaction

# Select the distinct user IDs (uid) from the filtered users
result = users_with_transaction_notifications.CALCULATE(
    user_id=uid

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'Transaction')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `notifications`: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection linked to each user.
    *   `.WHERE(notification_type == 'Transaction')`: Filters these notifications to include only those where the `notification_type` field is exactly 'Transaction'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if, after filtering, there is at least one ('== 1') transaction notification remaining for the current user.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_id=uid)`**: After filtering to get only the users who have received transaction notifications, this step selects only their user ID (`uid`) and renames it to `user_id` in the final output. Since the filtering happens on the `Users` collection, the resulting `user_id` values will be distinct.","# Find users who have received at least one notification of type 'Transaction'

1.  **Analyze the Request:** We need to find users who have *no* associated records in their `notifications` sub-collection. The output should include the user's `uid` and `username`.

2.  **Identify Collections and Fields:**
    *   Start with the `Users` collection.
    *   Check the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
    *   Select the `uid` and `username` fields from the `Users` collection.

3.  **Determine the PyDough Operation:**
    *   We need to filter the `Users` collection.
    *   The filter condition involves checking if the `notifications` sub-collection is empty. The `HASNOT()` function is suitable for this.
    *   We need to select specific fields, so `CALCULATE` will be used.

4.  **Generate the Code:**

```python
# Find users who have not received any notifications
users_without_notifications = Users.WHERE(HASNOT(notifications) == 1).CALCULATE(
    user_id=uid,
    user_name=username
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users`: We start with the `Users` collection, which contains all user records.
2.  `.WHERE(HASNOT(notifications) == 1)`: This filters the `Users` collection.
    *   `HASNOT(notifications)` checks if the `notifications` sub-collection (linked to each user) is empty. It returns `True` (or 1) if the user has no notifications and `False` (or 0) otherwise.
    *   `== 1` ensures we only keep users for whom `HASNOT(notifications)` is true.
3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id=uid, user_name=username)`: For the users who passed the filter (i.e., have no notifications), this selects and renames the required fields:
    *   `user_id=uid`: Selects the `uid` field and names it `user_id` in the output.
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username` field and names it `user_name` in the output.
4.  `users_without_notifications = ...`: The final result, containing the `user_id` and `user_name` of users without notifications, is assigned to the variable `users_without_notifications`.","# Find users who have not received any notifications

**Explanation:**

1.  **`UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`**: This groups the `UserSessions` records based on the unique values found in the `device_type` field. Each group represents a distinct device type.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(device_type=device_type, session_count=COUNT(UserSessions))`**: Within each `device_type` group created by the partition, this calculates two fields:
    *   `device_type`: Retains the `device_type` value that defines the current group.
    *   `session_count`: Counts the total number of `UserSessions` records within that specific `device_type` group using the `COUNT` aggregation function.
3.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=session_count.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the previous step (a collection where each row represents a unique `device_type` and its `session_count`) and selects the top 2 rows based on the `session_count` field, ordered in descending order (highest count first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.PARTITION(name=""status_groups"", by=(status))`**: This groups all records in the `Transactions` collection based on the unique values found in the `status` field. Each group represents a distinct transaction status.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_status=status, status_count=COUNT(Transactions))`**: For each group created by the partition, this step calculates two fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Ewallet.Coupons`**: We start with the `Coupons` collection from the `Ewallet` database.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to compute new fields for each coupon based on its properties and related data.
    *   **`coupon_code=code`**: Selects the `code` field from the `Coupons` collection and renames it to `coupon_code`.
    *   **`total_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in)`**: Counts the number of records in the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection for each coupon. This sub-collection represents the transactions where the specific coupon was used, so the count gives the total number of times the coupon was redeemed.
    *   **`total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all transactions within the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection for each coupon. This gives the total monetary value redeemed using that coupon.
3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())`**: This function selects the top 3 records based on the `total_redemptions` field calculated in the previous step. The `.DESC()` specifies that the sorting should be in descending order (most frequent first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`todays_relevant_balances = MerchantBalances.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `MerchantBalances` collection.
    *   `DATETIME(updated_at, 'start of day') == DATETIME('now', 'start of day')`: This condition selects balance records where the `updated_at` date matches today's date. We use `DATETIME` with `'start of day'` to ensure we compare only the date part, ignoring the time.
    *   `merchant.status == 'Active'`: This filters for balances belonging to merchants whose status is 'Active'. We access the linked merchant's status using `merchant.status`.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail')`: This filters for balances belonging to merchants whose category contains the word 'retail'. `LOWER()` is used to make the search case-insensitive.
2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level.
    *   `median_retail_balance_today = MEDIAN(todays_relevant_balances.balance)`: This calculates the median value of the `balance` field from the previously filtered `todays_relevant_balances` collection and assigns it to the `median_retail_balance_today` field in the final result. The `MEDIAN` function aggregates the balances from all records in the filtered collection to compute the single median value requested.","# First, filter MerchantBalances to get only today's balances for active merchants whose category CONTAINS 'retail'.
# We normalize both the balance update date and the current date to the start of the DAY for accurate comparison.

What was the average transaction daily and monthly limit for the earliest setting snapshot in 2023?,"SELECT AVG(tx_limit_daily) AS avg_daily_limit, AVG(tx_limit_monthly) AS avg_monthly_limit FROM user_setting_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date = (SELECT MIN(snapshot_date) FROM user_setting_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date >= '2023-01-01' AND snapshot_date < '2024-01-01');",ewallet,"Okay, let's break down the request and generate the PyDough code.

**1. Analyze the Request:**

*   We need data from the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection.
*   We need to filter these snapshots to only include those from the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`).
*   From the 2023 snapshots, we need to identify the ones taken on the *earliest* date.
*   For those specific earliest snapshots (there might be multiple on the same earliest date), we need to calculate the *average* `tx_limit_daily` and the *average* `tx_limit_monthly`.

**2. Strategy:**

*   Filter `UserSettingSnapshots` for the year 2023.
*   Use the `RANKING` window function to identify the snapshots with the earliest `snapshot_date` within 2023. We'll rank by `snapshot_date` ascending and allow ties, selecting rank 1.
*   Calculate the average `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` across the resulting set of earliest snapshots. Since we want a single row result with the averages, we'll perform the final aggregation using `CALCULATE` on the top-level `Ewallet` graph.

**3. Generate PyDough Code:**

```python
# Filter snapshots for 2023 and identify the earliest ones using RANKING
earliest_snapshots_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(
    (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) &
    (RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1)
)

# Calculate the average daily and monthly limits across these earliest snapshots
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    avg_daily_limit = AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_daily),
    avg_monthly_limit = AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_monthly)
)
```

**4. Explanation:**

1.  **`earliest_snapshots_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these snapshots based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`: This ensures only snapshots from the year 2023 are considered.
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1`: This applies a ranking within the 2023 snapshots. It ranks them based on `snapshot_date` in ascending order (`ASC()`), meaning the earliest dates get the lowest ranks. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest date, they all receive rank 1. The condition `== 1` filters the results to include only these earliest snapshots.
2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs the final calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single result row.
    *   `avg_daily_limit = AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_daily)`: This calculates the average value of the `tx_limit_daily` field across all the snapshots identified in the `earliest_snapshots_2023` collection.
    *   `avg_monthly_limit = AVG(earliest_snapshots_2023.tx_limit_monthly)`: Similarly, this calculates the average value of the `tx_limit_monthly` field across the same set of earliest snapshots.

The final `result` variable will contain a single record with the average daily and monthly transaction limits from the earliest snapshot(s) taken in 2023.","# Filter snapshots for 2023 and identify the earliest ones using RANKING
earliest_snapshots_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection. It uses `CALCULATE` to create a temporary collection containing:
    *   `device_type`: The type of device used for the session.
    *   `session_duration_seconds`: A new field calculated by finding the difference in seconds between the `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` using the `DATEDIFF` function.

2.  **`average_session_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This line takes the `session_durations` collection and partitions (groups) it.
    *   `name=""sessions_by_device""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups (though not strictly needed for the final calculation here).
    *   `by=(device_type)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values found in the `device_type` field.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This `CALCULATE` operates on each partition group created in the previous step.
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` (which is the key for the current partition group).
    *   `avg_duration_seconds=AVG(session_durations.session_duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `session_duration_seconds` field (which was calculated in the first step) for all sessions belonging to the current `device_type` partition group.

4.  **`result = average_session_duration_by_device`**: Assigns the final computed collection, containing each `device_type` and its corresponding average session duration in seconds, to the `result` variable.","# CALCULATE the duration of each session in seconds first

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Users` collection and applying a filter using `WHERE`.
2.  **`HASNOT(...) == 1`**: This function checks if a sub-collection (or a filtered version of it) is empty. We are looking for users where the *result* of the inner `notifications.WHERE(...)` is empty, meaning they have *no* notifications matching that inner condition.
3.  **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: Inside `HASNOT`, we access the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and filter these notifications.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) < 365`**: This is the core condition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date1, date2)` calculates the number of full days between `date1` and `date2`.
    *   `Users.created_at` refers to the signup date of the parent `User` record.
    *   `created_at` refers to the creation date of the current `notification` record being evaluated.
    *   The condition `< 365` filters for notifications that were created less than 365 days *after* the user signed up (i.e., within the first year).
5.  **`CALCULATE(user_name=username, user_email=email, signup_date=created_at)`**: After filtering the users, we use `CALCULATE` to select only the required fields: `username`, `email`, and the user's `created_at` date, renaming them for clarity in the output.
6.  **`result = ...`**: The final query is assigned to the `result` variable.
