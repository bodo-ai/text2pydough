**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, we calculate:
    *   `cust_name`: The customer's name.
    *   `total_transactions`: The total number of transactions associated with the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `successful_transactions`: The number of transactions with a `status` of 'Completed'. We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection first using `WHERE(status == 'Completed')` and then count the results. *Note: This assumes 'Completed' signifies a successful transaction based on typical usage; adjust if the success status is different.*
2.  **`filtered_customers = customer_transaction_counts.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the results from the previous step to include only customers where `total_transactions >= 5`.
3.  **`customer_success_rates = filtered_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, we calculate:
    *   `customer_name`: We select the customer's name (carried over as `cust_name`).
    *   `success_rate`: We calculate the success rate by dividing `successful_transactions` by `total_transactions` and multiplying by `100.0` to get a percentage and ensure floating-point division.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the results in ascending order based on the calculated `success_rate`.",23.63135361671448,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This makes the query easier to read and maintain.
2.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
3.  **`num_distinct_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of customers that satisfy the conditions defined within the `Customers.WHERE(...)` clause. The result is assigned to the field `num_distinct_customers`.
4.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This selects the `Customers` collection and applies filtering conditions.
5.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`**: This is the first condition. It filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
6.  **`&`**: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two filtering conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
7.  **`(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(...)) == 1)`**: This is the second condition. It checks if a customer has at least one (`== 1`) related transaction (`transactions_made`) that meets the inner `WHERE` condition.
8.  **`transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`**: This filters the customer's transactions (`transactions_made`). It accesses the `ticker` related to each transaction and checks if its `symbol` is present (`ISIN`) in the `faang_symbols` tuple defined earlier.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:** We first establish the date range of interest using `DATETIME`. `current_week_start_date` marks the beginning of the current week, and `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` marks the beginning of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week's start.
2.  **Filter Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `ticker.ticker_type == 'Stock'`: Ensures we only consider stock transactions by checking the related `ticker`'s type.
    *   `(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week') >= eight_weeks_ago_start_date)`: Includes transactions from the start of the 8th week ago onwards.
    *   `(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week') < current_week_start_date)`: Excludes transactions from the current week.
3.  **Calculate Week Info:** Within the filtered set, `CALCULATE` derives two new fields:
    *   `week_start`: Calculates the starting date of the week for each transaction's `date_time` using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend_transaction`: Uses `DAYNAME` to get the day of the week for the `date_time` and `ISIN` to check if it's ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", resulting in a boolean (True/False).
4.  **Partition by Week:** The `PARTITION` function groups the `relevant_transactions` into weekly buckets based on the calculated `week_start` date. Each group is accessible via the name `weekly_group`.
5.  **Aggregate Weekly Counts:** We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data (`weekly_transaction_groups`):
    *   `week_starting_date = week_start`: Selects the partition key (the week's start date).
    *   `total_stock_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific `weekly_group`.
    *   `weekend_stock_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the boolean `is_weekend_transaction` flag for all transactions within the group. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in sums, this effectively counts the weekend transactions.
6.  **Order Results:** Finally, `ORDER_BY(week_starting_date.ASC())` sorts the weekly summaries chronologically based on their starting date.
7.  **Assign to Variable:** The final result set is assigned to the `result` variable.",34.23880386352539,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week window before it

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info`**: Calculates the necessary date boundaries. `start_of_current_month` is the first moment of the current month. `start_of_period` is calculated by going back 6 months from `start_of_current_month`.
2.  **`customers_in_period`**: Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the desired period (greater than or equal to `start_of_period` and less than `start_of_current_month`). It also extracts the `signup_year` and `signup_month` from the `join_date` for partitioning.
3.  **`monthly_customer_groups`**: Partitions the filtered customers into groups based on the year and month they signed up (`signup_year`, `signup_month`). Each partition (`signup_months`) represents a specific signup month within the 6-month window.
4.  **`customer_metrics_by_month`**: Calculates the required metrics for each monthly group:
    *   `signup_year` and `signup_month`: Identifies the specific month for the metrics.
    *   `pmcs`: Counts the number of customers within the current partition group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   `pmat`: Calculates the average `amount` of all transactions (`transactions_made`) associated with the customers in the current partition group using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, the average is reported as 0.0 instead of null.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(...)`**: Sorts the final results chronologically by signup year and then by signup month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_prices_info = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection. It then filters these records using `WHERE` to include only those where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full days between the price record's `date` and the current time.
    *   The condition `(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 6)` ensures we select records from today (difference = 0) up to 6 days ago (difference = 6), covering a total of 7 days.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(close_price=close, ticker_type=ticker.ticker_type)`**: After filtering, this calculates two fields for the relevant price records:
    *   `close_price`: Renames the `close` field.
    *   `ticker_type`: Accesses the `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record for each daily price.
3.  **`partitioned_by_type = recent_prices_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered and calculated `recent_prices_info` collection.
    *   `name=""type_group""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(ticker_type)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values of the `ticker_type` field calculated in the previous step.
4.  **`ticker_type_acp = partitioned_by_type.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs calculations on each partition group created.
    *   `ticker_type=ticker_type`: Selects the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP=AVG(recent_prices_info.close_price)`: Calculates the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each group. It takes the average of the `close_price` field from the `recent_prices_info` collection *within the context of the current partition group* (i.e., for all records belonging to that specific `ticker_type` within the 7-day window).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_joined_2022_with_transactions`**:
    *   Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Filters customers using `WHERE`:
        *   `YEAR(join_date) == 2022`: Selects only customers who joined in the year 2022.
        *   `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`: Selects only customers who have at least one transaction.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to select the `country` and create a new field `is_active`. `is_active` is set to 1 if the customer's `status` is 'Active', and 0 otherwise. This boolean conversion helps in the aggregation step.

2.  **`activity_ratio_by_country`**:
    *   Takes the filtered `customers_joined_2022_with_transactions`.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group these customers by their `country`. Each group is named `country_groups`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Selects the `country` (which is the partition key).
        *   Calculates the Activity Ratio (`AR`):
            *   `SUM(Customers.is_active)`: Sums the `is_active` flag (1 for active, 0 for inactive) for all customers *within the current country group*. This gives the count of active customers with transactions in that country.
            *   `COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the total number of customers *within the current country group*. This gives the total number of customers with transactions in that country.
            *   The ratio `SUM(Customers.is_active) / COUNT(Customers)` is calculated, and multiplied by `100.0` (using a float ensures floating-point division) to get the percentage AR.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we need a single aggregated result (the count).
2.  **`num_matching_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_matching_customers` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` aggregation function.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: Inside `COUNT`, we specify the collection to count (`Customers`) and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: We convert both the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase using `LOWER()` to ensure case-insensitive matching.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This line starts with the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `transaction_type == ""sell""`: Selects only sales transactions.
    *   `date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: Selects transactions that occurred from exactly one month ago up to the current time. `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` calculates the timestamp for one month prior to the execution time.
2.  **`transactions_with_symbol`**: This calculates a new field `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` field from the related `ticker` record for each transaction. The original fields (`amount`, `tax`, `commission`, etc.) remain accessible from the `filtered_transactions` context.
3.  **`ticker_groups`**: This partitions the `transactions_with_symbol` collection into groups based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol`. Each group (named `ticker_group`) contains all the filtered sell transactions for a specific ticker symbol from the last month.
4.  **`ticker_aggregates`**: This step operates on each `ticker_group` created by the partition. It calculates:
    *   `ticker_symbol`: Retrieves the ticker symbol for the group (which is the partition key).
    *   `total_amount`: Sums the `amount` of all `Transactions` within the current group.
    *   `total_tax`: Sums the `tax` of all `Transactions` within the current group.
    *   `total_commission`: Sums the `commission` of all `Transactions` within the current group.
5.  **`ticker_spm_results`**: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) for each ticker symbol using the aggregates calculated previously:
    *   It selects the `ticker_symbol`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info`**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each daily price record, we retrieve the associated ticker's symbol (`ticker.symbol`), create a standardized month string in 'YYYY-MM' format (`month_str`) using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure months like January are '01'), and keep the `high`, `low`, and `close` prices.
2.  **`ticker_months_partition`**: This partitions the `price_info` data based on the combination of `symbol` and `month_str`. This effectively groups all daily records for a specific ticker within a specific month.
3.  **`monthly_aggregates`**: For each group created in the previous step (each ticker-month), we calculate the required aggregate values: the average closing price (`AVG(DailyPrices.close)`), the maximum high price (`MAX(DailyPrices.high)`), and the minimum low price (`MIN(DailyPrices.low)`). We also carry forward the `symbol` and `month_str` from the partition keys.
4.  **`symbol_partition`**: We take the results of the monthly aggregation (`monthly_aggregates`) and partition this data again, this time only by `symbol`. This creates groups containing all the monthly aggregate rows for each individual ticker. This step is crucial for correctly applying the `PREV` window function on a per-ticker basis.
5.  **`stats_with_prev_close`**: Within each `symbol_group` partition, we access the `monthly_aggregates` data. We use the `PREV` window function to get the `avg_close` from the preceding month for the *same ticker*.
    *   `PREV(avg_close, ...)` targets the average closing price.
    *   `by=month_str.ASC()` ensures that ""preceding"" means the month immediately before, chronologically.
    *   `per=""symbol_group""` restricts the `PREV` calculation to operate only within the current ticker's data (i.e., it doesn't look at the previous month of a *different* ticker).
    *   `default=None` handles the case for the earliest month available for each ticker, where there is no preceding month; `prev_avg_close` will be `None` for these rows.
6.  **`result`**: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the Month-over-Month Change (`MoMC`) using the formula `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
    *   The `IFF` function ensures we only perform the calculation if `prev_avg_close` is not `None` (i.e., not the first month) and not zero (to prevent division by zero errors), otherwise `MoMC` is set to `None`.
    *   We select the final desired columns: `symbol`, `month` (renaming `month_str`), `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, and the calculated `MoMC`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())` sorts the final output first by ticker symbol alphabetically and then by month chronologically for easier analysis.",62.03374981880188,"# Step 1: Prepare daily price data with symbol and formatted month string (YYYY-MM)

1.  **`filtered_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records where the `date` falls between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023, inclusive.
2.  **`ticker_price_range = filtered_prices.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_prices` by the stock's `symbol` (accessed via the `ticker` relationship). This groups all relevant daily price records for each unique stock symbol.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (after PARTITION)**: For each `ticker_group` created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `ticker_symbol`: The symbol of the stock for that group.
    *   `min_low_in_range`: The minimum `low` price found within that group's daily records (i.e., the lowest price for that stock in the date range).
    *   `max_high_in_range`: The maximum `high` price found within that group's daily records (i.e., the highest price for that stock in the date range).
4.  **`ticker_price_change = ticker_price_range.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the results from the previous step and calculates the `price_change` for each stock by subtracting the `min_low_in_range` from the `max_high_in_range`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_in_range = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only the records where the `date_time` falls between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, inclusive. We use `>= ""2023-01-01""` for the start date and `< ""2023-04-01""` for the end date to ensure all timestamps on March 31st are included.
2.  **`transaction_type_analysis = transactions_in_range.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on the unique values in the `transaction_type` field.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each partition (i.e., for each transaction type), this calculates:
    *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`: Selects the transaction type itself (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: Counts the number of unique `customer_id`s associated with the transactions in that specific type group.
    *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: Calculates the average value of the `shares` field for all transactions within that type group.
4.  **`top_3_types_by_customers = transaction_type_analysis.TOP_K(...)`**: This takes the results from the previous step (one row per transaction type with its stats) and selects the top 3 rows based on the `num_distinct_customers` field, sorted in descending order.
5.  **`result = top_3_types_by_customers`**: Assigns the final result (the top 3 transaction types and their calculated metrics) to the `result` variable.",25.78154945373535,"# Filter transactions to include only those within the specified date range (Jan 1, 2023 to Mar 31, 2023 inclusive)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Transactions` collection and calculates two new fields for each transaction: `cust_state` (derived from the related customer's state) and `tick_type` (derived from the related ticker's type).
2.  **`grouped_transactions = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection into groups based on unique combinations of the calculated `cust_state` and `tick_type`. Each group represents a specific state-ticker\_type pair.
3.  **`combination_counts = grouped_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each group (combination), it calculates:
    *   `customer_state`: Selects the state for the group (which is one of the partition keys).
    *   `ticker_type`: Selects the ticker type for the group (the other partition key).
    *   `num_transactions`: Counts the number of original `Transactions` that fall into this specific state-ticker\_type group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
4.  **`top_combinations = combination_counts.TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the previous step and selects the top 5 rows, ordered by the `num_transactions` field in descending order (highest count first).

2.  **`lowest_vti_close_last_7_days=MIN(...)`**: We define a new field `lowest_vti_close_last_7_days` and assign the minimum value found by the `MIN` function to it.
3.  **`DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `DailyPrices` collection and filter it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND).
4.  **`(ticker.symbol == ""VTI"")`**: This condition filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is exactly ""VTI"". We access the related `ticker` and its `symbol` field.
5.  **`(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)`**: This condition filters for records within the last 7 days.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` field of the `DailyPrices` record and the current date.
    *   `<= 7` ensures we only include records where this difference is 7 days or less (i.e., within the past 7 days, inclusive of today).
6.  **`.close`**: After filtering, we select the `close` price field from the remaining `DailyPrices` records.
7.  **`MIN(...)`**: The `MIN` function then finds the minimum value among these selected `close` prices.",13.039551734924316,"import datetime

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes a new field `transaction_count` for each customer.
2.  **`COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(...))`**: Inside the `CALCULATE`, we count the transactions associated with each customer (`transactions_made`). We filter these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those that meet two conditions:
    *   `transaction_type == 'sell'`: The transaction must be a 'sell'.
    *   `(YEAR(date_time) == 2023) & (MONTH(date_time) == 4) & (DAY(date_time) == 1)`: The date part of the `date_time` field must exactly match 2023-04-01.
3.  **`customer_id = _id, customer_name = name`**: We also carry forward the customer's `_id` and `name` within this `CALCULATE` step, renaming them slightly to avoid potential conflicts and for clarity.
4.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())`**: After calculating the count for all customers, `TOP_K(1, ...)` selects the single customer (`k=1`) who has the highest `transaction_count`. `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(_id = customer_id, name = customer_name, num_transactions = transaction_count)`**: The final `CALCULATE` selects only the fields requested in the output: the customer's original `_id`, their `name`, and the calculated `num_transactions` (renamed from `transaction_count` for clarity in the final output).",29.000272512435917,"# Start with the Customers collection

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_q1_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those records that meet three conditions:
    *   `status == 'Success'`: The transaction status must be 'Success'.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: The transaction must have occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: The month of the transaction must be January (1), February (2), or March (3), corresponding to the first quarter.
2.  **`transactions_info = transactions_q1_2023.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates two new fields from the filtered transactions:
    *   `trans_year`: Extracts the year from the `date_time`.
    *   `trans_month`: Extracts the month (1-12) from the `date_time`. These fields are needed for grouping.
3.  **`monthly_groups = transactions_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the `transactions_info` data based on the unique combinations of `trans_year` and `trans_month`. Each partition (`monthly_data`) represents a specific month within Q1 2023.
4.  **`monthly_avg_price = monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs calculations for each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `month_str=JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", trans_year, LPAD(trans_month, 2, ""0""))`: Creates a formatted string for the month (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02""). `LPAD` ensures the month part always has two digits.
    *   `avg_transaction_price=AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average `price` for all the original `Transactions` belonging to the current month's group.
5.  **`result = monthly_avg_price.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and renames the final columns for the output:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_range_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the boundaries for our date range at the top level (`Dealership`).
    *   `end_date`: Calculated as the start of the current week minus one day, effectively giving the end of the last complete calendar week.
    *   `start_date`: Calculated as the start of the current week minus 8 weeks, giving the beginning of the 8-week period we are interested in.
2.  **`payments_info = date_range_info.Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with `Sales`, filter for those with `sale_price > 30000`.
3.  **`.payment.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `payment` sub-collection for these sales and filter them to include only payments where the `payment_date` falls within our calculated `start_date` and `end_date`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each relevant payment, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date`: The date of the start of the week in which the payment occurred using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend`: A boolean flag indicating if the payment day name (obtained via `DAYNAME(payment_date)`) is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using `ISIN`.
5.  **`weekly_payment_counts = payments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `payments_info` collection using the calculated `week_start_date` as the key. This groups all payments from the same week together.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each week's partition (`weeks`):
    *   We select the `week_start_date` (renamed to `week_date`).
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: We count all payment records within the current week's partition.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.is_weekend)`: We sum the `is_weekend` flag for all payments within the partition. Since boolean True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in sums, this effectively counts the weekend payments.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`**: This selects cars from the `Cars` collection. It filters them based on the `vin_number`. `LOWER(vin_number)` converts the VIN to lowercase, and `LIKE(..., '%m5%')` checks if this lowercase VIN contains the substring 'm5', effectively performing a case-insensitive partial match.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`**: This takes the filtered cars and groups them based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model`. Each group is conceptually named ""model\_group"".
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group (which is one of the partition keys).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group (the other partition key).
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: This calculates the total number of sales for the current group. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection of the `Cars` *within* the current partition (`model_group`) and counts how many sales records exist across all cars belonging to that specific make and model group.",19.49613904953003,"# Filter cars whose VIN contains 'M5' (case-insensitive) and group them by make and model.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales = Dealership.Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing all `Sales` records from the main `Dealership` collection. It then filters these sales based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   **`car.make == 'Toyota'`**: It checks if the `make` of the associated `car` for the sale is 'Toyota'.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`**: It calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition `<= 29` ensures that only sales from today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago (inclusive, making it a 30-day period) are included.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final aggregated results based on the filtered `recent_toyota_sales`.
    *   **`number_of_sales=COUNT(recent_toyota_sales)`**: It counts the total number of records in the `recent_toyota_sales` collection, giving the total count of Toyota sales in the specified period.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_aggregates = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection. It uses `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select the `first_name` and `last_name`, renaming them to `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name` to avoid potential conflicts.
    *   Calculate the `total_sales_amount` for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their related `sales_made` records.
    *   Calculate the `num_sales` for each salesperson by counting their related `sales_made` records.
2.  **`salesperson_ranked = salesperson_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the results from the previous step (`salesperson_aggregates`) and performs another `CALCULATE`:
    *   It carries over the `sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, and `num_sales` fields, renaming the first two back to `first_name` and `last_name` and `num_sales` to `number_of_sales` as requested in the output.
    *   It calculates the sales rank (`SR`) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `by` the `total_sales_amount` in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning the salesperson with the highest total sales gets rank 1.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars`**: We start with the `Cars` collection. We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter cars based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This ensures that the car has been sold at least once by checking if the `sale_records` sub-collection is not empty.
    *   The second condition checks the latest inventory status. It accesses the `inventory_snapshots` for each car, uses `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1` to identify the most recent snapshot for that specific car, selects that single record using `.SINGULAR()`, and then checks if its `is_in_inventory` field is `False`.
2.  **`partitioned_cars`**: The `filtered_cars` collection (containing only sold cars not currently in inventory) is then partitioned using `PARTITION`. We group the cars by their `make` and `model`, naming the partition groups `make_model_group`.
3.  **`make_model_max_prices`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each group (unique make/model combination):
    *   We select the `make` and `model` (which are the partition keys) and rename them to `car_make` and `car_model`.
    *   We calculate the `highest_sale_price` by applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field found within the `sale_records` of the original `Cars` collection belonging to that specific make/model group.
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `ORDER_BY` on the `make_model_max_prices` collection to sort the results based on the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (`DESC()`), placing the make/model combinations with the highest maximum sale prices first.",31.91458868980408,"# Step 1: Filter cars that have been sold and whose latest inventory snapshot indicates they are not in inventory.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains the substring 'ford'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitivity.
3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains the substring 'mustang'.
4.  **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so cars matching either condition are included.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.
6.  **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These select the specified car details directly from the `Cars` collection.
7.  **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which contains all sales associated with the car) and computes the average (`AVG`) of the `sale_price` field within those records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first use the top-level `Dealership` collection to calculate the date boundaries for our analysis using `DATETIME` functions. `current_month_start_dt` is the first moment of the current month, and `six_months_ago_start_dt` is the first moment of the month six months prior.
2.  **`relevant_salespersons`**: We filter the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 and 2023 (inclusive), using the `YEAR()` function.
3.  **`sales_by_relevant_persons`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection for the filtered salespersons.
4.  **`filtered_sales`**: We filter these sales further, keeping only those where the `sale_date` is greater than or equal to `six_months_ago_start_dt` and less than `current_month_start_dt`. This effectively selects sales from the last 6 full months, excluding the current month. The date boundaries calculated in the first step are implicitly available here.
5.  **`sales_with_month`**: We use `CALCULATE` on the `filtered_sales` to create a `sale_month_str` field representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-10"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, and `MONTH`. We also explicitly include `sale_price` so it's available for the subsequent aggregation.
6.  **`monthly_metrics`**: We partition the `sales_with_month` data using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""month_groups""`: Names the partition groups.
    *   `by=(sale_month_str)`: Groups the sales data by the year-month string.
    *   Inside the following `CALCULATE`, we compute:
        *   `month=sale_month_str`: Selects the month string for the output.
        *   `PMSPS=COUNT(month_groups)`: Counts the number of sales records within each month's partition group (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count).
        *   `PMSR=SUM(month_groups.sale_price)`: Sums the `sale_price` of the sales records within each month's partition group (Per Month Sales Revenue).
7.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` to sort the aggregated monthly results chronologically.

*Note*: This query provides results only for months within the specified 6-month period where there was at least one sale made by a salesperson hired between 2022 and 2023.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need an aggregate result across all relevant sales.
2.  **`total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`**: This calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all records in the `Sales` collection where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
3.  **`total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`**: This calculates the sum of the `cost` for the associated `car` for all sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023. It accesses the cost through the `Sales.car` relationship.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the GPM based on the previously calculated totals.
5.  **`gpm_2023 = IFF(total_cost_2023 != 0, (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0, 0.0)`**: This applies the GPM formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
    *   `IFF(total_cost_2023 != 0, ..., 0.0)` is used to prevent division by zero errors. If `total_cost_2023` is not zero, it calculates the GPM; otherwise, it returns `0.0`.
    *   `100.0` is used to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payments_with_month = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, it creates a new field `year_month_str` by concatenating the year and the zero-padded month (e.g., ""2023-05"") from the `payment_date`.
2.  **`monthly_payment_totals = payments_with_month.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the `payments_with_month` data based on the unique values of `year_month_str`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(month_id = year_month_str, monthly_total = SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount))`**: Within each monthly partition (`monthly_groups`), this calculates:
    *   `month_id`: The identifier for the month (e.g., ""2023-05"").
    *   `monthly_total`: The sum of `payment_amount` for all payments belonging to that specific month's partition group. We refer back to `PaymentsReceived.payment_amount` to sum the original values within the group.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(month_id.ASC())`**: This sorts the resulting monthly totals chronologically based on the `month_id` string. This ordering is essential for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the ""previous"" month.
5.  **`result = monthly_payment_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step takes the sorted monthly totals and calculates:
    *   `month`: Renames `month_id` for the final output.
    *   `total_payments_received`: Renames `monthly_total` for the final output.
    *   `mom_change`: Calculates the Month-over-Month change. It uses the `PREV(monthly_total, by=month_id.ASC(), default=0.0)` function to get the `monthly_total` from the immediately preceding record (based on the ascending `month_id` order). It subtracts this previous month's total from the current `monthly_total`. The `default=0.0` ensures that for the very first month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the previous value is treated as 0, so the MoM change is simply the total for that first month.

It navigates from each salesperson to their `sales_made`, then to the `payment` associated with each sale. It checks if any of these payments have a `payment_method` equal to 'cash'. The outer `HAS(...) == 1` ensures that only salespersons with at least one cash payment linked to one of their sales are kept.

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `Sales` collection, as it contains the `sale_price` needed for revenue and links to the `car` information (`make`, `model`).
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to extract the `make` and `model` from the related `car` record (`car.make`, `car.model`) and the `sale_price`, renaming them for clarity within the query (`car_make`, `car_model`, `price`).
3.  We then `PARTITION` the results by `car_make` and `car_model`. This groups all sales records belonging to the same make and model combination.
4.  Inside the `CALCULATE` following the `PARTITION`, we compute the aggregates for each group:
    *   `make=car_make`: Selects the make (from the partition key).
    *   `model=car_model`: Selects the model (from the partition key).
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.price)`: Calculates the sum of the `price` (originally `sale_price`) for all sales within that specific make/model group.
    *   `total_sales=COUNT(Sales)`: Counts the number of sales records within that specific make/model group.
5.  Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` selects the 5 groups (make/model combinations) with the highest `total_revenue`, ordered from highest to lowest. The final result includes the make, model, total revenue, and total sales count for these top 5 models.",25.863315105438232,"# Step 1: Access Sales data and extract the make and model from the related car, along with the sale price.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Dealership` collection.
    *   `start_of_current_week_calc=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the timestamp for the beginning of the current week (assuming Monday start for ISO week).
    *   `start_of_previous_week_calc=DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.

2.  **`previous_week_payments = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   It selects only payments where the `payment_date` is greater than or equal to the calculated `start_of_previous_week_calc` AND less than the `start_of_current_week_calc`. This effectively isolates all payments made during the entire previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday).

3.  **`payments_with_day = previous_week_payments.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step prepares the filtered data for partitioning.
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Extracts the date part (truncating the time) from `payment_date` to allow grouping by day.
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`, `payment_amount=payment_amount`: Carries forward the payment method and amount needed for partitioning and aggregation.

4.  **`daily_payments_by_method = payments_with_day.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the prepared payment data.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups"", by=(payment_day, payment_method)`: Groups the records first by the `payment_day` and then by the `payment_method`.

5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates the final aggregated result for each partition group.
    *   `payment_date_out=payment_day`, `payment_method_out=payment_method`: Selects the partitioning keys (the day and method) for the output.
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific day and payment method group. It refers back to the original collection context within the partition.

6.  **`.ORDER_BY(payment_date_out.ASC(), payment_method_out.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first by date and then by payment method for clarity.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data:**
    *   The code starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters the sales records using `WHERE` to include only those where the `YEAR` of the `sale_date` is 2023.
    *   It then uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `customer.state` and calculate the `quarter_number` (1 for Jan-Mar, 2 for Apr-Jun, etc.) based on the `MONTH` of the `sale_date`. The `sale_price` is also kept for later summation.

2.  **Partition Data:**
    *   The prepared data (`sales_data_for_partition`) is then partitioned using `PARTITION`.
    *   The `name` ""state\_quarter\_groups"" is assigned to the partitioned groups (though not explicitly used later in this query).
    *   The `by` parameter specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique combinations of `customer_state` and `quarter_number`.

3.  **Calculate Results per Group:**
    *   Finally, `CALCULATE` is applied to the partitioned data (`partitioned_sales`). For each group (each unique state and quarter combination):
        *   `state` is assigned the `customer_state` from the partition key.
        *   `q_start_month` calculates the first month number (1, 4, 7, or 10) of the corresponding quarter.
        *   `quarter_date` constructs the string representation of the first date of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01"", ""2023-04-01"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for correct month formatting.
        *   `total_sales` calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records belonging to that specific state and quarter group by using the aggregation function `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.",42.91326427459717,"# 1. Filter sales for the year 2023 and calculate necessary fields for partitioning.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `Dealership` level to calculate a global value: the latest `snapshot_date` that occurred within March 2023.
    *   `InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...)`: We first filter the `InventorySnapshots` collection to include only those records where the `snapshot_date` falls in the year 2023 and the month 3 (March).
    *   `MAX(...)`: We find the maximum (latest) `snapshot_date` among these filtered March 2023 snapshots.
    *   `latest_march_2023_date=...`: This latest date is stored in a new calculated field `latest_march_2023_date`.
2.  **`latest_inventory_snapshots = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection again, leveraging the `latest_march_2023_date` calculated previously.
    *   `WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_march_2023_date) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: We filter these snapshots to keep only those whose `snapshot_date` exactly matches the calculated latest date *and* where the `is_in_inventory` flag is `True`.
3.  **`cars_in_inventory_latest_march_2023 = latest_inventory_snapshots.car.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered snapshots representing cars in inventory on the latest March 2023 snapshot date:
    *   `.car`: We navigate from the `InventorySnapshots` records to their associated `Cars` records using the `car` relationship.

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection because we want a result for each drug.
2.  **`drug_name=drug_name`**: We select the `drug_name` to include it in the final output.
3.  **`average_ddd=AVG(...)`**: We calculate the average DDD using the `AVG` aggregation function.
4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: We access the list of treatments associated with each drug.
5.  **`.WHERE((end_dt != None) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: We filter these treatments based on the definition's requirement: the `end_dt` must not be null, and the treatment duration (calculated as the difference between `end_dt` and `start_dt` in days) must be greater than 0 to avoid division by zero or nonsensical DDD values.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_ddd = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment, we calculate its individual DDD according to the provided formula (`tot_drug_amt` divided by the duration in days).
7.  **`.treatment_ddd`**: We access the `treatment_ddd` value calculated in the previous step. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `treatment_ddd` values for all valid treatments associated with the current drug.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: This calculates the date boundaries for the query. `start_period` is set to the first day of the month, three months prior to the current month. `end_period` is set to the first day of the current month. This defines the time window [start\_period, end\_period).
2.  **`relevant_treatments`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated `start_period` and `end_period`. It then calculates:
    *   `treatment_month`: Formats the treatment start date into a 'YYYY-MM' string for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., '05' instead of '5').
    *   `patient_key`: Extracts the `patient_id` for accurate distinct counting later.
    *   `is_biologic`: A boolean flag indicating if the treatment used a drug with `drug_type` equal to 'biologic'.
3.  **`monthly_patient_counts`**: This partitions the `relevant_treatments` based on the `treatment_month`. For each month's group:
    *   It calculates `distinct_patient_count` using `NDISTINCT` on the `patient_key` of all treatments within that month's partition.
    *   It calculates `distinct_biologic_patient_count` by first filtering the treatments within the partition to only those where `is_biologic` is true, and then applying `NDISTINCT` to their `patient_key`.
4.  **`result`**: This takes the monthly aggregated counts and orders them chronologically by `month`. The final result contains the month, the total distinct patient count for that month, and the distinct count of patients receiving biologic treatments in that month.",28.798162698745728,"# Define the start and end dates for the 3-month period before the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctor_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it calculates their `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`. The `num_distinct_drugs` is computed using `NDISTINCT` on the `drug_id` found within the doctor's `prescribed_treatments`.
2.  **`specialty_groups = doctor_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the results from the previous step (`doctor_drug_counts`) and partitions them into groups based on the `speciality` field. Each group in `specialties` now contains doctors belonging to the same specialty, along with their previously calculated `doc_id` and `num_distinct_drugs`.
3.  **`ranked_doctors_by_specialty = specialty_groups.doctor_drug_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. We access the data within each partition using `specialty_groups.doctor_drug_counts`. For each doctor *within their specialty group*, it selects the `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`. Crucially, it then calculates `SDRSDR` using the `RANKING` window function. Because `RANKING` is applied after partitioning by `speciality`, it computes the rank *within* each specialty group based on `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (as specified by `.DESC()`).
4.  **`result = ranked_doctors_by_specialty`**: The final result containing the `doc_id`, `speciality`, `num_distinct_drugs`, and the calculated rank `SDRSDR` for each doctor is assigned to the `result` variable.",42.507593393325806,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate two key date boundaries using the top-level `DermTreatment` collection:
    *   `current_month_start`: The first moment of the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`).
    *   `start_period`: The first moment of the month 12 months prior to the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-12 months')`).
2.  **`treatments_in_period = time_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter it:
    *   `start_dt >= start_period`: Includes treatments from the start of the 12-month-prior period onwards.
    *   `start_dt < current_month_start`: Excludes any treatments from the current month.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_year=YEAR(start_dt), treatment_month=MONTH(start_dt))`**: For the filtered treatments, we extract the `year` and `month` from their `start_dt` and store them in new fields `treatment_year` and `treatment_month`.
4.  **`monthly_stats = treatments_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `treatments_in_period` data based on the calculated `treatment_year` and `treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same calendar month together.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each monthly partition (`monthly_groups`):
    *   `year=treatment_year`, `month=treatment_month`: We select the year and month identifiers for the output.
    *   `PMPD=NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: We calculate the Per Month Patient Diagnoses (PMPD) by counting the number of *distinct* `patient_id` values found within the `Treatments` belonging to that specific month's partition. We access the patient ID via the `patient` relationship (`Treatments.patient.patient_id`).
    *   `PMTC=COUNT(Treatments)`: We calculate the Per Month Treatment Count (PMTC) by simply counting all the `Treatments` records within that specific month's partition.
6.  **`result = monthly_stats.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting monthly statistics in ascending chronological order, first by year and then by month.",27.56219172477722,"# Calculate the start of the current month and the start of the period 12 months prior

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_info`**: This part identifies the year each patient had their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection and filters out any patients who have never received a treatment using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`.
    *   `CALCULATE(first_treatment_start_dt = MIN(treatments_received.start_dt))` finds the earliest `start_dt` among all treatments associated with each patient.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(first_treatment_yr = YEAR(first_treatment_start_dt))` extracts just the year from that earliest date.

2.  **`yearly_new_patients_count`**: This groups the patients based on the year they became ""new"" (i.e., the year of their first treatment).
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_yr)` groups the results from the previous step by the calculated `first_treatment_yr`.
    *   `CALCULATE(year = first_treatment_yr, num_new_patients = COUNT(Patients))` calculates the results for each group (year):
        *   `year`: The year of the first treatment.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of patients within that specific year group (i.e., the number of patients whose first treatment occurred in that year).

3.  **`npi_calculation`**: This calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI).
    *   It takes the yearly counts calculated previously.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` selects the `year` and `num_new_patients`.
    *   `NPI = num_new_patients - PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)` calculates the NPI. The `PREV` function looks at the `num_new_patients` from the *previous* record when ordered by `year` (ascending). `default=0` handles the very first year in the dataset, ensuring its NPI is calculated as `num_new_patients - 0`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` sorts the final output by year in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`valid_outcomes_for_pasi`**: This intermediate step filters the `Outcomes` collection. It keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null (assuming scores >= 0 implies non-null, as per the requirement to only include patients with scores for both timepoints).
2.  **`avg_scores`**: This step calculates the global average `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` using *only* the records identified in `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`. The calculation is performed at the top `DermTreatment` level to get overall averages.
3.  **`overall_pir`**: This final step calculates the D7D100PIR percentage using the averages computed in the previous step (`avg_pasi_day7` and `avg_pasi_day100`).
    *   It uses the provided formula: `(avg_pasi_day100 - avg_pasi_day7) / avg_pasi_day7 * 100.0`.
    *   The `IFF` function is used to check if `avg_pasi_day7` is not zero before performing the division, preventing potential division-by-zero errors. If it is zero, `None` is returned.
    *   The result is stored in the `d7_d100_pir_percentage` field, which is the only field returned by this final `CALCULATE`.",38.786376953125,"# Define the subset of Outcomes records that have non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to compute new fields for each drug.
2.  **`d_id=drug_id, d_name=drug_name`**: We select the `drug_id` and `drug_name` and assign them to new field names `d_id` and `d_name` respectively.
3.  **`same_month_event_count=SUM(...)`**: This calculates the total count of relevant adverse events for each drug.
4.  **`treatments_used_in.adverse_events`**: We navigate from each `Drug` to its associated `Treatments` (`treatments_used_in`) and then to the `AdverseEvents` linked to those treatments.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(is_same_month=...)`**: For each `AdverseEvent`, we calculate a boolean flag `is_same_month`.
6.  **`(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`**: This condition checks if the year and month of the adverse event's `reported_dt` are the same as the year and month of the corresponding `treatment`'s `start_dt`. Note that `treatment.start_dt` correctly refers to the singular parent treatment of the adverse event in this context.
7.  **`.is_same_month`**: We select the calculated boolean flag.
8.  **`SUM(...)`**: The `SUM` function aggregates the `is_same_month` flags (where True=1, False=0) for all adverse events associated with all treatments for a given drug, effectively counting the events that meet the condition.
9.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=same_month_event_count.DESC())`**: After calculating the count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K` to select the single drug (`k=1`) with the highest `same_month_event_count`, sorting in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_calc = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `DermTreatment` level to calculate a reference date, `start_period_date`. This date represents the beginning of the 6-calendar-month window (the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month).
2.  **`treatments_in_period = date_calc.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter them to include only those whose `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `start_period_date`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_specialty = doctor.speciality)`**: For the filtered treatments, we calculate `doc_specialty` by accessing the `speciality` of the linked `doctor`. This makes the specialty available as a field for partitioning.
4.  **`specialty_agg = treatments_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered treatments based on the `doc_specialty` calculated in the previous step. This groups all treatments prescribed by doctors of the same specialty together.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each partition group (i.e., for each specialty), we calculate:
    *   `specialty = doc_specialty`: The name of the specialty (from the partition key).
    *   `number_of_treatments = COUNT(Treatments)`: The total count of treatments belonging to this specialty group (and within the time window).
    *   `total_drug_amount_prescribed = SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: The sum of the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within this specialty group.
6.  **`top_specialties_by_drug_amount = specialty_agg.TOP_K(...)`**: We take the results from the partitioning and aggregation step and select the top 3 records based on the `total_drug_amount_prescribed` in descending order.
7.  **`result = top_specialties_by_drug_amount`**: The final result containing the top 3 specialties, their treatment counts, and total drug amounts is assigned to the `result` variable.",26.56200861930847,"# Calculate the start date: 6 calendar months prior to the start of the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need a single aggregated count across the entire dataset.
2.  **`COUNT(Treatments.WHERE(...))`**: We count the number of records in the `Treatments` collection that satisfy the conditions specified within the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This filters treatments linked to a diagnosis whose name (`diag_name`) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. `LOWER()` makes the comparison case-insensitive, and `%` acts as a wildcard.
4.  **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the drug associated with the treatment has a non-null FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`), indicating it has been FDA-approved.
5.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This filters treatments whose end date (`end_dt`) falls within the last 6 months. It checks if the end date is strictly after the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`).

2.  **`first_treatment_info = doctors_filtered.prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `prescribed_treatments` for the filtered doctors. It then uses `WHERE` with the `RANKING` function to find the earliest treatment for each doctor (`per=""Doctors""`) based on ascending `start_dt`. Only the treatment ranked first (`== 1`) is kept. `.SINGULAR()` is used to treat the single resulting treatment per doctor as a singular record.
3.  **`result = doctors_filtered.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step selects the required fields. It takes the `last_name` and `year_reg` directly from the filtered `doctors_filtered` context.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the treatments based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   **`is_placebo_flag == True`**: Selects only treatments where `is_placebo` is true.
    *   **`HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks for the existence of related concomitant medications that meet specific criteria.
        *   **`concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each treatment.
        *   **`(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start_date, start_dt) >= 0)`**: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment began. `treatment_start_date` refers to the parent treatment's start date, and `start_dt` refers to the concomitant med's start date.
        *   **`(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start_date, start_dt) <= 14)`**: Ensures the concomitant medication started within 14 days (inclusive) of the treatment's start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the average age).
2.  **`avg_male_private_age=AVG(...)`**: We define the final output field `avg_male_private_age` and use the `AVG` aggregation function to calculate the average.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we target the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'male') & (ins_type == 'private')`**: This is the filter condition. It selects patients whose `gender` is 'male' AND whose `ins_type` is 'private'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, 'now'))`**: For the filtered patients, we calculate a new temporary field `age_in_years`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date (`'now'`).
6.  **`.age_in_years`**: Finally, we provide the calculated `age_in_years` field to the `AVG` function, so it computes the average of the ages for only the male patients with private insurance.",16.754417419433594,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it to include only those merchants who have received at least one transaction marked as 'completed'. This pre-filtering avoids unnecessary calculations for merchants with no relevant transaction history.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""merchant_group"", by=(mid))`**: We partition the filtered merchants based on their unique merchant ID (`mid`). This creates groups, one for each merchant.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each merchant's partition group, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Retrieves the merchant's name.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s found in the `transactions_received` sub-collection for that specific merchant, but only considering transactions where the `status` is 'completed' and a `coupon_id` actually exists (`HAS(coupon_id)==1`).
    *   `distinct_transactions`: Counts the number of unique `txid`s (transactions) in the `transactions_received` sub-collection for that merchant, again only considering those with `status` 'completed'.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` takes the results from the previous step and:
    *   Selects the `merchant_name`.
    *   Calculates the `cpur` (Coupon Usage Rate) by dividing `distinct_coupons_used` by `distinct_transactions`.
    *   Uses the `IFF` function to handle potential division by zero: if `distinct_transactions` is greater than 0, it performs the division; otherwise, it returns `0.0`.
5.  **`result = ...`**: The final result, containing the merchant name and their calculated CPUR, is assigned to the `result` variable.",34.72623562812805,"result = Merchants.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Ewallet` collection:
    *   `start_current_week`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `start_of_period`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week, 3 weeks prior to the current week.
2.  **`relevant_users = date_boundaries.Users.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Users` collection to include only those whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"" using the `ISIN` function.
3.  **`notification_info = relevant_users.notifications.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We access the `notifications` sub-collection for the filtered users.
    *   We filter these notifications using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the desired period (greater than or equal to `start_of_period` and less than `start_current_week`).
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to derive two new fields for each notification:
        *   `notification_week`: The date truncated to the start of the week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`.
        *   `is_weekend`: A boolean (True/1 or False/0) indicating if the notification's `created_at` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
4.  **`weekly_notification_summary = notification_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`**:
    *   We partition the `notification_info` collection using `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=(notification_week))`. This groups the notifications based on the week they were sent.
    *   For each group (each week), we use `CALCULATE` to compute:
        *   `week_start_date`: The starting date of the week (same as the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications`: The total count of notifications within that week's partition, obtained using `COUNT(Notifications)`.
        *   `weekend_notifications`: The count of notifications sent on weekends within that week. This is calculated by summing the `is_weekend` boolean flag (which evaluates to 1 for True/weekend and 0 for False/weekday) using `SUM(weeks.is_weekend)`. We access the calculated `is_weekend` field via the partition name `weeks`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`us_transactions_last_7_days = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on three conditions combined with the logical AND operator (`&`):
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures the transaction was initiated by a user (not a merchant).
    *   `sending_user.country == ""US""`: Filters transactions where the sending user's country is ""US"". It accesses the `country` attribute through the `sending_user` relationship.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: Filters transactions created within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", ..., ...)` calculates the difference in full days. `<= 6` ensures we include today (0 days difference) and the previous 6 days.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days (inclusive) compared to the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  **`user_amb = recent_user_balances.PARTITION(name=""user_group"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(...)`**: This partitions the filtered balances by `user_id`. For each unique user in the filtered set, it calculates their average balance during that period using `avg_balance_per_user=AVG(UserBalances.balance)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(HAS(balances)==1)`**: Starts with the `Users` collection and filters it to include only users who have at least one balance record in the `UserBalances` collection (using `HAS(balances)==1`).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the desired output fields for each user who passed the filter.
3.  **`user_identifier=uid`**: Selects the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and renames it to `user_identifier`.
4.  **`latest_user_balance=balances.TOP_K(1, by=updated_at.DESC()).SINGULAR().balance`**: This calculates the Latest User Balance (LUB):
    *   `balances`: Accesses the list of balance records associated with the current user.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection because we need information for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's ID and name it `user_id`.
3.  **`marketing_opt_in_status=...`**: We define the second field we need, the marketing opt-in status.
4.  **`Users.setting_snapshots`**: For each user, we access their related setting snapshots.
5.  **`.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**: We filter these snapshots.
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This ranks the snapshots *for each user* (`per=""Users""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first).
    *   `== 1`: This condition keeps only the snapshot with rank 1, which is the latest one for that specific user.
6.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause guarantees that only one snapshot (the latest) is selected for each user, `.SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record, allowing direct access to its fields.
7.  **`.marketing_opt_in`**: We access the `marketing_opt_in` field from the single, latest snapshot identified in the previous steps.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenue = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Merchants` collection and calculates intermediate values for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `total_revenue=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount), 0.0)`: This calculates the total revenue for each merchant.
        *   It accesses the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant.
        *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where the `status` is 'completed' (indicating success) and the `receiver_type` is 1 (as specified in the request).
        *   `SUM(...)` aggregates the `amount` of these filtered transactions.
        *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that merchants with no qualifying transactions get a `total_revenue` of 0 instead of potentially null, which helps in ranking.
2.  **`merchant_mrr = merchant_revenue.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the results from the previous calculation and adds the revenue rank.
    *   It carries over `merchant_name`, `merchant_category`.
    *   `revenue_amount=total_revenue`: Renames `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` for the final output.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This applies the `RANKING` window function. It ranks the merchants based on the `total_revenue` calculated in the previous step. `DESC()` ensures that the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary date boundaries using the `DATETIME` function based on the current time (`'now'`).
    *   `start_of_current_month`: Finds the first moment of the current month. This serves as the *exclusive* end date for our target period.
    *   `start_of_target_period`: Finds the first moment of the month that started two months before the current month. This is the *inclusive* start date. For example, if it's July, this calculates May 1st.
2.  **`transactions_in_period = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It selects transactions where `created_at` falls within the calculated `start_of_target_period` (inclusive) and `start_of_current_month` (exclusive).
    *   It further filters for transactions where `sender_type == 0`, as specified in the PMDAU definition (assuming 0 represents a user).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this step prepares the data for partitioning.
    *   `transaction_month`: Creates a 'YYYY-MM' string representation of the transaction month using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure months like '05' instead of '5'). This will be the key for grouping.
    *   `sender_id`: Explicitly includes `sender_id` so it can be referenced in the aggregation step.
4.  **`pmdau_calculation = transactions_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered transaction data.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(transaction_month)`: Groups the transactions based on the calculated `transaction_month`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step performs the aggregation within each monthly partition group.
    *   `month=transaction_month`: Selects the month identifier for the output.
    *   `pmdau=NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: Calculates the Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) by counting the number of distinct `sender_id` values within each `monthly_groups` partition. It refers back to the `sender_id` from the `Transactions` collection context within the partition.

    *   **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and rename it to `user_id` in the output.
    *   **`total_sent_transactions=COUNT(transactions_sent)`**: We use the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_sent` sub-collection (which lists transactions sent by the user).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sessions_in_range = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `UserSessions` collection. It then filters these sessions using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `session_start_ts` is on or after `2023-06-01` and strictly before `2023-06-08`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this calculates two fields for each valid session:
    *   `user_id=user_id`: Selects the `user_id` associated with the session, which is needed for grouping later.
    *   `session_duration_sec=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the duration of the individual session in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between the session start and end timestamps.
3.  **`user_total_durations = sessions_in_range.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered sessions (with their calculated durations) and partitions them.
    *   `name=""user_sessions_group""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(user_id)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the `user_id`, effectively grouping all sessions belonging to the same user.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each user group created by the partition:
    *   `user_id=user_id`: Selects the `user_id` (which is the key of the partition).
    *   `total_duration_seconds=SUM(user_sessions_group.session_duration_sec)`: Calculates the total session duration for the user by summing (`SUM`) the `session_duration_sec` of all sessions within that user's group (`user_sessions_group`).
5.  **`result = user_total_durations.ORDER_BY(...)`**: Finally, this sorts the results (which now contain one row per user with their total duration) based on the `total_duration_seconds` field in descending order (`DESC()`), placing users with the longest total session duration first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by calculating the necessary date boundaries using the `DATETIME` function relative to the current time ('now').
    *   `start_of_current_month`: Finds the first moment of the current month.
    *   `start_of_previous_month`: Finds the first moment of the month *before* the current one.
2.  **`prev_month_wallet_transactions = date_info.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection through the `date_info` context (which contains our calculated dates). We then filter these transactions based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `transaction_type == 'wallet'`: Selects only transactions designated as 'wallet' type.
    *   `created_at >= start_of_previous_month`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of the previous month.
    *   `created_at < start_of_current_month`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current month, effectively capturing the entire previous month.
3.  **`transaction_counts = date_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: We calculate the necessary counts based on the filtered transactions:
    *   `total_transactions = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions)`: Counts all transactions that met the criteria in the previous step.
    *   `successful_transactions = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions.WHERE(status == 'completed'))`: Counts only those transactions from the filtered set where the `status` is 'completed' (assuming 'completed' signifies success).
4.  **`result = transaction_counts.CALCULATE(...)`**: We calculate the final Success Transaction Rate (STR).
    *   `IFF(total_transactions > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This checks if there were any transactions in the previous month (`total_transactions > 0`).
    *   If `total_transactions` is greater than 0, it calculates `100.0 * successful_transactions / total_transactions` to get the percentage STR. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division.
    *   If `total_transactions` is 0 (meaning no wallet transactions occurred last month), it returns `0.0` to avoid division by zero.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(previous_month_str=previous_month_str)`**: This final `CALCULATE` ensures that only the computed `previous_month_str` value is returned in the result.",30.65660572052002,"# Calculate the start of the current month and the start of the previous month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_creation_info = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Merchants` collection and calculates the year and month the merchant was created using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions on the `created_at` field. It also selects the merchant's `mid` and `name`, renaming `mid` to `merchant_mid` for clarity.
2.  **`merchant_coupon_counts = merchant_creation_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the results from the previous step. For each merchant, it calculates `same_month_coupon_count` by:
    *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
    *   Filtering these coupons using `WHERE` to keep only those where the coupon's `created_at` year and month match the `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` calculated in the previous step.
    *   Counting the remaining coupons using `COUNT()`.
    *   It also passes through the `merchant_mid` and `merchant_name`.
3.  **`top_merchant = merchant_coupon_counts.WHERE(...).TOP_K(...)`**: This step filters out any merchants who had zero coupons created in their creation month (`WHERE(same_month_coupon_count > 0)`). Then, it uses `TOP_K(1, by=same_month_coupon_count.DESC())` to find the single merchant with the highest `same_month_coupon_count`.
4.  **`result = top_merchant.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step selects and renames the required fields (`merchant_id`, `merchant_name`, `num_coupons`) from the single top merchant identified in the previous step.",30.64804697036743,"# Calculate the creation year and month for each merchant

**Explanation:**

3.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This condition checks if the user has at least one notification that meets the nested criteria:
    *   **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for the current user and filters them.
    *   **`(status == 'unread') & (notification_type == 'promotional')`**: Filters the notifications to include only those where the `status` is exactly 'unread' AND the `notification_type` is exactly 'promotional'.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`: Extracts the date corresponding to the first day of the month the transaction occurred. This standardizes the date for monthly grouping.
    *   `user_uid = sending_user.uid`: Retrieves the unique ID (`uid`) of the sending user, which is necessary for counting distinct users later.
3.  **`filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_transactions` data.
    *   `name=""monthly_transactions""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(transaction_month_start)`: Groups the transactions based on the calculated `transaction_month_start`.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each monthly partition group, we calculate the final results:
    *   `month_date = transaction_month_start`: Selects the month date (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_active_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: Counts the number of unique sending user IDs (`uid`) within each month's group of transactions. We use `NDISTINCT` on the original path `Transactions.sending_user.uid` as per PyDough aggregation rules within partitions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country))`**: This groups all users based on their `country`. Each group represents a unique country.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step performs calculations for each country group created by the partition.
    *   **`country=country`**: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
    *   **`num_distinct_users_who_sent=COUNT(Users.WHERE(HAS(transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)) == 1))`**: This calculates the number of distinct users within the current country group. It first filters the `Users` sub-collection (users belonging to this country) to include only those who have (`HAS(...) == 1`) at least one sent transaction (`transactions_sent`) where the `sender_type` is 0. Then, `COUNT` counts these filtered users.
    *   **`total_transaction_amount=SUM(Users.transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0).amount)`**: This calculates the total amount sent by users from this country. It accesses the `transactions_sent` for all users within the current country group, filters these transactions to keep only those with `sender_type == 0`, accesses their `amount`, and calculates the `SUM`.
3.  **`.WHERE(total_transaction_amount > 0)`**: This filters out any countries where the calculated `total_transaction_amount` is zero or less, ensuring only countries with actual sending activity (of type 0) are considered.
4.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**: This selects the top 5 country groups based on the `total_transaction_amount`, ordered from highest to lowest.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it to include only those merchants who have received at least one transaction matching the criteria using `HAS(...) == 1`. This avoids calculating aggregates for merchants with no relevant transactions.
2.  **`transactions_received.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `HAS`, `SUM`, and `COUNT` functions, we access the transactions received by each merchant (`transactions_received`). We then filter these transactions:
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: Ensures the transaction was intended for a merchant receiver.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150`: Filters for transactions created within the last 150 days (inclusive) relative to the current time (`'now'`).
3.  **`CALCULATE(...)`**: For each merchant passing the initial `WHERE` filter:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `total_received_amount=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all filtered transactions received by that specific merchant.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of filtered transactions received by that specific merchant.
4.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=total_received_amount.DESC())`**: Selects the top 2 merchants based on the calculated `total_received_amount`, ordered in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters out merchants who do not have any associated coupons using the `HAS` function.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the remaining merchants, this step calculates intermediate values:
    *   `merchant_id_val=mid`: Stores the merchant's ID.
    *   `registration_date_val=created_at`: Stores the merchant's creation/registration date.
    *   `earliest_coupon=coupons.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1).SINGULAR()`: This finds the *single* earliest coupon for each merchant.
        *   `coupons`: Accesses the list of coupons for the current merchant.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"")`: Ranks the coupons *within each merchant's group* based on their `start_date` in ascending order. The earliest date gets rank 1. `per=""Merchants""` ensures the ranking is done separately for each merchant.
        *   `.WHERE(...) == 1`: Filters to keep only the coupon(s) with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Explicitly selects the single resulting earliest coupon record, allowing direct access to its fields (`cid`, `start_date`).
3.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", registration_date_val, earliest_coupon.start_date) <= 365)`**: Filters the results further, keeping only those merchants where the time difference (in days) between their registration date (`registration_date_val`) and their earliest coupon's start date (`earliest_coupon.start_date`) is less than or equal to 365 days (i.e., within one year).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects and renames the final required fields for the output:
    *   `merchant_id=merchant_id_val`
    *   `registration_date=registration_date_val`
    *   `earliest_coupon_id=earliest_coupon.cid`

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
2.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 0`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `notifications`: Accesses the list of notifications associated with each user.
    *   `.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) < 365)`: Filters these notifications.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at)`: Calculates the difference in days between the user's signup date (`Users.created_at`) and the notification's creation date (`created_at` within the `notifications` context).
        *   `< 365`: Checks if this difference is less than 365 days (i.e., within the first year).
    *   `HAS(...)`: Checks if *any* notification exists for the user that meets the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., was created within the first year).
    *   `== 0`: The outer condition selects only those users for whom the `HAS` check returns false (0), meaning they have *no* notifications created within their first year.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who pass the filter, we select and rename the required fields:
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username`.
    *   `user_email=email`: Selects the `email`.
    *   `signup_date=created_at`: Selects the user's creation date (`created_at` from the `Users` context).
