**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. Inside the first `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Select the customer's name (`cust_name=name`).
    *   Count the total number of transactions for each customer using `total_transactions=COUNT(transactions)`.
    *   Count only the successful transactions by filtering the `transactions` sub-collection where the `status` field is equal to 'S' (assuming 'S' stands for Success) using `successful_transactions=COUNT(transactions.WHERE(status == 'S'))`.
2.  **`.WHERE(total_transactions >= 5)`**: We filter the results from the previous step to include only those customers who have 5 or more total transactions.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: In the second `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Select the customer's name again for the final output (`customer_name=cust_name`).
    *   Calculate the `success_rate` by dividing the `successful_transactions` by the `total_transactions`. We multiply `successful_transactions` by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division, resulting in a rate between 0.0 and 1.0.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting collection in ascending order based on the calculated `success_rate`.",20.404700756073,"# Calculate total and successful transactions per customer

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies for easier reference in the query.
2.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute a single aggregated result.
3.  **`distinct_customer_count=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `distinct_customer_count` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function.
4.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition filters for customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
6.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines the two filtering conditions.
7.  **`HAS(Transactions.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if a customer has at least one related record in their `Transactions` sub-collection that meets the inner `WHERE` condition.
8.  **`Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`**: This filters the transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` tuple (i.e., it's a FAANG stock).
9.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy both conditions defined in the outer `WHERE` clause, effectively giving the count of distinct customers meeting the criteria.",17.465044736862183,"# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
