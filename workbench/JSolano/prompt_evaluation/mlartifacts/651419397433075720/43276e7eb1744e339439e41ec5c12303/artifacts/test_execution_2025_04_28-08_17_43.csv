**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatment_ddd_info = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and filter it to include only treatments where:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: The `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as required by the definition.
    *   `start_dt != end_dt`: The start and end dates are different, ensuring the treatment duration is not zero to prevent division by zero errors when calculating DDD.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered treatment, we calculate:
    *   `drug_name=drug.drug_name`: We retrieve the name of the drug associated with the treatment via the `drug` relationship. This is needed for grouping later.
    *   `ddd_per_treatment=(...)`: We calculate the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for this specific treatment according to the provided formula: `tot_drug_amt` divided by the treatment duration in days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`).
3.  **`drug_groups = treatment_ddd_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `treatment_ddd_info` collection.
    *   `name=""drug_group""`: We name the partitions (groups) ""drug\_group"".
    *   `by=(drug_name)`: We group the treatments based on their `drug_name`. All treatments for the same drug will be in the same partition.
4.  **`avg_ddd_per_drug = drug_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform calculations on each partition (each drug group).
    *   `drug_name=drug_name`: We select the `drug_name` (which is the partition key).
    *   `avg_ddd=AVG(Treatments.ddd_per_treatment)`: We calculate the average DDD for the drug. `AVG()` operates on the `ddd_per_treatment` values calculated earlier for all treatments belonging to the current partition (drug group). We access these values through `Treatments.ddd_per_treatment` because the `PARTITION` context allows accessing the original collection's data within the group.
5.  **`result = avg_ddd_per_drug`**: The final result, containing the drug name and its corresponding average DDD, is assigned to the `result` variable.",29.79942297935486,"# Calculate DDD for each relevant treatment first

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the `DermTreatment` high-level collection. `current_month_start` is the first day of the current month, and `prev_month_3_start` is the first day of the month three months prior to the current month.
2.  **`treatments_in_period`**: We access the `Treatments` collection via `date_boundaries` (to use the calculated dates). We filter treatments using `WHERE` to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the desired range (from `prev_month_3_start` up to, but not including, `current_month_start`). We then use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Create a `treatment_month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format.
    *   Extract the `patient_id` as `patient_key` for later distinct counting.
    *   Extract the `drug_type` as `treatment_drug_type` for filtering biologics.
3.  **`monthly_patient_counts`**: We partition the `treatments_in_period` collection by the calculated `treatment_month`. Within each partition (each month):
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to output the `month`.
    *   `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)` counts the unique patient IDs among all treatments within that month's partition.
    *   `NDISTINCT(Treatments.WHERE(treatment_drug_type == 'biologic').patient_key)` first filters the treatments within the partition to only include those where the `treatment_drug_type` is 'biologic', and *then* counts the unique patient IDs associated with those filtered biologic treatments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need a single aggregated count.
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_patients` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function, which will count the number of records in the collection passed to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `treatments_received`: For each patient, we look at their list of received treatments.
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments based on the conditions inside.
    *   `(diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`: Checks if the diagnosis linked to the treatment has the name 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
    *   `&`: Logical AND combines the two conditions.

    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the inner `WHERE` clause returns at least one treatment record for the current patient that satisfies both conditions.
5.  The `COUNT` function then counts how many `Patients` records satisfy the `WHERE` condition (i.e., have received at least one treatment matching both criteria). The result is the distinct count of such patients.",19.152591466903687,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors.PARTITION(name=""spec_group"", by=(speciality))`**: This groups the `Doctors` collection into partitions based on their `speciality`. Each partition (`spec_group`) contains all doctors belonging to a specific specialty.
2.  **`.Doctors`**: After partitioning, we access the doctors *within* each `spec_group`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first one)**: For each doctor within a specialty group, we calculate:
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `speciality=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty (available because it's the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: Calculates the count of unique drugs prescribed by navigating through the doctor's `prescribed_treatments` to the associated `drug` and counting the distinct `drug_id`s.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second one)**: This takes the results from the previous step and calculates the final rank:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_info`**: This variable calculates the year each patient received their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)` filters out patients who have never received any treatment.
    *   `CALCULATE` computes `first_treatment_year` by finding the minimum (`MIN`) `start_dt` among all `treatments_received` for each patient and extracting the `YEAR` from that date. It also keeps `patient_id` for counting purposes later.
2.  **`yearly_new_patients_count`**: This variable groups the patients by their first treatment year and counts them.
    *   It takes the `patient_first_treatment_info` collection as input.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year)` groups the records based on the `first_treatment_year`.
    *   `CALCULATE` then computes:
        *   `year`: The first treatment year for the group.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count (`COUNT`) of patients within each year's partition group, representing the number of new patients for that year. We count the records from the input collection (`patient_first_treatment_info`) that fall into this partition.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically, which is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly in the next step.
3.  **`npi_result`**: This final variable calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI).
    *   It takes the sorted `yearly_new_patients_count` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `year`: The year.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients for that year.
        *   `npi`: The New Patient Increase. This is calculated by subtracting the number of new patients from the previous year (`PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's `num_new_patients`. `PREV` looks back one record based on the ascending order of `year`. `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the dataset, the NPI is calculated as `num_new_patients - 0`.",26.093152046203613,"# Step 1: Find the year of the first treatment for each patient

**Explanation:**

1.  **`drug_ae_counts = Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection and calculate new fields for each drug.
2.  **`d_id=drug_id, d_name=drug_name`**: We temporarily store `drug_id` and `drug_name` in new variables (`d_id`, `d_name`) to avoid naming conflicts in the final output step.
3.  **`num_relevant_aes=SUM(...)`**: This calculates the total count of relevant adverse events for the current drug.
4.  **`treatments_used_in.adverse_events.CALCULATE(...)`**: We navigate from the drug to its associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`) and then to the adverse events (`adverse_events`) linked to those treatments. Inside this nested `CALCULATE`, we evaluate each adverse event individually.
5.  **`is_same_month_event=IFF(...)`**: For each adverse event, we use the `IFF` function to check the condition:
    *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`: This checks if the year and month of the adverse event's `reported_dt` are the same as the year and month of the corresponding treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   If the condition is true, `IFF` returns `1`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
6.  **`).is_same_month_event`**: After the nested `CALCULATE`, we access the `is_same_month_event` result (which is 1 or 0).
7.  **`SUM(...)`**: The `SUM` function aggregates these 1s and 0s across all adverse events associated with the current drug via its treatments, effectively counting only those events that meet the same-month condition.
8.  **`top_drug_by_ae = drug_ae_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_aes.DESC())`**: We take the results from the previous step (`drug_ae_counts`) and use `TOP_K(1)` to select the single drug (`k=1`) that has the highest `num_relevant_aes` count. `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest value.
9.  **`result = top_drug_by_ae.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select the required fields from the top drug record, renaming `d_id` back to `drug_id`, `d_name` to `drug_name`, and `num_relevant_aes` to `num_adverse_events` for the final output.",32.461629152297974,"# Calculate the count of relevant adverse events for each drug

**Explanation:**

1.  `Doctors.WHERE(...)`: We start with the `Doctors` collection and filter it.
2.  `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1`: This is the filter condition. It checks if a doctor `HAS` at least one (`== 1`) record in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause.
3.  `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')`: This inner filter selects only those treatments (`prescribed_treatments`) where the associated `drug` has a `drug_type` equal to 'Biologic'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_2022 = Treatments.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)`**: This line filters the `Treatments` collection to include only those records where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022.
2.  **`treatments_with_details = treatments_2022.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the filtered treatments and calculates two new fields necessary for the next steps:
    *   `ins_type = patient.ins_type`: Retrieves the insurance type from the related `patient` record for each treatment.
    *   `patient_id = patient.patient_id`: Retrieves the patient ID, which will be used later to count distinct patients.
3.  **`partitioned_by_insurance = treatments_with_details.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the intermediate results (`treatments_with_details`) into groups based on the `ins_type` field calculated previously. Each group (`insurance_groups`) contains all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.
4.  **`insurance_stats = partitioned_by_insurance.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition (each insurance type group) created in the previous step:
    *   `insurance_type = ins_type`: Selects the insurance type (the partition key).
    *   `avg_pasi_day100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` by accessing the `outcome_records` associated with the treatments within the current insurance type group. The `AVG` function handles the aggregation across potentially multiple outcome records per treatment and multiple treatments per group.
    *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id` values within the current insurance type group, giving the distinct patient count for that insurance type.
5.  **`top_5_ins_types = insurance_stats.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_day100.ASC())`**: This selects the top 5 records from the `insurance_stats` collection, ordering them by the `avg_pasi_day100` in ascending order (`ASC()`), meaning the lowest average scores come first.

        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the count).
2.  **`num_qualifying_treatments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_qualifying_treatments` and assign it the count of treatments that meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition filters treatments based on their associated diagnosis.
    *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment.
    *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Checks if the lowercase diagnosis name contains the substring 'psoriasis'. The `%` acts as a wildcard.
5.  **`(drug.fda_appr_dt != None)`**: This condition filters treatments based on their associated drug. It checks if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field for the linked drug is not null, implying the drug has been FDA-approved.
6.  **`(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This condition filters treatments based on their end date (`end_dt`).
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: Gets the current date and time.
    *   The combined condition ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` falls within the range from 6 months ago up to and including the current moment.
7.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines all three conditions, meaning a treatment must satisfy all of them to be included in the count.
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the number of `Treatments` records that remain after applying all the filters.",23.0241596698761,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_reg_year_calc = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(target_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2)`**: Calculates the target registration year by subtracting 2 from the current year obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`. This value is stored in the `target_year` variable within the `target_reg_year_calc` context.
2.  **`doctors_filtered = target_reg_year_calc.Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `Doctors` collection through the context containing the `target_year`. It filters doctors based on two conditions:
    *   `year_reg == target_year`: Selects doctors whose registration year matches the calculated target year.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`: Ensures that only doctors who have prescribed at least one treatment are included.
3.  **`first_treatment_for_doctor = doctors_filtered.prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`**: Navigates to the `prescribed_treatments` for the filtered doctors. It then filters these treatments using:
    *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1`: Ranks the treatments for *each doctor* (`per=""Doctors""`) based on their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `WHERE` clause selects only the treatment with rank 1 (the earliest one).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking filter guarantees only one treatment (the first) per doctor, `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record, allowing its fields to be accessed directly in the final `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`result = doctors_filtered.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects the final output fields from the `doctors_filtered` collection:
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Retrieves the doctor's last name.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We begin by accessing the `AdverseEvents` collection, as the primary focus is on the adverse events themselves.
2.  **`WHERE(...)`**: We filter these events based on their timing relative to the associated treatment's start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`qualifying_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Treatments` collection and applies filters:
    *   `is_placebo == True`: Filters for treatments that are placebos.
    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds) == 1`: Ensures the treatment has at least one associated concomitant medication record.
    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Treatments.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)) == 1`: This is the core condition. It checks if there exists (`HAS(...) == 1`) at least one record within the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection where the difference in days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", ...)` ) between the treatment's start date (`Treatments.start_dt`) and the concomitant med's start date (`start_dt`) is less than or equal to 14 days (2 weeks).
2.  **`relevant_concomitant_meds = qualifying_treatments.concomitant_meds`**: After filtering the treatments, this line accesses the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection *for only those treatments* that met the criteria. This gives us all concomitant medications associated with the qualifying placebo treatments.
3.  **`result = relevant_concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step selects the desired output fields for each concomitant medication record obtained in the previous step:
    *   `treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`: Retrieves the ID of the parent treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_date = treatment.start_dt`: Retrieves the start date of the parent treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_date = treatment.end_dt`: Retrieves the end date of the parent treatment.
    *   `concomitant_med_start_date = start_dt`: Retrieves the start date of the specific concomitant medication record.
    *   `concomitant_med_end_date = end_dt`: Retrieves the end date of the specific concomitant medication record.

The final `result` will contain one row for each concomitant medication associated with a placebo treatment where at least one of the concomitant meds started within two weeks of the treatment's start date. Each row includes details about the treatment and the specific concomitant med.",23.89808940887451,"# Filter treatments to find those that are placebos and have at least one concomitant med starting within 14 days of the treatment start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want to compute a single aggregate value (the average age) across a subset of patients.
2.  **`average_age=AVG(...)`**: We define the output field `average_age` using the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside `AVG`, we target the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: The filter condition selects only patients whose `gender` is 'Male' AND whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`**: For each patient passing the filter, we calculate their current age in full years using `DATEDIFF`. We compare their `date_of_birth` with the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) and specify ""years"" as the unit. This calculated age is stored temporarily as `age_in_years`.
6.  **`.age_in_years`**: We access the `age_in_years` value calculated in the previous step. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `age_in_years` values from all the filtered male patients with private insurance. `DATEDIFF` with ""years"" naturally provides the integer age.",19.658382415771484,"# Calculate the average age for male patients with private insurance
