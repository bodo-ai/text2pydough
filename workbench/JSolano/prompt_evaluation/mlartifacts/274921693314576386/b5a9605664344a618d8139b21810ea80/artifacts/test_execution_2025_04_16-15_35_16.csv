**1. Function Selection & Justification:**

*   **`Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`**: We need to start by filtering the `Sales` collection to only include sales where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
*   **`.payment`**: Access the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection linked to these filtered sales.
*   **`DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`**: This function is needed to determine the starting date of the week for each payment. This will be our grouping key.
*   **`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`**: This gives us the starting date of the current week, which we need as a reference point.
*   **`DATEDIFF(""weeks"", date1, date2)`**: We'll use this to calculate the difference in weeks between the payment's week start date and the current week's start date.
*   **`.WHERE((DATEDIFF(...) >= 1) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 8))`**: This filters the payments to include only those that occurred in the 8 weeks immediately preceding the current week.
*   **`DAYOFWEEK(payment_date)`**: This function (assuming it exists and returns 1-7 for Mon-Sun or similar) is needed to identify if a payment occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). We'll assume Saturday=6 and Sunday=7 for this calculation.
*   **`CALCULATE(is_weekend = ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (6, 7)))`**: We create a boolean flag `is_weekend` for each payment based on the day of the week.
*   **`PARTITION(..., name='weekly_group', by=payment_week_start)`**: This function is essential to group the filtered payments by their respective week start dates.
*   **`CALCULATE(..., total_payments_received=COUNT(weekly_group), weekend_payments_received=SUM(weekly_group.is_weekend))`**: Within each weekly partition, we calculate the total count of payments and the sum of the `is_weekend` flags (which effectively counts weekend payments).
*   **`.ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the results by the week start date in ascending order.

**2. Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is necessary here to group payments by week. We will partition the relevant `PaymentsReceived` records by the calculated `payment_week_start` date.

**3. Code Generation:**

```python
# Define the start of the current week for reference
current_week_start_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')

# Filter sales, access payments, calculate week start and weekend flag, and filter by week
relevant_payments = Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000).payment.CALCULATE(
    payment_week_start = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week'),
    # Assuming DAYOFWEEK returns 6 for Saturday and 7 for Sunday
    is_weekend_payment = ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (6, 7))
).WHERE(
    # Calculate weeks ago relative to the start of the current week
    (DATEDIFF(""weeks"", payment_week_start, current_week_start_date) >= 1) &
    (DATEDIFF(""weeks"", payment_week_start, current_week_start_date) <= 8)
)

# Partition by week start date and calculate aggregates
weekly_payment_summary = PARTITION(
    relevant_payments,
    name='weekly_group',
    by=payment_week_start

    week_start=payment_week_start,
    total_payments_received=COUNT(weekly_group),
    weekend_payments_received=SUM(weekly_group.is_weekend_payment)
).ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())

```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  **`current_week_start_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`**: Defines a variable holding the start date of the current week.
2.  **`Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`**: Selects only sales records where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000.
3.  **`.payment`**: Accesses the associated payment records for these high-value sales.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each payment record:
    *   `payment_week_start = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Calculates the date corresponding to the start of the week the payment was made.
    *   `is_weekend_payment = ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (6, 7))`: Creates a flag (True/False) indicating if the payment date falls on a Saturday (6) or Sunday (7).
5.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters these calculated payment records further:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""weeks"", payment_week_start, current_week_start_date)`: Calculates how many full weeks have passed between the payment's week start and the current week's start.
    *   `( ... >= 1) & ( ... <= 8)`: Keeps only payments whose week start date falls within the last 1 to 8 weeks relative to the current week's start date (effectively, the 8 weeks prior to the current week).
6.  **`PARTITION(...)`**: Groups the filtered `relevant_payments` based on the unique `payment_week_start` dates.
    *   `name='weekly_group'`: Assigns a name to access records within each group.
    *   `by=payment_week_start`: Specifies the field to group by.
7.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each weekly group:
    *   `week_start=payment_week_start`: Selects the week start date (the partition key).
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(weekly_group)`: Counts the total number of payments in that week's group.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(weekly_group.is_weekend_payment)`: Sums the `is_weekend_payment` flag within the group. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in sums, this counts the payments that occurred on a weekend.
8.  **`.ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results based on the `week_start` date in ascending order.

This code provides the week start date, the total number of payments received that week (for sales > $30k), and the count of those payments that occurred on a weekend, for the last 8 full calendar weeks.","# Define the start of the current week for reference

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to find cars whose VIN contains 'M5' (case-insensitive), group them by make and model, and count the total sales for each group.
2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Cars`: Access the car data.
    *   `WHERE`: Filter cars based on the VIN condition.
    *   `LIKE` and `LOWER`: Perform a case-insensitive partial match on the `vin_number` field. `LOWER` converts the VIN to lowercase, and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards checks for the substring 'm5'.
    *   `PARTITION`: Group the filtered cars by their `make` and `model`.

    *   `COUNT`: Aggregate the number of sales records (`sale_records`) associated with the cars in each partition group.
3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: Partitioning by `make` and `model` is necessary to aggregate sales counts per unique make/model combination among the filtered cars.
4.  **Ranking Considerations**: Ranking is not needed for this query.

    *   `ORDER_BY(snapshot_date.DESC())`: To sort the inventory snapshots chronologically, latest first.
    *   `TOP_K(1)`: To select only the most recent inventory snapshot.
    *   `SINGULAR()`: To convert the single latest snapshot record into a singular context, allowing access to its `is_in_inventory` field.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter the sales records, keeping only those where the car's latest `is_in_inventory` status is `False`.
    *   `PARTITION`: To group the filtered sales records by the car's `make` and `model`.
    *   `MAX()`: An aggregation function needed within the `PARTITION`'s `CALCULATE` step to find the maximum `sale_price` for each make/model group.
    *   `ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`: To sort the final aggregated results.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   `PARTITION` is necessary here because we need to perform an aggregation (`MAX(sale_price)`) for each distinct group defined by `make` and `model`.
    *   We will partition the filtered sales data by the `car_make` and `car_model` fields calculated earlier.

4.  **Ranking Considerations:**
    *   While `RANKING` could be used on `inventory_snapshots`, using `ORDER_BY(snapshot_date.DESC()).TOP_K(1)` is a more direct way to get the single latest record for checking the `is_in_inventory` status.

5.  **Code Generation:**

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    *   `sales_with_status = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` from the related `car`, the `sale_price`, and determine the car's most recent inventory status. This involves accessing the car's `inventory_snapshots`, ordering them by `snapshot_date` descending, taking the top one (`TOP_K(1)`), treating it as a single record (`SINGULAR()`), and extracting its `is_in_inventory` value into `latest_inventory_status`.
    *   `sold_cars_not_in_stock = sales_with_status.WHERE(...)`: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only the records where `latest_inventory_status` is explicitly `False`, meaning the car was not in inventory according to its latest snapshot.
    *   `max_price_by_make_model = PARTITION(...)`: We partition the filtered sales records (`sold_cars_not_in_stock`) into groups based on the unique combinations of `car_make` and `car_model`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make=car_make, model=car_model, highest_sale_price=MAX(sales_group.car_sale_price))`: For each partition (group), we calculate the final output fields. `make` and `model` are taken directly from the partition keys. `highest_sale_price` is calculated by applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `car_sale_price` of all sales records within that specific `sales_group` (partition).
    *   `final_result = max_price_by_make_model.ORDER_BY(...)`: Finally, we sort the resulting aggregated records (one per make/model) in descending order based on the calculated `highest_sale_price`.","# Step 1: Access Sales and CALCULATE necessary info including latest inventory status for the car

    2.  `.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%') | LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`: Filters the cars. It converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase using `LOWER()` and then uses `LIKE` with the wildcard `%` to check if 'ford' is contained within the make or 'mustang' is contained within the model. The `|` (OR) operator combines these two conditions.

1.  **DATETIME('now', 'start of month')**: To determine the start of the current month, which is needed to define the 6-month lookback period accurately.
2.  **DATETIME(base_date, interval)**: To calculate the start date of the 6-month period (`-6 months` from the start of the current month).
3.  **WHERE**: To filter the `Sales` collection based on two criteria:
    *   The `sale_date` must fall within the last 6 full months (from 6 months before the start of the current month up to, but not including, the start of the current month).
    *   The `hire_date` of the associated `salesperson` must be in the years 2022 or 2023.
4.  **YEAR**: To extract the year from the `salesperson.hire_date`.
5.  **CALCULATE**: Used before partitioning to create the `sale_month` field (truncating `sale_date` to the start of the month) which will be used as the partitioning key. It also ensures `sale_price` is explicitly carried forward for aggregation.
6.  **PARTITION**: To group the filtered sales records by the calculated `sale_month`.
7.  **COUNT**: Used within the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` to count the number of sales within each monthly group (`PMSPS`).
8.  **SUM**: Used within the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` to sum the `sale_price` for all sales within each monthly group (`PMSR`).
9.  **ORDER_BY**: To sort the final results by month in ascending order.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is necessary here to group the sales data by month for aggregation. The `Sales` collection is filtered first based on the date range and salesperson criteria. Then, a `sale_month` field is calculated. Partitioning is done using this `sale_month` field (`by=sale_month`). This groups all relevant sales that occurred within the same calendar month together.

**Note on Zero-Value Months:**

This query will only return months within the specified 6-month period for which there was at least one sale meeting the criteria (correct date range and salesperson hired in 2022/2023). Months within the period that had zero relevant sales will not be included in the output due to how `PARTITION` works on existing data. If a complete list of all 6 months (including those with zero sales/revenue) is strictly required, further processing outside of this specific PyDough query might be needed, as PyDough doesn't inherently generate rows for non-existent group keys.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Define the date range boundaries
start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
# Start date is the beginning of the month, 6 months prior to the current month's start
start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-6 months')
# End date is the start of the current month (exclusive)
end_of_period = start_of_current_month

# Filter sales based on date range and salesperson hire year
relevant_sales = Sales.WHERE(
    (sale_date >= start_of_period) &
    (sale_date < end_of_period) &

    # PMSR: Sum of sale prices in the group
    PMSR = SUM(monthly_sales_group.sale_price)
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC()) # Order results chronologically
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**: `start_of_period` is calculated as the first day of the month that was 6 months before the current month started. `end_of_period` is the first day of the current month. The filter `sale_date >= start_of_period & sale_date < end_of_period` selects sales from the last 6 full calendar months.
2.  **Filtering Sales**: The `Sales` collection is filtered to include only sales that occurred within the defined date range AND were made by salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023 (inclusive).
3.  **Calculating Sale Month**: A `CALCULATE` step computes `sale_month` by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month. This prepares the data for monthly grouping. `sale_price` is also explicitly selected.
4.  **Partitioning**: `PARTITION` groups the `relevant_sales` data using the `sale_month` as the key. All sales from the same month (that met the filter criteria) are put into the same group, accessible via `monthly_sales_group`.
5.  **Aggregation**: Within the final `CALCULATE`, for each `sale_month` group:
    *   `month` is assigned the `sale_month` value (the grouping key).
    *   `PMSPS` is calculated by counting the records in the `monthly_sales_group`.
    *   `PMSR` is calculated by summing the `sale_price` of all records in the `monthly_sales_group`.
6.  **Ordering**: The final result set is ordered by `month` in ascending order.","# Define the date range boundaries

1.  `PaymentsReceived`: This collection contains the necessary data, specifically `payment_date` and `payment_amount`.
2.  `CALCULATE`: Initially used to extract the year and month from `payment_date` for each payment record. This prepares the data for monthly grouping. It's used again after partitioning to define the output fields.
3.  `YEAR()`, `MONTH()`: Date functions required to extract the year and month from `payment_date`.
4.  `PARTITION`: Essential for grouping the payments. We will group by the extracted year and month to aggregate payments monthly.
5.  `SUM()`: Aggregation function needed within the post-partition `CALCULATE` to sum `payment_amount` for each month.
6.  `ORDER_BY`: To present the results chronologically.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is required to group payments by month. The `PaymentsReceived` collection will be partitioned by the year and month extracted from `payment_date`.

**MoM Change and All Months Limitation:**

Calculating the Month-over-Month (MoM) change (`current month value - previous month value`) typically requires accessing the previous month's aggregated total. The provided PyDough reference does not include a standard `LAG()` function or a similar mechanism to easily access data from a preceding row within an aggregated and ordered result set.

Furthermore, generating rows for *all* months, including those with zero payments, usually requires a calendar table or date generation capabilities, which are not specified in the PyDough reference.

Due to these limitations based on the provided documentation, the following code calculates total payments only for months present in the `PaymentsReceived` data and cannot compute the MoM change or include months with zero payments.

**Generated PyDough Code:**

```python
# Calculate year and month for each payment received
payments_with_dates = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(
    pay_year=YEAR(payment_date),
    pay_month=MONTH(payment_date),
    amount=payment_amount
)

# Partition by year and month, then calculate the sum of payments for each group
monthly_payment_totals = PARTITION(
    payments_with_dates,
    name='monthly_group',
    by=(pay_year, pay_month)
).CALCULATE(
    year=pay_year,
    month=pay_month,
    total_monthly_payments=SUM(monthly_group.amount)
).ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = monthly_payment_totals
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `payments_with_dates = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`: This line processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, it extracts the `pay_year` and `pay_month` from the `payment_date` and selects the `payment_amount` (renamed to `amount` for clarity within the context).
2.  `monthly_payment_totals = PARTITION(...)`: This partitions the intermediate `payments_with_dates` collection. It groups the records based on unique combinations of `pay_year` and `pay_month`. The `name='monthly_group'` assigns a name to access the records within each partition.
3.  `.CALCULATE(year=pay_year, month=pay_month, total_monthly_payments=SUM(monthly_group.amount))`: This operates on each partition (each month). It selects the `pay_year` (as `year`) and `pay_month` (as `month`) which are the partitioning keys. It then calculates the `total_monthly_payments` by summing the `amount` of all records belonging to that specific month's group (`monthly_group`).
4.  `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`: This sorts the final results first by year in ascending order and then by month in ascending order.
5.  `result = monthly_payment_totals`: The final calculated monthly totals are assigned to the variable `result`.

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    1.  `start_of_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of day', '-6 days')`: This line defines the beginning of the 7-day window. It takes the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncates it to the beginning of the current day (`'start of day'`), and then subtracts 6 days (`'-6 days'`). This gives the date exactly 7 days ago relative to today (inclusive of today).

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 3 salespersons based on their Average Selling Price (ASP).
2.  **ASP Calculation:** ASP = Total Sales Amount / Number of Sales.
3.  **Data Needed:**
    *   Salesperson's first and last name (`Salespersons` collection).
    *   Each salesperson's total sales amount (`SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`).
    *   Each salesperson's total number of sales (`COUNT(sales_made)`).
4.  **Collections:** `Salespersons` and its sub-collection `sales_made` (linking to `Sales`).
5.  **PyDough Functions:**
    *   `Salespersons`: To access the primary collection.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To compute the total sales amount, number of sales, and ASP for each salesperson, and to select the final output fields.
    *   `SUM`: To aggregate the `sale_price` from the `sales_made` sub-collection.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of records in the `sales_made` sub-collection.
    *   `IFF`: To handle the case where a salesperson might have zero sales (to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP). We'll return 0 for ASP in such cases.
    *   `TOP_K`: To select the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated ASP.
    *   `DESC`: To specify descending order for ASP within `TOP_K`.

**Partitioning Strategy:**
`PARTITION` is not required. We can perform the calculations directly on the `Salespersons` collection using `CALCULATE` with aggregations on the `sales_made` sub-collection.

**Code Generation:**

```python
# Calculate total sales and number of sales for each salesperson

**Explanation:**

1.  `salesperson_stats = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `sp_first_name`: Renames `first_name`.
    *   `sp_last_name`: Renames `last_name`.
    *   `total_sales_amount`: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales linked to the salesperson via `sales_made`.
    *   `num_sales`: Counts the total number of sales linked to the salesperson via `sales_made`.
2.  `top_salespersons_by_asp = salesperson_stats.TOP_K(...)`: We take the results from the previous step (`salesperson_stats`) and apply `TOP_K`:
    *   `3`: We want the top 3 records.
    *   `by=IFF(num_sales > 0, total_sales_amount / num_sales, 0.0).DESC()`: This defines the sorting criteria. We calculate the ASP (`total_sales_amount / num_sales`) only if `num_sales` is greater than 0 (using `IFF` to return 0 otherwise, preventing division by zero). `.DESC()` ensures we sort from highest ASP to lowest.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Finally, for the top 3 salespersons selected by `TOP_K`, we select the desired output fields:
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`: Selects the first name.
    *   `last_name=sp_last_name`: Selects the last name.

1.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   We need to find the top 3 salespersons based on their total revenue (`sale_price`) from sales made in the last 3 months (including today).
    *   The output should include the salesperson's first name, last name, the total count of their sales in that period, and their total revenue in that period.
    *   We'll be using the `Dealership` database, specifically the `Salespersons` and `Sales` collections.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification:**
    *   `Salespersons`: The starting point to get salesperson details.
    *   `sales_made`: The sub-collection linking salespersons to their sales records.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter the `sales_made` records to include only those within the last 3 months.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`: To calculate the start date of our 3-month window. We need sales on or after this date.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To compute the total number of sales (`COUNT`) and total revenue (`SUM`) for each salesperson based on the filtered sales, and to select the required output fields (first name, last name).
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales records within the filtered timeframe for each salesperson.
    *   `SUM`: To sum the `sale_price` of the filtered sales records for each salesperson.
    *   `TOP_K`: To select the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated `total_revenue`.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   `PARTITION` is not necessary. We can perform the aggregations directly on the `Salespersons` collection level, aggregating data from the `sales_made` sub-collection after filtering.

4.  **Ranking Considerations:**
    *   `RANKING` is not needed; `TOP_K` directly gives us the top N results based on a specified metric.

5.  **Code Generation:**

```python

    *   `Salespersons`: To access the data for salespersons.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter only those salespersons who have a `termination_date` (i.e., they have been fired or left). The `PRESENT` function is used to check for non-null termination dates.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To compute the duration of employment in days using `DATEDIFF` between `hire_date` and `termination_date`. It's also used to combine `first_name` and `last_name` using `JOIN_STRINGS` and select the phone number.
    *   `DATEDIFF`: To calculate the difference between two dates (`termination_date` and `hire_date`) in days.
    *   `TOP_K`: To find the single salesperson (`k=1`) with the minimum employment duration. We sort by the calculated duration in ascending order (`ASC`).
    *   `JOIN_STRINGS`: To concatenate the first and last names into a full name.

*   **Partitioning Strategy**:
    *   `PARTITION` is not required for this query as we are looking for a single record based on a calculated value across the entire filtered collection, not performing aggregations within groups.

*   **Ranking Considerations**:
    *   `RANKING` is not needed. `TOP_K` is sufficient to find the salesperson with the minimum employment duration.

```python
# Filter salespersons who have a termination date and calculate their employment duration in days
shortest_employed_salesperson = Salespersons.WHERE(

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  The query starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    2.  It filters this collection using `WHERE(PRESENT(termination_date))` to include only salespersons whose employment has ended (i.e., `termination_date` is not null).
    3.  The first `CALCULATE` computes `employment_duration_days` by finding the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF`. It also creates `full_name` by joining `first_name` and `last_name`, and selects the `phone` number as `phone_num`.
    4.  `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())` selects the single salesperson with the smallest `employment_duration_days`.
    5.  The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the required fields: `full_name` as `salesperson_name`, `phone_num` as `salesperson_phone`, and `employment_duration_days` as `days_employed`.

2.  **Data Source**: `PaymentsReceived` collection.
3.  **Key Fields**: `payment_date`, `payment_amount`, `payment_method`.
4.  **Filtering**: We need payments where `payment_date` falls within the previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday).
    *   We can use `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` to find the start of the *current* ISO week (assuming Monday start).

    *   The filter condition will be `(payment_date >= start_prev_week) & (payment_date < start_current_week)`.
5.  **Grouping**: We need to group the results by the specific day (`payment_date` truncated to the day) and by `payment_method`. `PARTITION` is the correct function for this.
    *   We'll need to calculate the day from `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_prev_week` and `start_current_week` are defined using `DATETIME` to establish the date boundaries for the previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday). `start_current_week` acts as the exclusive end date.
2.  `PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)` filters the records to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated range of the previous week.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)` is used immediately after filtering to prepare the data for partitioning. It extracts the date part (`payment_day`) using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` and keeps `payment_method` and `payment_amount`.
4.  `PARTITION(...)` groups the resulting `payments_in_prev_week` collection. The grouping keys are `payment_day` and `payment_method`. The grouped data within each partition is accessible via the name `daily_method_group`.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` operates on each partition group. It selects the `payment_day` and `payment_method` (which are the partition keys) and calculates the `total_daily_amount` by summing the `payment_amount` for all records within that specific `daily_method_group`.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(...)` sorts the final results first by day and then by payment method for better readability.","# Define the start and end dates for the previous ISO week

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `sales_data_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
    2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered sale record:
        *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
        *   `sale_amount=sale_price`: Selects the sale price.
        *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: Calculates the first date of the quarter based on the `MONTH` of the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` conditions and the `DATETIME` function to determine the correct start date (Jan 1st, Apr 1st, Jul 1st, or Oct 1st) for the year 2023.
    3.  `quarterly_sales_by_state_2023 = PARTITION(...)`: Groups the `sales_data_2023` collection.
        *   `name='quarterly_group'`: Assigns a name to access data within each group.
        *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start_date)`: Specifies that grouping should be done based on the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (combination of state and quarter):
        *   `state=cust_state`: Selects the state for the group.
        *   `quarter=quarter_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(quarterly_group.sale_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_amount` for all sales within that specific state and quarter group.
    5.  `.ORDER_BY(state.ASC(), quarter.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by state alphabetically and then by quarter chronologically.","# Filter sales for 2023 and CALCULATE customer state and quarter start date

    *   `WHERE`: To filter `InventorySnapshots` to include only those from March 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023` and `MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) and those where the car is marked as in inventory (`is_in_inventory == True`). It's also used to filter snapshots matching the calculated latest date.
    *   `CALCULATE`: Used at the top level (`Dealership`) to determine the single latest `snapshot_date` within March 2023 using the `MAX` aggregation function. It's also used at the end on the `car` sub-collection to select and rename the required fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`).
    *   `MAX`: An aggregation function needed within the top-level `CALCULATE` to find the maximum (latest) `snapshot_date` among the filtered March 2023 snapshots.
    *   `YEAR`, `MONTH`: Datetime functions required to extract the year and month from the `snapshot_date` for filtering.
    *   `SINGULAR`: Needed to access the single `latest_march_date` value calculated at the `Dealership` graph level, making it available for the subsequent `WHERE` clause on `InventorySnapshots`.
*   **Partitioning Strategy**:
    *   `PARTITION` is not required here. The goal is to find a single global maximum date for March 2023 snapshots and then filter based on that date, rather than grouping by any specific key.
*   **Ranking Considerations**:
    *   `RANKING` is not the most direct approach here. While it could be used to rank snapshots by date, calculating the single latest date using `MAX` at the graph level and then filtering is simpler for this specific requirement.

# Calculate the latest snapshot date within March 2023
latest_date_calc = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    latest_march_date=MAX(
        InventorySnapshots.WHERE(
            (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) & (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3)

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `latest_date_calc = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the single latest `snapshot_date` that occurred within March 2023 across all inventory snapshots. It first filters `InventorySnapshots` for the year 2023 and month 3, then finds the `MAX` date within that subset.
    2.  `latest_inventory_in_march = Dealership.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `InventorySnapshots` collection. It keeps only the snapshots that occurred exactly on the `latest_march_date` (obtained using `SINGULAR()` from the previous step) AND where the `is_in_inventory` flag is `True`.
    3.  `cars_in_latest_inventory = latest_inventory_in_march.car.CALCULATE(...)`: For the snapshots identified in the previous step, this accesses the related `car` information via the `car` relationship and selects the `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`, renaming them for clarity in the final output.","# CALCULATE the latest snapshot date within March 2023
