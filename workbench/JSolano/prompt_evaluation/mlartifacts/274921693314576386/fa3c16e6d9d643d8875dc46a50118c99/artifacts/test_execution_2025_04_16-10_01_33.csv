    *   `WHERE`: To filter `Sales` by `sale_price > 30000` and later to filter payments based on the calculated date range.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To derive new fields for each payment: the start date of the week the payment occurred (`payment_week_start`), the day number within that week (`day_num_in_week`), and a flag indicating if it was a weekend (`is_weekend_payment`).
    *   `DATETIME`: To determine the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`), the start of the 8-week period prior (`DATETIME(..., '-56 days')`), and the start of the week for each `payment_date`.
    *   `DATEDIFF`: To calculate the number of days between the start of a payment's week and the payment date itself, necessary to identify the day of the week.
    *   `ISIN`: To check if the calculated day number corresponds to a Saturday (day 5) or Sunday (day 6), assuming the week starts on Monday (day 0).
    *   `PARTITION`: To group the filtered payments by the `payment_week_start` date, enabling aggregation per week.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the total number of payments within each weekly partition.
    *   `SUM`: To sum the `is_weekend_payment` flag within each weekly partition, effectively counting weekend payments.
    *   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final weekly results chronologically by `week_start_date`.

*   **Partitioning Strategy**:
    *   Partitioning by `payment_week_start` is essential because the request requires aggregating payment counts *for each* of the specified weeks. This grouping allows `COUNT` and `SUM` to operate on a per-week basis.

*   **Explanation**:
    1.  Define `current_week_start_date` as the Monday of the current week and `start_period_date` as the Monday 8 weeks prior.
    2.  Filter the `Sales` collection to keep only records where `sale_price` exceeds 30,000.
    3.  Access the `payment` sub-collection for these filtered sales.
    4.  For each payment, calculate `payment_week_start` (the Monday of the week the payment occurred), `day_num_in_week` (0 for Monday, 6 for Sunday), and `is_weekend_payment` (True if `day_num_in_week` is 5 or 6).
    5.  Filter these calculated payment records, keeping only those where `payment_week_start` falls within the 8-week window defined by `start_period_date` (inclusive) and `current_week_start_date` (exclusive).
    6.  Partition the filtered payments using `payment_week_start` as the key. This groups all payments from the same week together.
    7.  For each weekly partition (`payments_in_week`):
        *   Select the `payment_week_start` date as `week`.
        *   Calculate `total_payments_received` by counting all records in the partition.
        *   Calculate `weekend_payments_received` by summing the `is_weekend_payment` flag (True counts as 1, False as 0).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_30_days_ago = DATETIME('now', '-30 days', 'start of day')`**: This line defines a variable `start_date_30_days_ago`. It uses the `DATETIME` function to calculate the date and time exactly 30 days before the current moment (`'now'`) and then truncates it to the beginning of that day (`'start of day'`). This ensures we capture all sales from 30 days ago up to the current time.
2.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to select existing fields and compute a new one.
3.  **`salesperson_id=_id, sp_first_name=first_name, sp_last_name=last_name`**: These select the salesperson's ID, first name, and last name, renaming them for clarity in the output.
4.  **`num_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_30_days_ago))`**: This calculates the number of sales for each salesperson within the specified date range.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with each salesperson.
    *   `.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_30_days_ago)`: Filters these sales, keeping only those where the `sale_date` is on or after the calculated start date (within the last 30 days, inclusive).
    *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales records remaining after the filter for each salesperson. This count is assigned to the new field `num_sales`.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(num_sales.DESC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection of salespersons based on the `num_sales` field in descending order, placing the salesperson with the most sales at the top.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Cars`: To access car data.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter cars by `make == 'Toyota'` and sales by `sale_date`.
    *   `sale_records`: To access the sales associated with the filtered cars.
    *   `DATETIME`: To calculate the start date of the 30-day period (`DATETIME('now', '-29 days', 'start of day')`).
    *   `GRAPH.CALCULATE`: To perform the final aggregation (COUNT and SUM) across the filtered sales records and return a single result row.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales that meet the criteria.
    *   `SUM`: To calculate the total revenue from the `sale_price` of the qualifying sales.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not required because the aggregation (count and sum) is performed over the entire set of filtered sales records, not grouped by any specific attribute.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not needed for this query.

5.  **Handling Ambiguity**: The phrase ""last 30 days inclusive of today"" is interpreted as the period starting from 29 days before today's date up to and including today.

6.  **Code Generation**:

    ```

8.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   `start_period = DATETIME('now', '-29 days', 'start of day')`: This line defines a variable `start_period` representing the beginning of the day 29 days prior to the current date. This marks the start of our 30-day window.
    *   `toyota_sales_last_30_days = Dealership.Cars.WHERE(make == 'Toyota').sale_records.WHERE(sale_date >= start_period)`: This filters the `Cars` collection to select only those with `make` equal to 'Toyota'. Then, it accesses their associated `sale_records` and further filters these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is on or after the calculated `start_period`.
    *   `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs a calculation at the top level of the `Dealership` graph.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(toyota_sales_last_30_days)`: This counts the total number of sales records obtained from the previous filtering step.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(toyota_sales_last_30_days.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` for all the sales records identified in the filtering step.
    *   The final `result` variable holds a single record containing the `number_of_sales` and `total_revenue` for Toyota cars sold in the specified period.",,Unknown,

    *   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final result by the sales rank.

*   **Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   `PARTITION` is not required for this query. Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`) and ranking (`RANKING`) can be performed directly on the `Salespersons` collection using `CALCULATE`.

*   **Ranking Considerations:**
    *   `RANKING` will be applied globally across all salespersons based on their total sales amount in descending order. `levels` is not needed as the ranking is across the entire collection.

    num_sales=num_sales,
    SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())
).ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())

```

*   **Explanation:**
    1.  `salesperson_stats = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This first step accesses the `Salespersons` collection and calculates two new fields for each salesperson:
        *   `total_sales_amount`: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales linked to the salesperson via the `sales_made` sub-collection.
        *   `num_sales`: Counts the total number of sales records linked to the salesperson via `sales_made`.
        *   It also selects the `first_name` and `last_name`.
    2.  `salesperson_performance = salesperson_stats.CALCULATE(...)`: This second step takes the intermediate result (`salesperson_stats`) and calculates the sales rank:
        *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Assigns a rank (`SR`) to each salesperson based on their `total_sales_amount` calculated in the previous step. The highest sales amount gets rank 1.
        *   It then selects the final required fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, `num_sales`, and the calculated `SR`.

    *   `ORDER_BY`: Used twice: first to sort `inventory_snapshots` by `snapshot_date` to find the latest, and second to sort the final result by `highest_sale_price`.
    *   `TOP_K`: Used with `ORDER_BY` to select the single latest snapshot record (`k=1`).
    *   `SINGULAR`: To convert the single latest snapshot record (obtained via `TOP_K`) into a singular context, allowing direct access to its fields like `is_in_inventory`.
    *   `DEFAULT_TO`: To handle cases where a car might not have any inventory snapshots. We default `is_in_inventory` to `True` in such cases, ensuring these cars are filtered out by the subsequent `WHERE` clause.

    *   The partitioning keys are `make` and `model`, derived from the car associated with each sale.

*   **Ranking Considerations:**
    *   While `RANKING` isn't used directly, the combination `ORDER_BY(snapshot_date.DESC()).TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC()).SINGULAR()` effectively ranks snapshots by date and selects the top one (the latest) for each car.

```python
# Step 1: Identify cars that have been sold and whose latest inventory status is 'not in inventory'
cars_not_in_inventory = Cars.CALCULATE(
    # Keep make and model for grouping later
    car_make=make,

    highest_sale_price=MAX(sales_group.price) # Calculate the maximum sale price within the group
).ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC()) # Order the final result by the calculated highest price, descending
```

*   **Explanation:**
    1.  The code first identifies cars (`cars_not_in_inventory`) by:
        *   Finding the latest inventory snapshot for each car using `ORDER_BY` date descending and `TOP_K(1)`.
        *   Extracting the `is_in_inventory` status from this latest snapshot, defaulting to `True` if no snapshot exists.
        *   Checking if the car has any associated `sale_records`.
        *   Filtering to keep only cars where the latest status is `False` (not in inventory) and `has_sales` is `True`.
    2.  It then accesses the `sale_records` for these filtered cars (`sales_to_analyze`), calculating the `make`, `model` (from the parent car context), and the `sale_price` (renamed to `price`).
    3.  Finally, it uses `PARTITION` to group these sales records by `make` and `model`.
    4.  Within each partition (group), it calculates the `MAX` sale price, naming it `highest_sale_price`.
    5.  The result includes the `make`, `model`, and `highest_sale_price` for each group, ordered by `highest_sale_price` from highest to lowest.","# Step 1: Identify cars that have been sold and whose latest inventory status is 'not in inventory'

**1. Analyze the Input**

*   **Goal:** Calculate monthly sales count (PMSPS) and monthly sales revenue (PMSR) for a specific group of salespersons over a defined time period.
*   **Salesperson Filter:** Hired between Jan 1, 2022, and Dec 31, 2023 (inclusive).
*   **Time Period:** The last 6 full months, excluding the current month.
*   **Output:** Year, Month, PMSPS, PMSR for each month in the period, including months with zero values for the metrics. Ordered by month ascending.
*   **Database:** Dealership
*   **Collections:** `Sales`, `Salespersons`.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `DATETIME('now', ...)`: To dynamically calculate the start and end dates of the 6-month period relative to the current date. We need `'start of month'` to align with month boundaries and `'-6 months'` to define the lookback period.
*   `WHERE`: To filter `Sales` records to include only those within the calculated 6-month date range (`sale_date`).
*   `CALCULATE`: To extract `sale_year` and `sale_month` from `sale_date`, and crucially, to create intermediate conditional values (`is_relevant_sale_flag`, `relevant_sale_price_value`) needed for aggregation.
*   `YEAR`, `MONTH`: To extract date components for filtering (`YEAR(salesperson.hire_date)`) and partitioning (`YEAR(sale_date)`, `MONTH(sale_date)`).
*   `IFF`: To create a binary flag (`is_relevant_sale_flag`) that is 1 if the sale meets the salesperson criteria (hired 2022-2023) and 0 otherwise. This allows counting relevant sales using `SUM`.
*   `KEEP_IF`: To isolate the `sale_price` only for sales meeting the salesperson criteria, returning `null` otherwise. This ensures `SUM` only aggregates revenue from the target group.
*   `PARTITION`: To group the prepared sales data by `sale_year` and `sale_month`. This is essential for calculating the monthly aggregates (PMSPS, PMSR) and ensures that all months *with any sales* within the period are represented in the output structure.
*   `SUM`: To aggregate the `is_relevant_sale_flag` (giving the count of relevant sales, PMSPS) and `relevant_sale_price_value` (giving the total revenue from relevant sales, PMSR) within each monthly partition.
*   `DEFAULT_TO`: To ensure that `PMSR` shows `0.0` instead of `null` for months where sales occurred but none were by the relevant salespersons.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final monthly results chronologically (`year.ASC()`, `month.ASC()`).

**3. Partitioning Strategy**

Partitioning is necessary to group sales by month. We will partition the `Sales` data (after initial date filtering and calculation of helper fields) by `sale_year` and `sale_month`. This approach allows us to consider all months within the period that had *any* sales activity and then calculate the specific metrics for the target salesperson group within each month, defaulting to zero if they had no activity in a given month.

**4. Code Generation**

```python
# Define the date range: last 6 full months excluding the current month
# Start date is the first day of the month, 6 months ago
start_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')
# End date is the first day of the current month (the range is exclusive of this date)
end_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')

# Prepare sales data: Filter by date range and calculate helper fields
sales_data_prepared = Sales.WHERE(
    (sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date < end_period_date)
).CALCULATE(
    # Extract year and month from sale date for partitioning
    sale_year_val=YEAR(sale_date),
    sale_month_val=MONTH(sale_date),
    # Create a flag: 1 if salesperson was hired in 2022 or 2023, else 0
    is_relevant_sale_flag=IFF(
        (YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) >= 2022) & (YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) <= 2023),
        1,
        0
    ),
    # Get sale price only if salesperson is relevant, else null
    relevant_sale_price_value=KEEP_IF(
        sale_price,
        (YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) >= 2022) & (YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) <= 2023)
    )
)

    sales_data_prepared,
    name='monthly_sales_group',
    by=(sale_year_val, sale_month_val)

    # Output the year and month
    year=sale_year_val,
    month=sale_month_val,
    # Calculate PMSPS: Sum the flag (counts relevant sales)
    PMSPS=SUM(monthly_sales_group.is_relevant_sale_flag),
    # Calculate PMSR: Sum relevant prices, default to 0.0 if null (no relevant sales in the month)
    PMSR=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(monthly_sales_group.relevant_sale_price_value), 0.0)
# Order results chronologically
).ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())

# Assign the final result to a variable
salesperson_monthly_performance = monthly_metrics_calculation
```

**5. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **Define Date Range:** `start_period_date` and `end_period_date` are calculated using `DATETIME('now', ...)` to define the 6-month window ending just before the current month starts.
2.  **Prepare Sales Data:**
    *   The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the defined `start_period_date` (inclusive) and `end_period_date` (exclusive).
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Extract the `sale_year_val` and `sale_month_val` from the `sale_date`.
        *   Create `is_relevant_sale_flag`: This flag is set to `1` using `IFF` if the sale's associated `salesperson` was hired (`hire_date`) in 2022 or 2023, and `0` otherwise.
        *   Create `relevant_sale_price_value`: This uses `KEEP_IF` to retain the `sale_price` only if the salesperson meets the hiring criteria; otherwise, it becomes `null`.
3.  **Partition and Aggregate:**
    *   The prepared data (`sales_data_prepared`) is partitioned using `PARTITION` based on the `sale_year_val` and `sale_month_val`. This groups all sales from the period by month.
    *   Within each monthly partition (`monthly_sales_group`), `CALCULATE` is used again to compute the final metrics:
        *   `year` and `month` are selected directly from the partition keys.
        *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) is calculated by `SUM(monthly_sales_group.is_relevant_sale_flag)`. Since the flag is 1 for relevant sales and 0 otherwise, summing it counts the relevant sales in that month.
        *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated by `SUM(monthly_sales_group.relevant_sale_price_value)`. `SUM` ignores the `null` values (where the sale wasn't relevant), effectively summing only the revenue from the target group. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a month had sales, but none from the target group, PMSR is 0.0 instead of null.
4.  **Order Results:** The final monthly results are sorted chronologically using `ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`.
5.  **Assign Variable:** The complete query result is assigned to the variable `salesperson_monthly_performance`.

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only those records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.
    2.  `GRAPH.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the graph.
    3.  `total_revenue_val=SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales that occurred in 2023.
    4.  `total_cost_val=SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`: Calculates the sum of the `cost` for all cars associated with the sales that occurred in 2023. Accessing `car.cost` works because `car` is a singular relationship from a `Sales` record.
    5.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=(total_revenue_val - total_cost_val) / total_cost_val * 100.0)`: This takes the previously calculated `total_revenue_val` and `total_cost_val` and applies the GPM formula: `(revenue - cost) / cost * 100`. The result is assigned to the field `gpm_2023`. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage calculation.
    6.  The final result is stored in the `gpm_2023_result` variable, containing a single record with the calculated `gpm_2023`.","# Filter sales records for the year 2023

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to find the `make`, `model`, and `sale_price` of a specific car. The criteria for this car are:
    *   It must have the highest `sale_price` among a specific group of cars.
    *   This group consists of cars that were sold (`Sales` record exists) on the *exact same day* they were marked as out of inventory (`InventorySnapshots` record with `is_in_inventory == False`).

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Sales`: This is the primary collection to start with, as it contains `sale_price` and links to `Cars` and `sale_date`.
    *   `WHERE`: Needed twice. First, to filter the `InventorySnapshots` for the relevant date and status. Second, to filter the `Sales` based on whether a matching snapshot exists.
    *   `HAS`: To check if a car has a corresponding `InventorySnapshots` record meeting the criteria (`is_in_inventory == False` and `snapshot_date == sale_date`). We compare the result to `1` to ensure it evaluates to True.
    *   `car`: To navigate from a `Sales` record to its associated `Cars` record.
    *   `inventory_snapshots`: To access the inventory history linked to a `Cars` record.
    *   `TOP_K`: To select the single (`k=1`) sale record with the maximum `sale_price` after filtering. We need `.DESC()` to get the highest price.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To select and format the final output fields: `make`, `model` (from the associated car), and `sale_price`.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not required. We are looking for a single global maximum across all sales that meet the criteria, not grouping by any specific attribute.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not necessary. `TOP_K(1, by=...)` directly gives us the top record based on the specified criteria.

5.  **Code Generation**:

```python

# the car was marked as out of inventory.
sales_on_inventory_exit_day = Sales.WHERE(
    HAS(
        # Access the car associated with the sale, then its inventory snapshots

            # Filter snapshots: must be marked 'out of inventory' AND snapshot date must match the sale date
            (is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date)
        )
     # Ensure at least one such snapshot exists
    ) == 1

)
```

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   The code first filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause checks, for each sale, if there exists (`HAS(...) == 1`) an associated inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) for the *same car*.
    *   This snapshot must meet two conditions: `is_in_inventory` must be `False`, and the `snapshot_date` must equal the `sale_date` of the sale being considered.
    *   The result (`sales_on_inventory_exit_day`) contains only sales that happened on the day the car left inventory.
    *   Next, `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` is applied to this filtered set to find the single sale record with the highest `sale_price`.
    *   Finally, `CALCULATE` selects the `make` and `model` from the car associated with that top sale (`car.make`, `car.model`) and the `sale_price` from the sale record itself, renaming them for clarity.","# Filter sales records to find those WHERE the sale occurred on the same DAY

Additionally, it requires the calculation of the month-over-month (MoM) change for these totals. The result should include all months, even those without payments.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `CALCULATE`: To extract the year and month from the `payment_date` and select the `payment_amount`.
    *   `YEAR`, `MONTH`: Date functions needed to extract year and month components from `payment_date`.
    *   `PARTITION`: To group the `PaymentsReceived` data by the extracted `year` and `month`.
    *   `SUM`: An aggregation function required to calculate the total `payment_amount` for each month group created by `PARTITION`.
    *   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final results chronologically by year and then month.
    *   **MoM Calculation Limitation**: Calculating the MoM change (current month - previous month) typically requires accessing the previous row's value in an ordered dataset (like SQL's `LAG` function). Based on the provided PyDough reference, there isn't a direct equivalent window function or mechanism to easily access the previous row's aggregated value within the same query structure. Therefore, calculating the MoM change directly in this PyDough query is not feasible with the documented features.
    *   **Missing Months Limitation**: The `PARTITION` function groups existing data. It does not automatically generate rows for year/month combinations where no payments occurred. Fulfilling the requirement to ""Return all months... including those where there were no payments"" would necessitate a different approach, possibly involving a pre-defined calendar structure, which is beyond the standard operations described.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: Partitioning is necessary to group payments. We will partition the `PaymentsReceived` collection after adding `year` and `month` fields, using `(pay_year, pay_month)` as the partitioning keys.

4.  **Code Generation**: The code will focus on calculating the monthly totals, acknowledging the limitations for MoM change and including all months.

```python
# Step 1: Add year and month fields to the PaymentsReceived collection
payments_with_date_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(
    pay_year=YEAR(payment_date),
    pay_month=MONTH(payment_date),
    pay_amount=payment_amount

```

5.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` step processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection, extracting the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` and selecting the `payment_amount`. These new fields (`pay_year`, `pay_month`, `pay_amount`) are temporarily added to each payment record.
    *   The `PARTITION` function then groups these processed records based on the unique combinations of `pay_year` and `pay_month`. The `name='monthly_payments_group'` assigns a temporary name to access records within each group.
    *   Inside the second `CALCULATE` applied to the partitioned data, we select the `year` and `month` (which are the partitioning keys) and compute the `total_payments_received` for each group using `SUM(monthly_payments_group.pay_amount)`.
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY` sorts the resulting monthly totals chronologically, first by year and then by month.

    *   `GRAPH.CALCULATE`: To compute a single aggregated value (Total Sales Count) across the relevant data.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales records that meet the criteria.
    *   `Sales`: The collection containing the sales records.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter the sales records based on the sale date.
    *   `DATETIME`: To determine the date 7 days ago (inclusive of today, so it's today minus 6 days) to set the lower bound for the filter.

*   **Partitioning Strategy**:
    *   `PARTITION` is not required because the goal is to calculate a single aggregate count over a filtered subset of the `Sales` collection, not to group sales by any specific key.

*   **Ranking Considerations**:
    *   `RANKING` is not needed for this query as we are only counting records within a specific time frame.

*   **PyDough Code**:

        tsc_past_7_days=COUNT(Sales.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_limit))
    )
    ```

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `start_date_limit = DATETIME('now', 'start of day', '-6 days')`: This line defines a variable `start_date_limit`. It uses the `DATETIME` function to get the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncates it to the beginning of the current day (`'start of day'`), and then subtracts 6 days (`'-6 days'`). This effectively sets the earliest date for sales to be included (7 days ago, including today).
    2.  `total_sales_count_last_7_days = GRAPH.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the graph to produce a single result row.
    3.  `tsc_past_7_days=COUNT(Sales.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_limit))`: Inside `CALCULATE`, a field named `tsc_past_7_days` is created.
        *   `Sales.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_limit)`: This filters the `Sales` collection, keeping only the records where the `sale_date` is on or after the calculated `start_date_limit`.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the number of sales records remaining after the filter is applied. The result is assigned to `tsc_past_7_days`.
    4.  The final result stored in `total_sales_count_last_7_days` is a collection with a single row and a single column `tsc_past_7_days` containing the total count of sales in the specified period.",,Unknown,

The output should include the salesperson's first name, last name, and their calculated ASP. We'll use the `Dealership` database.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification:**
    *   `Salespersons`: This is the primary collection containing salesperson information.
    *   `CALCULATE`: We need this function multiple times:
        *   First, to calculate intermediate values for each salesperson: the total sum of their sales (`SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`) and the count of their sales (`COUNT(sales_made)`).
        *   Second, to calculate the ASP (`total_sales_amount / num_sales`). We need a separate `CALCULATE` because the intermediate fields (`total_sales_amount`, `num_sales`) are needed for the ASP calculation.
        *   Third, to select the final required fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `ASP`).
    *   `SUM`: To aggregate the `sale_price` from the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.

*   **Explanation:**
    1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    2.  Use `.WHERE()` to filter these salespersons.

        *   Filter these `payment` records using an inner `.WHERE()` to keep only those where `payment_method == 'Cash'`.
    4.  The `HAS()` function returns true (1) if the filtered sub-collection (cash payments for any sale made by the salesperson) is not empty. The outer `WHERE` condition `HAS(...) == 1` keeps only those salespersons for whom `HAS` returned true.

    *   `TOP_K`: Select the top 2 states based on the customer count.

*   **Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   Partitioning is necessary to group customers by state.
    *   The partition key will be the `state` field from the `Customers` collection.

*   **Code Generation:**

```python
# Partition customers by state and count the number of signups in each state
state_signups = PARTITION(Customers, name='cust_group', by=state).CALCULATE(
    state_name=state,
    total_signups=COUNT(cust_group)
)

# Select the top 2 states with the most signups
top_2_states_signups = state_signups.TOP_K(2, by=total_signups.DESC())

```

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    1.  `PARTITION(Customers, name='cust_group', by=state)`: Groups the `Customers` collection by the `state` field. Each group is accessible via the name `cust_group`.
    2.  `.CALCULATE(state_name=state, total_signups=COUNT(cust_group))`: For each state partition, calculates two fields:
        *   `state_name`: The name of the state (taken directly from the partition key `state`).
        *   `total_signups`: The total number of customers in that state group, calculated using `COUNT(cust_group)`.
    3.  `.TOP_K(2, by=total_signups.DESC())`: Selects the top 2 rows from the result of the `PARTITION` and `CALCULATE` operations, ordered by `total_signups` in descending order.
    4.  The final result is assigned to the variable `top_2_states_signups`, containing the state name and total signups for the top 2 states.","# PARTITION customers by state and count the number of signups in each state

1.  **Analyze the Input:**
    *   We need to find the top 3 salespersons based on their total revenue (`sale_price`) from sales made in the last 3 months (inclusive of today).
    *   The output should include the salesperson's first name, last name, the total count of their sales in that period, and their total revenue in that period.
    *   We'll use the `Dealership` database.

    *   `Salespersons`: The base collection containing salesperson information.
    *   `sales_made`: The sub-collection linking salespersons to their sales records.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter the `sales_made` records to include only those within the last 3 months.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`: To calculate the start date of our 3-month window. We need sales on or after this date.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales records for each salesperson within the filtered timeframe.
    *   `SUM`: To sum the `sale_price` for each salesperson's sales within the filtered timeframe.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To compute the `total_sales_count` and `total_revenue` for each salesperson and to select the required output fields (`first_name`, `last_name`).
    *   `TOP_K`: To select the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated `total_revenue`.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy:**
    *   `PARTITION` is not necessary. We can perform the aggregations directly on the `Salespersons` collection level, aggregating data from the `sales_made` sub-collection.

4.  **Ranking Considerations:**
    *   `RANKING` is not needed. `TOP_K` directly gives us the top N results based on a specified metric.

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    2.  Filter the collection using `WHERE` to include only salespersons for whom the `termination_date` is present (not null), meaning they are no longer employed.
    3.  Use `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Compute `employment_duration_days` by finding the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF`.

        *   Select the `phone` number and assign it to `phone_num`.
    4.  Apply `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())` to the result. This sorts the filtered and calculated salespersons by their employment duration in ascending order (`ASC`) and selects the top 1 record, which corresponds to the salesperson with the shortest employment time.
    5.  Use a final `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: `full_name` as `salesperson_name`, `phone_num` as `salesperson_phone`, and `employment_duration_days` as `days_employed`.

1.  **Analyze the Input**: The goal is to count payments made to a specific vendor ('Utility Company') specifically on weekends (Saturday or Sunday).
2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Dealership.PaymentsMade`: We need to access the collection containing payment records.
    *   `.WHERE()`: This function is required to filter the payments based on two criteria: the vendor name and the day of the week the payment was made.
    *   `vendor_name == 'Utility Company'`: This condition filters for the specific vendor.
    *   **Weekend Check**: The provided PyDough reference lacks a function like `DAYOFWEEK` to directly determine if a `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, filtering specifically for weekends is **not possible** with the documented functions. We can only filter by vendor.
    *   `COUNT()`: After filtering (only by vendor in this case), we need to count the number of resulting records.
    *   `Dealership.CALCULATE()`: To return the final count as a single value.
3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not needed as we are performing a simple count on a filtered collection, not grouping by any key.
4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not required for this counting task.
5.  **Handling Ambiguity**: The main issue is the lack of a weekend-checking function. The query will be adapted to count all payments for the vendor, acknowledging the limitation.
6.  **Code Generation**:

```python
# Filter payments made to 'Utility Company'.
# Note: Filtering by weekend (Saturday/Sunday) is not possible with the documented PyDough functions
# as there is no function to extract the day of the week from 'payment_date'.
# This query counts *all* payments made to 'Utility Company', regardless of the day.

7.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   The query starts at the top level of the `Dealership` graph.
    *   `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)` is used to compute a single result value.
    *   Inside `CALCULATE`, `COUNT(PaymentsMade.WHERE(vendor_name == 'Utility Company'))` performs the core logic:
        *   It accesses the `PaymentsMade` collection.
        *   It applies a `.WHERE()` filter to keep only records where the `vendor_name` is exactly 'Utility Company'.
        *   `COUNT()` then counts the number of records remaining after the filter.
    *   The final result is assigned to the field `num_payments_to_utility_company`.

**1. Analyze the Input**

*   **Goal**: Calculate the sum of `payment_amount` for each day within the *previous* ISO week.
*   **Source Data**: `PaymentsReceived` collection.
*   **Grouping**: The results need to be grouped by the day of the `payment_date` and the `payment_method`.
*   **Filtering**: Only include payments where `payment_date` falls within the previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday). The current week should be excluded.
*   **Output**: For each day and payment method combination in the previous week, show the date, the payment method, and the total payment amount.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   **`DATETIME`**: Needed to:
    *   Get the current date/time (`'now'`).
    *   Determine the start of the current ISO week (`'start of week'`). We assume this aligns with ISO standards (Monday).
    *   Calculate the start and end dates of the *previous* ISO week by subtracting days from the start of the current week.
    *   Truncate the `payment_date` to its day component (`'start of day'`) for daily grouping.
*   **`WHERE`**: Required to filter `PaymentsReceived` records to include only those whose `payment_date` falls between the calculated start and end dates of the previous ISO week.
*   **`CALCULATE`**: Used *before* partitioning to create the `payment_day` field needed for grouping. Also used *after* partitioning to select the final output fields and perform the aggregation.
*   **`PARTITION`**: Necessary to group the filtered payments by the calculated `payment_day` and the `payment_method`.
*   **`SUM`**: Required within the final `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` to sum the `payment_amount` for each group (day + payment method).
*   **`ORDER_BY`** (Optional but recommended): To present the results in a logical order, typically by date and then payment method.

**3. Partitioning Strategy**

*   Partitioning is required because we need to aggregate (`SUM`) amounts based on distinct combinations of day and payment method.
*   We will partition by two keys:
    1.  The day extracted from `payment_date` (calculated as `payment_day`).
    2.  The `payment_method`.
*   This ensures that `SUM(payment_amount)` operates correctly within each unique day/method group.

**4. Ranking Considerations**

*   `RANKING` is not needed for this request.

**5. Handling Ambiguity**

*   The main assumption is that `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` correctly identifies the start of the ISO week (Monday). If the system's definition of 'start of week' is different (e.g., Sunday), the date calculations would need adjustment. We proceed assuming it means Monday.

**6. Code Generation**

```python
# Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week

# Assign the final result to a variable
previous_week_daily_payments = daily_totals_by_method
```

**7. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **Date Calculation**: We first determine the start date (`start_of_previous_iso_week`) and end date (`end_of_previous_iso_week`) of the full ISO week immediately preceding the current one. This uses `DATETIME` with `'now'`, `'start of week'`, and date subtractions.
2.  **Filtering**: The `PaymentsReceived` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to keep only records whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated `start_of_previous_iso_week` and `end_of_previous_iso_week`.
3.  **Pre-Calculation**: Before partitioning, `CALCULATE` is used on the filtered data to:
    *   Create a `payment_day` field by truncating `payment_date` to the start of the day using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This is essential for daily grouping.
    *   Select the `payment_method` (aliased as `pay_method`) and `payment_amount` (aliased as `pay_amount`) needed for the next steps.
4.  **Partitioning**: The `PARTITION` function groups the intermediate results (`payments_in_prev_week`) based on the unique combinations of `payment_day` and `pay_method`. Each group is accessible via the name `payments_group`.
5.  **Aggregation & Output**: The final `CALCULATE` operates on the partitioned data. For each group:
    *   It outputs the `payment_day` (renamed `payment_date_day`) and `pay_method` (renamed `payment_method_type`) which were the partitioning keys.
    *   It calculates the `SUM` of `pay_amount` for all records within that specific `payments_group`, naming the result `total_daily_amount`.
6.  **Ordering**: `ORDER_BY` sorts the final results first by date (`payment_date_day`) and then by payment method (`payment_method_type`) for better readability.
7.  **Assignment**: The final computed collection is assigned to the variable `previous_week_daily_payments`.","# Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week

1.  **Goal**: Calculate total quarterly sales for 2023, grouped by customer state.
2.  **Data Needed**: Sales data (`Sales` collection), specifically `sale_date`, `sale_price`, and the associated customer's state (`customer.state`).
3.  **Filtering**: We only need sales from the year 2023.
4.  **Calculations**:
    *   Determine the quarter for each sale based on `sale_date`.
    *   Represent each quarter by its start date (e.g., Q1 -> YYYY-01-01, Q2 -> YYYY-04-01, etc.). We can use the `DATETIME` function combined with `IFF` and `MONTH` to achieve this.
    *   Extract the customer's state using `customer.state`.
5.  **Grouping**: We need to group the results by the calculated quarter start date and the customer's state. The `PARTITION` function is suitable for this.
6.  **Aggregation**: For each group (state and quarter), we need to sum the `sale_price`. The `SUM` aggregation function will be used within the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`.

**Function Selection:**

*   `Sales`: To access sales records.
*   `.WHERE()`: To filter sales records for the year 2023 using `YEAR(sale_date)`.
*   `.CALCULATE()`: To extract the customer state (`customer.state`), sale price (`sale_price`), and calculate the start date of the quarter (`quarter_start_date`) for each sale.
    *   `YEAR()`: To extract the year from `sale_date`.
    *   `MONTH()`: To extract the month from `sale_date`.
    *   `DATETIME()`: To manipulate dates, specifically to find the start of the year and add months to get the quarter start date.
    *   `IFF()`: To implement the conditional logic for determining the quarter start date based on the month.
*   `PARTITION()`: To group the intermediate results by customer state and the calculated quarter start date.
*   `SUM()`: To aggregate the `sale_price` within each partition group in the final `CALCULATE`.
*   `.ORDER_BY()`: (Optional but good practice) To sort the final results, for example, by state and then by quarter.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_quarter = Sales.WHERE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection and filter records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered sale, we calculate:
    *   `cust_state`: The state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `price`: The `sale_price` of the transaction.
    *   `month_num`: The month number (1-12) of the `sale_date`.
    *   `year_start`: The first day of the year 2023, derived from the `sale_date`.
    *   `q_start_date`: The start date of the quarter. This is calculated using nested `IFF` conditions based on `month_num`. It returns the `year_start` for Q1, `year_start` plus 3 months for Q2, plus 6 months for Q3, and plus 9 months for Q4.
3.  `quarterly_sales_by_state = PARTITION(...)`: We partition the intermediate `sales_with_quarter` collection.
    *   `name='quarterly_group'`: Names the grouped data within each partition.
    *   `by=(cust_state, q_start_date)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each partition (unique combination of state and quarter start date):
    *   `state=cust_state`: Selects the state (partition key).
    *   `quarter_start=q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date (partition key).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(quarterly_group.price)`: Calculates the sum of `price` for all sales records belonging to that specific state and quarter, accessing the grouped prices via `quarterly_group.price`.
5.  `.ORDER_BY(state.ASC(), quarter_start.ASC())`: Sorts the final result first by state alphabetically and then by the quarter start date chronologically.","# CALCULATE intermediate values: customer state, sale price, and quarter start date for 2023 sales

    *   `WHERE`: To filter `InventorySnapshots` based on the month and year of `snapshot_date`, the calculated latest date, and the `is_in_inventory` status.
    *   `MONTH`, `YEAR`: To extract the month and year from the `snapshot_date` for filtering.
    *   `MAX`: To determine the latest `snapshot_date` among all snapshots taken in March 2023.
    *   `CALCULATE`: Used at the `Dealership` graph level to compute the overall latest snapshot date for March 2023. Also used at the end to select the required fields from the `Cars` collection.
    *   `.car`: To navigate from the filtered `InventorySnapshots` records to their corresponding `Cars` records.

*   **Partitioning Strategy:** `PARTITION` is not required because the query involves filtering based on a calculated maximum date for a specific period (March 2023) and a boolean flag, rather than grouping data by specific keys.

*   **Ranking Considerations:** `RANKING` is not the most suitable approach here. While it could find the latest snapshot per car, the requirement is to find cars present in the *single latest snapshot* taken during March 2023 overall. Calculating the maximum date directly is more appropriate.

```python
# Calculate the latest snapshot date specifically for March 2023
latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    latest_date_in_march_2023=MAX(
        InventorySnapshots.WHERE(
            (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3) & (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)

)
```

*   **Explanation:**
    1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the maximum `snapshot_date` found within the `InventorySnapshots` collection, but only considering snapshots where the month is March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) and the year is 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). This maximum date is stored in the variable `latest_date_in_march_2023`.
    2.  `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We start from the `InventorySnapshots` collection, inheriting the calculated `latest_date_in_march_2023`.
    3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the snapshots based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   `snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023`: It keeps only the snapshots taken exactly on the latest date found in step 1.
        *   `is_in_inventory == True`: It further filters these snapshots to include only those where the `is_in_inventory` flag is explicitly True.
    4.  `.car`: For the filtered snapshots, it navigates to the associated `Cars` records.
    5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Finally, for these specific cars, it selects and renames the required fields: `_id` as `car_id`, `make` as `car_make`, `model` as `car_model`, and `year` as `car_year`.","# CALCULATE the latest snapshot date specifically for March 2023
