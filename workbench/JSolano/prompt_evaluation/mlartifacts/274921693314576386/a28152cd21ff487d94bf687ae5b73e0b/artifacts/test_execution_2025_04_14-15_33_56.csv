Here's my plan to convert the natural language description into PyDough code.

1.  **Collections Needed**: I need to start with the `Sales` collection and `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  **Filtering**: Filter `Sales` for `sale_price > 30000`.
3.  **Time Window**: Calculate the last 8 calendar weeks (excluding the current week). I'll need to use `DATEDIFF` to calculate the week number and filter based on that.
4.  **Weekend Check**: Determine if a payment was received on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). I'll need to use `DAY` to extract the day of the week from `payment_date`.
5.  **Aggregation**: Calculate the total payments and weekend payments for each week. I'll use `PARTITION` to group by week and then use `SUM` to aggregate the payment amounts.
6.  **Ordering**: Order the results by week in ascending order.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
import datetime

# Calculate the date 8 weeks ago from today
today = datetime.date.today()
eight_weeks_ago = today - datetime.timedelta(weeks=8)

# Calculate the date one week ago from today
one_week_ago = today - datetime.timedelta(weeks=1)

# Filter sales with sale price over $30,000
high_value_sales = Dealership.Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)

# Join sales with payments received and filter by date range
sales_with_payments = high_value_sales.payment.WHERE(
    (payment_date >= eight_weeks_ago) & (payment_date <= one_week_ago)
).CALCULATE(
    week_start=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of d') - datetime.timedelta(days=DAY(DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of d')) % 7),
    is_weekend=ISIN(DAY(payment_date), (6, 7)),
    payment_amount=payment_amount
)

# Partition by week and calculate total payments and weekend payments
weekly_payments = PARTITION(sales_with_payments, name=""weekly"", by=week_start).CALCULATE(
    week=week_start,
    total_payments=SUM(weekly.payment_amount),
    weekend_payments=SUM(KEEP_IF(weekly.payment_amount, weekly.is_weekend == 1))
).ORDER_BY(week.ASC())

results = weekly_payments
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Date Range**: The code first calculates the start date of the time window (8 weeks ago) and the end date of the time window (1 week ago).
2.  **Filter High-Value Sales**: It filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales with a `sale_price` greater than $30,000.
3.  **Join Sales with Payments and Filter by Date**: It accesses the `payment` sub-collection of the filtered `Sales` collection, filters the payments to include only those within the calculated date range (last 8 weeks excluding the current week), and calculates `week_start` to represent the start date of the week, `is_weekend` to flag weekend payments, and `payment_amount`.
4.  **Partition by Week**: It partitions the filtered payments by `week_start` and calculates the `total_payments` and `weekend_payments` for each week. `KEEP_IF` is used to only sum the payment amount if the payment occurred on a weekend.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, it orders the results by `week` in ascending order.
6.  **Assign to results**: Assigns the final query to a variable called `results`.

**1. Analyze the Input**

The request is to retrieve information about salespersons, including their name, total sales, number of sales, and their sales rank. The sales rank needs to be calculated based on the total sales amount in descending order.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `CALCULATE`: To derive new fields like `total_sales_amount` and to select the required fields.
*   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales for each salesperson.
*   `SUM`: To calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson.
*   `RANKING`: To determine the sales rank of each salesperson based on their total sales amount.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final result by sales rank.

**3. Code Generation**

```python
salesperson_info = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

)
```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation on the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  `first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons.
3.  `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` sub-collection.
4.  `number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales made by each salesperson using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `sales_made` sub-collection.
5.  `SR=RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson based on their total sales amount. The `RANKING` function orders the salespersons by the sum of `sale_price` in descending order (`DESC`).

We need to find the highest sale price for each car make and model, but only for cars that are *not* currently in inventory. We need to use the `InventorySnapshots` collection to determine the current inventory status of each car. We'll need to consider the most recent snapshot date for each car. Finally, we need to order the results by the highest sale price in descending order.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Find the latest snapshot date for each car:** We'll use `PARTITION` on `InventorySnapshots` by `car_id` to find the maximum `snapshot_date`.
2.  **Filter inventory snapshots:** We'll filter the `InventorySnapshots` to only include the latest snapshot for each car.
3.  **Identify cars not in inventory:** We'll filter the snapshots to find cars where `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
4.  **Join with Sales data:** We'll join the filtered inventory data with the `Sales` collection using `car_id`.
5.  **Calculate the highest sale price for each make and model:** We'll use `PARTITION` on the joined data by `car.make` and `car.model` to find the maximum `sale_price`.
6.  **Order the results:** We'll order the results by the maximum `sale_price` in descending order.

Here's the PyDough code:

2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"") | LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)`: Converts the `make` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` field contains ""ford"" as a substring. The `%` symbols are wildcards, meaning any characters can appear before or after ""ford"".
    *   `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `model` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` field contains ""mustang"" as a substring.
    *   `|`: The `|` symbol represents the logical OR operator. So, the `WHERE` clause selects cars where either the `make` contains ""ford"" or the `model` contains ""mustang"".
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates and selects the desired fields for the filtered cars.
    *   `make=make`: Selects the `make` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Date Range:**
    *   Calculates the date 6 months ago from the current month.
    *   Creates a list of tuples with year and month for each of the last 6 months.

2.  **Filter Salespersons:**
    *   Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive).

3.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics:**
    *   Iterates through each month in the `months` list.
    *   For each month, filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in that month.
    *   Calculates `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) and `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) for each salesperson in the filtered_salespersons collection.
        *   `COUNT(sales_this_month.WHERE(sales_this_month.salesperson_id == _id))` counts the number of sales made by each salesperson in the current month.
        *   `SUM(sales_this_month.WHERE(sales_this_month.salesperson_id == _id).sale_price)` calculates the total sales revenue for each salesperson in the current month.
    *   Extends the `monthly_metrics` list with the calculated metrics for the current month.

4.  **Order Results:**
    *   Orders the `monthly_metrics` collection by year and month in ascending order.

5.  **Final Result:**
    *   Assigns the ordered metrics to the `result` variable.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Payments:**
   - The code starts by calculating the `month`, `year`, and `payment_amount` from the `PaymentsReceived` collection. This creates a new collection called `monthly_payments` with these calculated fields.

2. **Partition by Year and Month:**
   - The `monthly_payments` collection is then partitioned by `year` and `month` using the `PARTITION` function. This groups the payments by year and month, creating a partition named ""monthly"".
   - Inside the `CALCULATE` function of the partition, the `SUM` function is used to calculate the `total_payments` for each month.

3. **Order by Year and Month:**
   - The `partitioned_payments` collection is ordered by `year` and `month` in ascending order using the `ORDER_BY` function. This ensures that the months are in chronological order for the MoM calculation.

4. **Calculate MoM Change:**
   - Finally, the `mom_change` collection is created by calculating the MoM change for each month.
   - The `RELSUM` function is used to calculate the sum of the `total_payments` for the previous month. The `levels=1` argument specifies that the sum should be calculated within each year.
   - The MoM change is then calculated by subtracting the previous month's total payments from the current month's total payments.

*   **`first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name, phone=phone`**: Selects the first name, last name, and phone number of the salesperson.
*   **`termination_date = DEFAULT_TO(termination_date, datetime.now())`**: If a salesperson has a `termination_date`, it uses that date. If `termination_date` is missing (null), it defaults to the current date (`datetime.now()`). This ensures that currently employed salespersons are also considered in the duration calculation.
*   **`employment_duration=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`**: Calculates the difference in days between the `hire_date` and the (potentially defaulted) `termination_date`. This gives us the employment duration.
*   **`.ORDER_BY(employment_duration.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration.ASC())`**: Orders the salespersons by `employment_duration` in ascending order and selects the top 1, effectively finding the salesperson with the shortest employment duration.

Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company',"SELECT COUNT(*) AS weekend_payments FROM payments_made WHERE vendor_name = 'Utility Company' AND strftime('%w', payment_date) IN ('0', '6');",Dealership,"Here's how we can approach this problem:

1.  **Identify the Collection**: We need to start with the `PaymentsMade` collection since we are interested in payments.
2.  **Filter for the Vendor**: We need to filter the `PaymentsMade` collection to only include payments made to 'Utility Company'.
3.  **Filter for Weekends**: We need to filter the payments to include only those made on weekends. We can use the `DAY` function to extract the day of the week (Sunday=0, Saturday=6) and check if it's a weekend.
4.  **Count the Payments**: Finally, we need to count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.

```python
payments_made_on_weekends = PaymentsMade.WHERE(

    (DAY(payment_date) == 0) | (DAY(payment_date) == 6)
)
num_payments = COUNT(payments_made_on_weekends)
```

**Explanation:**

*   The code first filters the `PaymentsMade` collection using the `WHERE` function.
*   The filter condition checks if the `vendor_name` is equal to 'Utility Company' AND if the day of the week of the `payment_date` is either 0 (Sunday) or 6 (Saturday).
*   The result of the filtering is assigned to the variable `payments_made_on_weekends`.
*   Finally, the `COUNT` function counts the number of records in the filtered collection, giving us the number of payments made on weekends to 'Utility Company'.

1.  **Determine the Previous ISO Week:** We need to calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week. Since PyDough doesn't have built-in ISO week functions, we'll need to use date calculations to achieve this.

2.  **Filter Payments:** Filter the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments within the calculated date range.

3.  **Partition by Payment Method:** Group the filtered payments by `payment_method`.

4.  **Calculate Total Amount:** Calculate the sum of `payment_amount` for each payment method within the previous ISO week.

5.  **Final Result:** Present the payment method and the corresponding total payment amount.

```python
import datetime

# Calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week
today = datetime.date.today()
current_iso_calendar_week = today.isocalendar()[1]
current_year = today.year

# Calculate the start date of the previous ISO week

start_date_previous_week = start_date_current_week - datetime.timedelta(days=7)

# Calculate the end date of the previous ISO week
end_date_previous_week = start_date_previous_week + datetime.timedelta(days=6)

    payment_method=Ewallet.PaymentsReceived.payment_method,
    total_amount=SUM(Ewallet.PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Calculation:** The code first calculates the start and end dates of the previous ISO week using Python's `datetime` module. It gets the current ISO week number and year, calculates the start date of the current week, and then subtracts 7 days to get the start date of the previous week. The end date is then calculated by adding 6 days to the start date of the previous week.

2.  **Filtering:** The `WHERE` clause filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments made within the calculated date range of the previous ISO week.

3.  **Partitioning:** The `PARTITION` function groups the filtered payments by `payment_method`. The name 'payments' is assigned to the partitioned data.

4.  **Calculation:** The `CALCULATE` function calculates the `total_amount` for each `payment_method` by summing the `payment_amount` within each partition.

5.  **Result:** The `payment_summary` variable now holds a collection containing the `payment_method` and the corresponding `total_amount` for the previous ISO week.

The quarters will be represented by the first date of each quarter.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales records from the year 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** Calculate the quarter start date (first day of the quarter) and extract the customer's state.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** Partition the data by customer's state and the quarter start date.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** Calculate the sum of `sale_price` for each state and quarter.
5.  **Present the Results:** Display the state, quarter start date, and total sales for that quarter.

```python
quarterly_sales = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(
    customer_state=customer.state,
    quarter_start=DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month'),
).CALCULATE(
    quarter_start=DATETIME(quarter_start, '- (MONTH(quarter_start) - 1) months', 'start of month')

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** The `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters the sales data to include only transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** The `.CALCULATE(...)` block calculates the `customer_state` and `quarter_start`. The `quarter_start` is calculated by first truncating the `sale_date` to the start of the month, and then subtracting the number of months to get to the start of the quarter.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** The `PARTITION` function groups the sales data by `customer_state` and `quarter_start`.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** The `.CALCULATE(...)` following the `PARTITION` calculates the `total_sales` for each group (state and quarter) by summing the `sale_price`.
5.  **Present the Results:** The final result `quarterly_sales_by_state` contains the `state`, `quarter`, and `total_sales` for each customer state and quarter in 2023.
