**1. Analyze the Input**
The request asks for a weekly summary of payments received for high-value sales (>$30,000). Specifically, for each of the last 8 full calendar weeks (not including the current week), we need the total count of payments and the count of payments received on weekends (Saturday or Sunday). The results should be ordered by week, ascending.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**
*   **`.WHERE()`**: Needed multiple times:
    *   To filter `Sales` based on `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   To filter `PaymentsReceived` based on the `payment_date` falling within the last 8 weeks (excluding the current week).
    *   To count weekend payments within the final aggregation (`COUNT(week_group.WHERE(is_weekend == True))`).
*   **`DATETIME()`**: Needed to:
    *   Determine the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`).
    *   Calculate the start date of the 8-week analysis window (`DATETIME(current_week_start, '-8 weeks')`).
    *   Calculate the start date of the week for each payment (`DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`) to use for grouping.
*   **`DATEDIFF()`**: Needed to determine the day of the week for the `payment_date`. We can calculate the number of days between a known Sunday (e.g., 1995-01-01) and the `payment_date`. The result modulo 7 tells us the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday).
*   **`ISIN()`**: Used with `DATEDIFF()` to check if the calculated day number corresponds to a weekend day (0 or 6).
*   **`.CALCULATE()`**: Needed to:
    *   Compute the `week_start` date and the `is_weekend` flag for each relevant payment *before* partitioning.
    *   Compute the final aggregated counts (`total_payments_received`, `weekend_payments_received`) after partitioning.
*   **`PARTITION()`**: Required to group the payments by the calculated `week_start` date.
*   **`COUNT()`**: Used within the final `CALCULATE` to count total payments per week (`COUNT(week_group)`) and weekend payments (`COUNT(week_group.WHERE(is_weekend == True))`).
*   **`.ORDER_BY()`**: Needed to sort the final results by the week start date in ascending order.
*   **`datetime.date`**: Required by `DATEDIFF` to specify the known Sunday reference date.

**3. Partitioning Strategy**
We need to aggregate payment counts per week. Therefore, `PARTITION` is necessary. We will partition the filtered and prepared `PaymentsReceived` data. The partitioning key will be the `week_start` date calculated for each payment using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`. This groups all payments from the same calendar week together.

**4. Ranking Considerations**
`RANKING` is not required for this query.

**5. Handling Ambiguity**
*   ""Calendar week"": Assumed to start on Sunday. `DATETIME(..., 'start of week')` typically handles this based on system/database locale, but we'll rely on its standard behavior.
*   ""Last 8 calendar weeks (excluding the current week)"": This is interpreted as the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week's start date.

**6. Code Generation**

# 2. Access their payments

# 7. Order the results by week ascending
final_weekly_summary = weekly_payment_summary.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())

```

**7. Step-by-Step Explanation**
1.  **Define Dates**: Calculate the start date of the current week (`current_week_start_date`) and the start date of the 8-week period we are interested in (`analysis_start_date`). Define a reference Sunday (`known_sunday_ref`) for day-of-week calculations.
2.  **Filter Sales & Payments**: Start with the `Sales` collection, filter for records where `sale_price` exceeds 30,000. Access the associated `payment` records (which links to `PaymentsReceived`).
3.  **Filter Payments by Date**: Filter these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated 8-week window (`>= analysis_start_date` and `< analysis_end_date`).
4.  **Calculate Week Info**: For each payment passing the filters, calculate two new fields:
    *   `week_start`: The date of the Sunday starting the week the payment occurred in.
    *   `is_weekend_payment`: A boolean flag set to `True` if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday (determined using `DATEDIFF` from `known_sunday_ref` and checking if the remainder modulo 7 is 0 or 6), and `False` otherwise.
5.  **Partition by Week**: Group the results from the previous step using `PARTITION`. The `payments_in_scope` collection is partitioned, naming each group `week_payment_group`, and using the calculated `week_start` field as the grouping key.
6.  **Aggregate Counts**: Apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `week_start` group:
    *   Select the `week_start` date itself, renaming it to `week`.
    *   Count the total number of payments within the group (`COUNT(week_payment_group)`) and name it `total_payments_received`.
    *   Count the number of payments within the group where the `is_weekend_payment` flag is true (`COUNT(week_payment_group.WHERE(is_weekend_payment == True))`) and name it `weekend_payments_received`.
7.  **Order Results**: Sort the final summary table (`weekly_payment_summary`) based on the `week` column in ascending order. The result is assigned to `final_weekly_summary`.","import datetime

**1. Analyze the Input**

The goal is to find the highest sale price for each unique combination of car `make` and `model`. The criteria for including a car in this calculation are:
*   The car must have at least one sale record (`Sales` collection).
*   The car's most recent inventory status (`InventorySnapshots` collection) must indicate it is *not* in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`).
The final output should list the `make`, `model`, and the corresponding `highest_sale_price`, ordered from the highest price to the lowest.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `Cars`: The starting point, as we need car details like `make`, `model`, and access to related `sale_records` and `inventory_snapshots`.
*   `WHERE`: To filter cars based on conditions:
    *   Presence of sales records (`HAS(sale_records)`).
    *   Presence of inventory snapshots (`HAS(inventory_snapshots)`). This is crucial to avoid errors when trying to find the latest snapshot.
    *   The status of the latest inventory snapshot (`is_in_inventory == False`).
*   `HAS`: To check if the `sale_records` and `inventory_snapshots` sub-collections are non-empty for a car.
*   `CALCULATE`:
    *   To compute intermediate values for each car: the maximum sale price for that car and the status of its latest inventory snapshot.
    *   To select the final output fields after partitioning (`make`, `model`, `highest_sale_price`).
*   `RANKING`: To identify the most recent inventory snapshot for each car based on `snapshot_date`. `levels=1` is essential here to rank snapshots *within* each car's context.
*   `SINGULAR`: To extract the single, latest inventory snapshot record after it's identified by `RANKING`. This is valid because the `RANKING` filter ensures we're dealing with only one record per car.
*   `MAX`:
    *   To find the maximum `sale_price` from all `sale_records` associated with a single car.
    *   After partitioning, to find the overall maximum sale price among all cars within a specific `make`/`model` group.
*   `PARTITION`: To group the filtered cars by their `make` and `model` so we can aggregate the highest sale price for each unique combination.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final aggregated results by the `highest_sale_price` in descending order.

**3. Partitioning Strategy**

`PARTITION` is necessary here because the request asks for the highest sale price *for each make and model*. We need to group the cars that meet the criteria by `make` and `model` and then find the maximum sale price within each group. Partitioning by `(make, model)` is the correct approach.

**4. Ranking Considerations**

`RANKING` is used on the `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection. `levels=1` ensures that the ranking (based on `snapshot_date`) is performed independently for the snapshots belonging to each car.

**5. Code Generation**

```python
# Step 1: Filter cars to ensure they have sales and snapshots, then calculate necessary per-car info
cars_filtered_info = Cars.WHERE(
    (HAS(sale_records) == 1) & (HAS(inventory_snapshots) == 1)

    ).SINGULAR().is_in_inventory,
    # Find the maximum sale price for this car across all its sales
    max_sale_price_for_car=MAX(sale_records.sale_price)

    # Keep only cars whose latest status is NOT in inventory
    latest_snapshot_is_in_inventory == False

**6. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  `cars_filtered_info = Cars.WHERE(...)`: We start with the `Cars` collection and apply an initial filter using `WHERE`.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: Ensures the car has at least one sale record.
    *   `HAS(inventory_snapshots) == 1`: Ensures the car has at least one inventory snapshot record (necessary to find the latest status).
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the cars that passed the initial filter, we calculate:
    *   `make=make, model=model`: Select the make and model.
    *   `latest_snapshot_is_in_inventory=...`: This finds the latest inventory snapshot for the *current* car (`levels=1` in `RANKING`) based on `snapshot_date`, extracts that single record (`SINGULAR()`), and gets its `is_in_inventory` status.
    *   `max_sale_price_for_car=MAX(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the highest sale price recorded for this specific car among all its sales records.
3.  `.WHERE(latest_snapshot_is_in_inventory == False)`: We apply a second filter to keep only those cars where the calculated `latest_snapshot_is_in_inventory` is `False`.
4.  `highest_sales_by_make_model = PARTITION(...)`: We take the `cars_filtered_info` collection (which now contains only sold cars, not in inventory, with their max sale price calculated) and partition it.
    *   `name='car_group'`: Names the groups for internal reference.
    *   `by=(make, model)`: Groups the cars based on their make and model.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each `car_group` (each unique make/model combination):
    *   `make=make, model=model`: Selects the make and model from the partition keys.
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(car_group.max_sale_price_for_car)`: Calculates the final result by finding the maximum value of `max_sale_price_for_car` among all cars belonging to that specific `make`/`model` group.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`: Sorts the final results (one row per make/model) based on the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order.","# Step 1: Filter cars to ensure they have sales and snapshots, then CALCULATE necessary per-car info

1.  **`DATETIME`**: This function is needed to:
    *   Calculate the start and end dates for the 6-month period relative to the current date (`'now'`). We need the start of the month (`'start of month'`) and date arithmetic (`'-6 months'`).
    *   Truncate the `sale_date` to the start of the month for monthly aggregation.
    *   Extract the `YEAR` from the `hire_date` for filtering salespersons.
2.  **`WHERE`**: This function is required to:
    *   Filter `Salespersons` based on their `hire_date` (years 2022-2023).
    *   Filter `Sales` records to include only those within the calculated 6-month date range.
3.  **`CALCULATE`**: This function is used to:
    *   Create a new field `sale_month` by truncating `sale_date`.
    *   Select the `sale_price` needed for aggregation.
    *   Select the final required fields (`month`, `PMSPS`, `PMSR`) after partitioning.
4.  **`PARTITION`**: This function is essential for grouping the filtered sales data by the calculated `sale_month`. This allows calculating metrics per month.
5.  **`COUNT`**: An aggregation function used within the `PARTITION`'s `CALCULATE` step to count the number of sales per month (`PMSPS`).
6.  **`SUM`**: An aggregation function used within the `PARTITION`'s `CALCULATE` step to sum the `sale_price` per month (`PMSR`).
7.  **`ORDER_BY`**: This function is used to sort the final results by month in ascending order as requested.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is necessary here to group sales data by month. The `PARTITION` will be applied to the `Sales` records *after* they have been filtered by salesperson hire date and sale date. The partitioning key will be the `sale_month` derived using `DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month')`.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Define the start and end dates for the relevant period (last 6 months excluding current)
start_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')
end_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month') # Use exclusive end date (start of current month)

# Assign the final result to a variable
final_monthly_sales_metrics = monthly_metrics_calculation

```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range**: `start_period_date` is calculated as the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month. `end_period_date` is calculated as the first day of the current month. Sales will be filtered to be on or after `start_period_date` and *before* `end_period_date`.
2.  **Filter Salespersons**: `target_salespersons` selects only those records from the `Salespersons` collection where the `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023.
3.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data**:
    *   We access the `sales_made` sub-collection for the `target_salespersons`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales to include only those with a `sale_date` within the defined `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`.
    *   `CALCULATE` derives `sale_month` by truncating the `sale_date` to the first day of its month and selects the `sale_price` (aliased as `sale_revenue` for clarity).
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**:
    *   `PARTITION` groups the `relevant_sales_data` based on the unique values of `sale_month`. Each group is accessible via the name `sales_per_month`.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` applied to the partition:
        *   `month = sale_month` selects the partitioning key (the month).
        *   `PMSPS = COUNT(sales_per_month)` counts the number of sales records within each monthly group.
        *   `PMSR = SUM(sales_per_month.sale_revenue)` sums the `sale_revenue` for all sales within each monthly group.
5.  **Order Results**: `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the resulting monthly metrics in ascending order based on the `month`.
6.  **Final Assignment**: The complete query result is assigned to the variable `final_monthly_sales_metrics`.

*Note*: This query will return rows only for the months within the specified period where the selected salespersons actually made sales.

```

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.
    2.  `total_values = GRAPH.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs calculations at the overall graph level.
        *   `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records filtered in the previous step, representing the total revenue for 2023.
        *   `total_cost_2023 = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`: It calculates the sum of the `cost` associated with each car sold in 2023 (accessed via `sales_in_2023.car.cost`), representing the total cost for 2023 sales.
    3.  `gpm_2023_result = total_values.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the GPM based on the previously computed totals.
        *   `gpm_calc = IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0.0, (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0)`: This applies the GPM formula: `(Revenue - Cost) / Cost * 100`. It uses `IFF` to return `0.0` if `total_cost_2023` is zero, preventing a division-by-zero error, otherwise, it computes the GPM. `100.0` ensures floating-point multiplication.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = gpm_calc)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the computed GPM (`gpm_calc`) and renames it to `gpm_2023`, ensuring only the requested value is returned.","# Filter sales that occurred in the year 2023

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to find the make, model, and sale price of a specific car. The criteria for this car are:
    *   It must have been sold (`Sales` collection).
    *   It must have an inventory snapshot indicating it went out of inventory (`InventorySnapshots` collection with `is_in_inventory == False`).
    *   The date of the sale (`sale_date` in `Sales`) must be the same as the date it went out of inventory (`snapshot_date` in `InventorySnapshots`).
    *   Among all cars meeting these criteria, we want the one with the highest `sale_price`.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Sales`: This is the primary collection to start from, as it contains the `sale_price` and links to both `Cars` and `InventorySnapshots` (indirectly via `Cars`).
    *   `WHERE`: To filter the `Sales` records based on the condition that the `sale_date` matches an `inventory_snapshot` date where the car is marked as out of inventory.
    *   `HAS`: To check if there exists at least one matching inventory snapshot for the car associated with the sale. We need `HAS(...) == 1` to explicitly check for existence.
    *   `car`: To navigate from a `Sales` record to the associated `Cars` record.
    *   `inventory_snapshots`: To navigate from a `Cars` record to its related `InventorySnapshots`.
    *   `TOP_K`: To select the single sale record with the highest `sale_price` after filtering.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To select and rename the final required fields (`make`, `model`, `sale_price`).

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not required because we are looking for a single global maximum (`TOP_K(1, ...)`), not grouping by any attribute.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not necessary; `TOP_K` is sufficient to find the single highest-priced item.

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   The query starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   It uses `WHERE` to filter these sales. The condition inside `WHERE` checks for the existence (`HAS(...) == 1`) of a related record.
    *   The `HAS` function looks into the `inventory_snapshots` associated with the `car` of the current `Sales` record.
    *   Within the snapshots, it filters for records where the `snapshot_date` is equal to the `sale_date` of the current sale *and* `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
    *   If such a snapshot exists for the car on the day it was sold, the sale record passes the `WHERE` filter.
    *   The filtered sales (`sales_on_exit_date`) are then processed by `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`, which selects the single sale record with the highest `sale_price`.
    *   Finally, `CALCULATE` is used on the resulting single record to extract the `make` and `model` from the related `car` and the `sale_price` from the sale record itself.","# Filter sales records to find those WHERE the car was sold on the same DAY

**1. Analysis and Function Selection**

*   We need data from the `PaymentsReceived` collection, specifically `payment_date` and `payment_amount`.
*   To group by month, we need to extract the year and month from `payment_date`. The `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions are suitable, but using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of month')` provides a single comparable value for each month/year combination, simplifying comparisons.
*   To calculate the total payments *per month*, we need to aggregate `payment_amount`. The `SUM()` aggregation function is required.
*   Grouping by month requires the `PARTITION` function. We'll partition by the start date of the month.
*   Calculating Month-over-Month (MoM) change requires accessing the total payment amount from the *previous* month for each *current* month. PyDough doesn't have a direct `LAG` function like SQL to access previous rows in an ordered group.
*   **Workaround for MoM**: We can first identify all unique months present in the data. Then, for each unique month, we calculate the total payments for that month and the total payments for the *preceding* calendar month using separate `SUM(WHERE(...))` aggregations. `DATETIME(date, '-1 month')` will be used to find the previous month's start date.
*   `CALCULATE` will be used multiple times: to extract the month start date, to perform the aggregations for current and previous months, and to compute the final MoM difference.
*   `ORDER_BY` is needed to present the results chronologically.
*   `DEFAULT_TO` is crucial to handle cases where sums might be zero or null (especially for the previous month calculation of the earliest month in the data).

**2. Partitioning Strategy**

*   We will partition the `PaymentsReceived` data (after calculating the month start date) by the `month_start_dt` to identify all unique months present in the dataset.

```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **`distinct_months_data`**: Creates an intermediate representation of `PaymentsReceived` where each record has a `month_start_dt` field, calculated by truncating the `payment_date` to the start of its month.
2.  **`unique_months`**: Partitions the `distinct_months_data` by `month_start_dt`. This effectively groups all records belonging to the same calendar month. The subsequent `CALCULATE` selects the unique `month_start_dt` (naming it `current_month_start`) and also calculates the start date of the immediately preceding calendar month (`previous_month_start`) using `DATETIME(..., '-1 month')`.
3.  **`monthly_analysis`**: Iterates through each unique month identified in `unique_months`. For each `current_month_start`:
    *   It extracts the `analysis_year` and `analysis_month`.
    *   It calculates `current_month_total_payment` by summing the `payment_amount` from all `PaymentsReceived` records whose `payment_date` falls within the `current_month_start`.
    *   It calculates `previous_month_total_payment` similarly, but summing amounts for records whose `payment_date` falls within the `previous_month_start`.
4.  **`final_monthly_payments_with_mom`**: Takes the results from `monthly_analysis` and:
    *   Selects the `year` and `month`.
    *   Calculates `total_payments`, using `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` to ensure a 0 is shown if a month had no payments (or if `SUM` returns null for an empty set).
    *   Calculates `mom_change` by subtracting the defaulted previous month's total from the defaulted current month's total. This correctly handles the first month in the dataset (where the previous month's total will be 0).
    *   Finally, it orders the results by year and then month.

**Important Note on ""All Months""**: This query calculates totals and MoM changes for all months *that have at least one payment record* in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. It does not generate rows for calendar months that might exist between the minimum and maximum payment dates but have zero associated payments. Achieving that would typically require a calendar dimension table or generation capabilities not standard in this PyDough context. The MoM calculation correctly compares a month's total to the *immediately preceding calendar month's* total, even if that preceding month had zero payments (its total would be calculated as 0).","# Step 1: Identify all unique months PRESENT in the data and CALCULATE the previous MONTH's start date

1.  `Salespersons`: This is the primary collection containing salesperson information.
2.  `TOP_K`: Required to select the top 3 salespersons based on a calculated metric (ASP). We use `TOP_K` instead of `ORDER_BY` followed by a limit, as per the guidelines.
3.  `CALCULATE`: Needed to compute the Average Selling Price (ASP) for each salesperson and to select the final required fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `ASP`).
4.  `SUM`: An aggregation function required to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` sub-collection.
5.  `COUNT`: An aggregation function required to count the total number of sales for each salesperson from their `sales_made` sub-collection.
6.  `IFF`: A conditional function used to handle potential division by zero when calculating ASP for salespersons who might have made zero sales. If the count of sales is zero, ASP will be set to 0.0.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

`PARTITION` is not necessary for this query. The required aggregations (total sales amount, number of sales) and the ASP calculation can be performed directly on the `Salespersons` collection using `CALCULATE` and aggregation functions within the `TOP_K` function's `by` parameter.

        *   `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Sums the sale price for all sales made by the salesperson.
        *   The `IFF` statement checks if the salesperson has made any sales (`COUNT(sales_made) > 0`). If yes, it calculates ASP (`SUM / COUNT`); otherwise, it returns `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

The `total_sales_amount` is computed by summing the `sale_price` for all sales records linked to each salesperson via the `sales_made` sub-collection.

1.  **Analyze the Input**: The goal is to identify cars from the `Cars` collection that do not have any corresponding entries in the `Sales` collection, indicating they haven't been sold. We need to return the `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year` for these cars. The request mentions a ""left join"" concept, which in PyDough translates to checking for the absence of related records in a sub-collection.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Cars`: This is the primary collection we need to query.
    *   `WHERE`: This function is needed to filter the cars based on the condition that they have no sales records.
    *   `HASNOT`: This aggregation function is ideal for checking if a sub-collection (in this case, `sale_records`) is empty. `HASNOT(sale_records)` will evaluate to true for cars with no sales.
    *   `CALCULATE`: This function is used to select and potentially rename the specific fields required in the output (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`).

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not necessary for this query as we are applying a simple filter directly to the `Cars` collection.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not needed as we are not ordering or selecting top/bottom records based on any criteria.

5.  **Code Generation**:

```python

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   `Cars`: Start with the `Cars` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`: Filter the `Cars` collection. The `HASNOT(sale_records)` function checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (linked from `Sales` via `Sales.car`) is empty for each car. We explicitly compare the result to `1` (True) to keep only those cars where `sale_records` is empty.

The `HAS(car_purchases)` function checks if the `car_purchases` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` collection) for each customer has one or more records. The `== 1` explicitly checks for the boolean True condition. Only customers with at least one purchase record remain.
    3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`: From the filtered list of customers, this selects only the `_id` field and renames it to `customer_id` in the final output.

1.  **`Salespersons`**: This is the primary collection we need to query, as we want information about salespersons.

    *   Second, after applying `TOP_K`, to select and rename the final required fields for the output.
3.  **`sales_made`**: This sub-collection within `Salespersons` links each salesperson to their sales records, which is essential for counting sales and summing revenue.
4.  **`WHERE`**: This function is needed within the aggregation functions (`COUNT` and `SUM`) to filter the `sales_made` sub-collection, including only sales that occurred within the last 30 days.
5.  **`DATETIME`**: This function is used with the arguments `'now'` and `'- 30 days'` to dynamically determine the start date for filtering sales records (i.e., 30 days prior to the current moment).
6.  **`COUNT`**: This aggregation function counts the number of sales records for each salesperson after applying the date filter.
7.  **`SUM`**: This aggregation function calculates the total `sale_price` from the filtered sales records for each salesperson.
8.  **`TOP_K`**: This function selects the top 5 salespersons based on the calculated sales count (`sales_count_last_30_days`) in descending order.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

`PARTITION` is not necessary for this query. The required aggregations (count of sales, sum of revenue) can be performed directly on the `Salespersons` collection using `CALCULATE` combined with aggregation functions applied to the filtered `sales_made` sub-collection.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_performance = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, storing them temporarily.
    *   `sales_count_last_30_days=COUNT(...)`: Calculates the number of sales for the salesperson. It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection, filters it using `WHERE` to keep only sales where `sale_date` is greater than or equal to 30 days ago (`DATETIME('now', '- 30 days')`), and then counts the remaining records using `COUNT`.
    *   `revenue_last_30_days=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(...), 0.0)`: Calculates the total revenue from those recent sales. It applies the same `WHERE` filter to `sales_made`, then sums the `sale_price` of the filtered records. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no sales in the period (resulting in a null sum), the revenue is reported as 0.0 instead of null.
2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=sales_count_last_30_days.DESC())`**: This method is chained after the first `CALCULATE`. It takes the results (salespersons with their calculated metrics) and selects the top 5 based on the `sales_count_last_30_days` field in descending order.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` is applied to the top 5 salespersons. It selects and renames the fields to match the requested output format: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_count`, and `total_revenue_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_customer_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the associated customer's state (`customer.state`), the sale price (`sale_price`), and the customer's unique ID (`customer._id`). We assign these to new field names (`cust_state`, `sale_revenue`, `customer_identifier`) for clarity.
2.  `state_sales_summary = PARTITION(...)`: We partition the `sales_with_customer_info` collection using the `cust_state` field. This groups all sales records by the state of the customer who made the purchase. The `name='state_sales_group'` assigns a name to access the records within each partition.
3.  `.CALCULATE(state=cust_state, ...)`: After partitioning, we perform calculations for each state group.
    *   `state=cust_state`: We select the state name (which is the partition key).
    *   `unique_customers=NDISTINCT(state_sales_group.customer_identifier)`: We count the number of distinct customer IDs within the current state's group (`state_sales_group`) to get the unique customer count for that state.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(state_sales_group.sale_revenue)`: We sum up the `sale_revenue` for all sales within the current state's group to get the total revenue for that state.
4.  `top_5_states_by_revenue = state_sales_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, we apply `TOP_K` to the results of the partition. We select the top `5` records based on the `total_revenue` field, sorted in descending (`DESC`) order.

1.  **Goal:** Find the top 5 car models by total sales revenue.
2.  **Data Needed:** Car make, car model, and sale price for each sale.
3.  **Collections:** `Cars` (for make, model) and `Sales` (for sale\_price and linking to cars).
4.  **Approach:**
    *   We need to group cars by their `make` and `model`. `PARTITION` is suitable for this.
    *   For each group (make/model combination), we need to calculate the total revenue (`SUM` of `sale_price` from associated sales) and the total number of sales (`COUNT` of associated sales).
    *   Finally, we need to select the top 5 groups based on the calculated total revenue using `TOP_K`.

**Function Selection:**

*   `PARTITION`: To group the `Cars` collection by `make` and `model`.
*   `CALCULATE`: Inside the `PARTITION`, to compute the aggregated values (`total_revenue`, `total_sales_count`) for each group and select the `make` and `model`.
*   `SUM`: To calculate the total revenue from the `sale_price` of all sales within each group.
*   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales records (`sale_records`) for each group.
*   `TOP_K`: To select the top 5 groups based on `total_revenue`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `PARTITION(Cars, name='model_group', by=(make, model))`: This groups all records in the `Cars` collection based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group is accessible via the name `model_group`.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make, car_model=model`: Selects the `make` and `model` which are the keys used for partitioning.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(model_group.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all `sale_records` associated with the cars belonging to the current `model_group`.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(model_group.sale_records)`: Counts the number of `sale_records` associated with the cars in the current `model_group`.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Takes the results from the `CALCULATE` (one row per make/model combination with its total revenue and sales count) and selects the top 5 rows based on the `total_revenue` in descending order.

**1. Analysis of the Request:**

*   We need to identify salespersons.
*   We need to look at their sales records (`Sales`).
*   We need to filter these sales to only include those within the last 3 months from today.
*   For each salesperson, we need to calculate the total revenue (`SUM` of `sale_price`) from these filtered sales.
*   We also need to count the total number of these filtered sales (`COUNT`).
*   We need to rank the salespersons based on their total revenue in descending order.
*   We need to select the top 3 salespersons from this ranking.
*   Finally, we need to return their first name, last name, total number of sales (in the period), and total revenue (in the period).

**2. Function Selection & Justification:**

*   `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`: To determine the start date of the relevant time period (3 months prior to the current moment).
*   `Salespersons`: The base collection to start from, as we want information about salespersons.
*   `WHERE`: Used within the aggregation context to filter the `sales_made` sub-collection based on the `sale_date`.
*   `CALCULATE`: To compute the aggregated values (total revenue and sales count) for each salesperson over the specified period and to select/rename the final output fields.
*   `SUM`: To aggregate the `sale_price` from the filtered sales for each salesperson.
*   `COUNT`: To count the number of filtered sales for each salesperson.
*   `TOP_K`: To select the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated `total_revenue_last_3m`.

**3. Partitioning Strategy:**

*   `PARTITION` is not required. We can achieve the goal by starting with the `Salespersons` collection and using `CALCULATE` with aggregation functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`) applied to the filtered `sales_made` sub-collection.

**4. Code Generation:**

**5. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_3m = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`: Defines the cutoff date; any sale on or after this date is considered within the ""past 3 months"".
2.  `salesperson_performance = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  `sp_first_name=first_name, sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the names initially.
4.  `recent_sales=sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3m)`: For each salesperson, it filters their associated sales (`sales_made`) to include only those that occurred on or after `start_date_3m`. The result is stored temporarily as `recent_sales`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used because we need to operate on the results of the first one (specifically, the filtered `recent_sales`).
6.  `total_revenue_last_3m=SUM(recent_sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for the `recent_sales` for each salesperson.
7.  `total_sales_last_3m=COUNT(recent_sales)`: Counts the number of `recent_sales` for each salesperson.
8.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue_last_3m.DESC())`: Sorts the results by `total_revenue_last_3m` in descending order and keeps only the top 3 records.
9.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields (`sp_first_name` to `first_name`, `sp_last_name` to `last_name`, `total_sales_last_3m` to `total_sales`, `total_revenue_last_3m` to `total_revenue`) to match the requested output format.

    *   `Salespersons`: To access the salesperson data.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter only those salespersons who have a `termination_date` (i.e., they were fired or left). The `PRESENT` function is used to check for non-null termination dates.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To compute the duration of employment using `DATEDIFF` between `hire_date` and `termination_date`. It's also used to select and format the final output fields.
    *   `DATEDIFF`: To calculate the difference between the hire date and termination date in days.
    *   `TOP_K`: To find the single salesperson with the minimum employment duration (`ASC` order).
    *   `JOIN_STRINGS`: To combine the `first_name` and `last_name` into a single `salesperson_name` field.
*   **Partitioning Strategy**: No `PARTITION` is needed as the calculation is done per salesperson and then the minimum is selected across all relevant salespersons.
*   **Ranking Considerations**: `TOP_K` is used here to find the minimum value, which is equivalent to ranking and selecting the top 1 in ascending order.

```python
# Find salespersons who have been terminated

    days_employed=employment_days
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `terminated_salespersons = Salespersons.WHERE(PRESENT(termination_date))`: This line filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is not null (i.e., the salesperson is no longer employed).
2.  `salesperson_employment_duration = terminated_salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates a new field `employment_days` for each terminated salesperson by finding the difference in days between their `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF`. It also carries forward the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone` (renamed to `phone_num`).
3.  `shortest_employed_salesperson = salesperson_employment_duration.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.TOP_K(1, by=employment_days.ASC())`: This selects the single record (`k=1`) from the `salesperson_employment_duration` collection that has the smallest value for `employment_days` (sorted ascending `ASC`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This takes the resulting single record and formats the output. It combines `first_name` and `last_name` into `salesperson_name` using `JOIN_STRINGS`, selects the phone number as `phone_number`, and selects the calculated duration as `days_employed`.

The final `shortest_employed_salesperson` variable holds the name, phone number, and employment duration (in days) for the salesperson employed for the shortest time.","# Find salespersons who have been terminated

Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company',"SELECT COUNT(*) AS weekend_payments FROM payments_made WHERE vendor_name = 'Utility Company' AND strftime('%w', payment_date) IN ('0', '6');",Dealership,"Okay, let's break this down.

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to count payments from the `PaymentsMade` collection that satisfy two conditions: the `vendor_name` must be 'Utility Company', and the `payment_date` must fall on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).
2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `PaymentsMade`: This is the base collection containing the payment records.
    *   `WHERE`: This function is needed to filter the payments based on the vendor name and the day of the week.
    *   `DAYOFWEEK`: This function is required to extract the day of the week from the `payment_date`. **Assumption**: We'll assume `DAYOFWEEK` exists and returns 6 for Saturday and 7 for Sunday, as it's not explicitly defined in the provided cheat sheet.
    *   `ISIN`: This function is useful for checking if the extracted day of the week is either 6 or 7.
    *   `COUNT`: This aggregation function is needed to count the number of records remaining after filtering.
    *   `GRAPH.CALCULATE`: This is used to calculate a single value (the total count) across the filtered collection.
3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not necessary here because we are not grouping the data. We just need a total count based on filters.
4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not required for this query.
5.  **Handling Ambiguity**: The main ambiguity is the lack of a `DAYOFWEEK` function in the reference. We proceed with the assumption that such a function exists, mapping Saturday to 6 and Sunday to 7.

```python
# Define the filter conditions
is_utility_company = (vendor_name == 'Utility Company')
# Assuming DAYOFWEEK function exists where Saturday=6 and Sunday=7
is_weekend = ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (6, 7))

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  `is_utility_company = (vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This defines a condition to check if the `vendor_name` field is exactly 'Utility Company'.
2.  `is_weekend = ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (6, 7))`: This defines a condition to check if the payment was made on a weekend. It assumes a `DAYOFWEEK` function exists where Saturday is 6 and Sunday is 7, and uses `ISIN` to check if the result is one of these values.
3.  `filtered_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(is_utility_company & is_weekend)`: This filters the `PaymentsMade` collection, keeping only the records that satisfy *both* the `is_utility_company` and `is_weekend` conditions using the logical AND operator (`&`).
4.  `result = GRAPH.CALCULATE(num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(filtered_payments))`: This calculates the final result. `GRAPH.CALCULATE` is used to compute a single aggregate value. `COUNT(filtered_payments)` counts the number of records in the `filtered_payments` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_range = GRAPH.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week relative to the current date (`'now'`).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '- 7 days')` calculates the date of the Monday of the previous week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '- 1 day')` calculates the date of the Sunday of the previous week.
2.  **`payments_in_prev_week = PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only records where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week (inclusive).
3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered payments.
    *   `payments_in_prev_week`: The collection to partition.
    *   `name='payments_group'`: Assigns a name to access the data within each partition.
    *   `by=(DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day'), payment_method)`: Specifies the keys to partition by. We use `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` to group by the specific day (truncating the time part) and `payment_method` to further split by the payment method.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output fields for each group:
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Selects the day of the payment (using the partition key).
    *   `pay_method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method (using the partition key).
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(payments_group.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records within the current partition (day and payment method group), accessed via the partition name `payments_group`.

    *   `CALCULATE`:
        *   First `CALCULATE`: To derive the customer's state (`customer.state`) and calculate the first date of the quarter for each transaction using `DATETIME`, `MONTH`, and arithmetic operations. It also selects the transaction `amount`.
        *   Second `CALCULATE` (after `PARTITION`): To select the grouping keys (state and quarter start date) and compute the sum of transaction amounts for each group.
    *   `customer.state`: Access the state information linked from the `Customers` collection.
    *   `YEAR`, `MONTH`: Extract year and month from the `date_time` field for filtering and quarter calculation.
    *   `DATETIME`: Construct the date representing the start of the quarter. The logic `DATETIME(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of year'), '+' + STR(((MONTH(date_time) - 1) // 3) * 3) + ' months')` calculates the first month of the quarter (0, 3, 6, 9) and adds it to the start of the transaction's year.
    *   `STR`: Convert the calculated month offset integer into a string compatible with the `DATETIME` function's interval modifier.
    *   `PARTITION`: Group the results by the calculated customer state and quarter start date.
    *   `SUM`: Aggregate the `amount` for each state-quarter group.
    *   `ORDER_BY`: Sort the final results by state and then by quarter for readability.

*   **Partitioning Strategy**:
    *   `PARTITION` is necessary to group the transactions.
    *   Partitioning is done by the derived `cust_state` and `quarter_start_dt` fields, which represent the customer's state and the first day of the quarter, respectively. These fields are calculated *before* the `PARTITION` step.

```python
# Calculate state and quarter start date for each transaction in 2023
transactions_in_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(YEAR(date_time) == 2023).CALCULATE(
    cust_state=customer.state,
    # Calculate the first date of the quarter: YYYY-01-01, YYYY-04-01, YYYY-07-01, YYYY-10-01
    quarter_start_dt=DATETIME(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of year'), '+' + STR(((MONTH(date_time) - 1) // 3) * 3) + ' months'),
    tx_amount=amount
)

# Partition by state and quarter, then sum the amounts
quarterly_sales_by_state = PARTITION(
    transactions_in_2023,
    name='state_quarter_group',

    state=cust_state,
    quarter_date=quarter_start_dt,
    total_sales=SUM(state_quarter_group.tx_amount)
).ORDER_BY(state.ASC(), quarter_date.ASC())

```

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `transactions_in_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Transactions` collection to include only records where the `date_time` falls within the year 2023.
    2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction:
        *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
        *   `quarter_start_dt=DATETIME(...)`: Calculates the first day of the quarter for the transaction's `date_time`. It finds the start of the year, then adds 0, 3, 6, or 9 months based on the transaction's month to get the first day of the corresponding quarter (Jan 1st, Apr 1st, Jul 1st, Oct 1st).
        *   `tx_amount=amount`: Selects the transaction amount.
    3.  `quarterly_sales_by_state = PARTITION(...)`: Groups the results from the previous step.
        *   `transactions_in_2023`: Specifies the data to partition.
        *   `name='state_quarter_group'`: Assigns a name to access the data within each partition group.
        *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start_dt)`: Defines the grouping keys: the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Performs calculations on each group created by `PARTITION`:
        *   `state=cust_state`: Selects the state (grouping key).
        *   `quarter_date=quarter_start_dt`: Selects the quarter start date (grouping key).
        *   `total_sales=SUM(state_quarter_group.tx_amount)`: Calculates the sum of transaction amounts (`tx_amount`) for all transactions belonging to the current state-quarter group.
    5.  `.ORDER_BY(state.ASC(), quarter_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first alphabetically by state, and then chronologically by the quarter date within each state.","# CALCULATE state and quarter start date for each transaction in 2023

1.  **Goal:** Find cars present in the inventory during the most recent snapshot taken in March 2023.
2.  **Collections:** We need `Cars` to get car details and `InventorySnapshots` to check inventory status and dates.
3.  **Filtering Snapshots:**
    *   We need snapshots specifically from March 2023. We'll use `YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023` and `MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`.
    *   We need the *latest* snapshot within that month for each car. `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), levels=1)` is suitable here. `levels=1` ensures we rank snapshots *per car*. We'll allow ties in case multiple snapshots exist on the latest date.
    *   We need snapshots where the car is marked as being in inventory: `is_in_inventory == True`.
4.  **Connecting to Cars:** We need to find `Cars` that *have* an `inventory_snapshot` meeting all the above criteria. The `HAS()` function is perfect for this.
5.  **Selecting Output:** Finally, we select the `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year` from the filtered cars using `CALCULATE`.

**Function Selection:**

*   `Cars`: Starting collection to get car details.
*   `inventory_snapshots`: Sub-collection accessed from `Cars`.
*   `WHERE`: To filter snapshots by date and inventory status.
*   `YEAR`, `MONTH`: To extract date parts for filtering.
*   `RANKING`: To identify the latest snapshot for each car within the specified month. `levels=1` is crucial for per-car ranking. `allow_ties=True` handles cases with multiple snapshots on the same latest date.
*   `HAS`: To check if a car possesses at least one snapshot matching the criteria.
*   `CALCULATE`: To select the final required fields from the `Cars` collection.

```python
# Define the filter condition for inventory snapshots:
# - Must be in March 2023
# - Must be the latest snapshot for that car in March 2023 (handling ties)
# - Must indicate the car is in inventory
latest_march_inventory_condition = (
    (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) &
    (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3) &
    (RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), levels=1, allow_ties=True) == 1) &
    (is_in_inventory == True)
)

# Filter Cars collection to find cars that have at least one snapshot meeting the condition
# Then, select the required fields for those cars.
cars_in_inventory_latest_march_2023 = Cars.WHERE(
    HAS(inventory_snapshots.WHERE(latest_march_inventory_condition)) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    _id=_id,
    make=make,
    model=model,
    year=year
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_march_inventory_condition`: This contextless expression defines the criteria for an inventory snapshot we are interested in. It combines checks for the year (2023), month (3), uses `RANKING` on `snapshot_date` descending (within each car, `levels=1`) to find the latest snapshot(s), and ensures `is_in_inventory` is True.
2.  `Cars.WHERE(...)`: We filter the main `Cars` collection.
3.  `HAS(inventory_snapshots.WHERE(latest_march_inventory_condition)) == 1`: This is the core logic. For each car, it checks if it `HAS` at least one (`== 1`) related `inventory_snapshot` that satisfies the `latest_march_inventory_condition`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the cars that pass the `WHERE` filter, we select their `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`.","# Define the filter condition for inventory snapshots:
# - Must be in March 2023
# - Must be the latest snapshot for that car in March 2023 (handling ties)
# - Must indicate the car is in inventory
