Here's my plan to convert the natural language description into PyDough code.

1.  **Collections Needed**: I need to start with the `Sales` collection and `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  **Filtering**: I need to filter sales with `sale_price` over $30,000.
3.  **Date Range**: I need to consider the last 8 calendar weeks, excluding the current week. This will involve some date calculations.
4.  **Aggregation**: I need to calculate the total payments received and the payments received on weekends.
5.  **Partitioning**: I will need to partition by week to group the payments.
6.  **Sorting**: Finally, I need to sort the results by week in ascending order.
7.  **Functions**: I will use `SUM`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `DATEDIFF`, `DATETIME`, `PARTITION`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER_BY`.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
start_date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=today.weekday() + 7 * 8)
end_date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=today.weekday() + 7)

sales_filtered = Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)

    total_payments_received=SUM(weekly_sales.total_payments),
    total_weekend_payments=SUM(weekly_sales.weekend_payments)
).ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())

result = weekly_payments
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Date Range**:
    *   Calculate the `start_date` and `end_date` to define the last 8 calendar weeks, excluding the current week.

2.  **Filter Sales**:
    *   `sales_filtered = Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000.

3.  **Calculate Payments**:
    *   `sales_with_payments = sales_filtered.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates the total payments and weekend payments for each sale.
        *   `total_payments=SUM(payment.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of all `payment_amount` values from the `payment` sub-collection.
        *   `weekend_payments=SUM(payment.KEEP_IF(payment_amount, (DAY(payment.payment_date) == 0) | (DAY(payment.payment_date) == 6)))`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` values for payments made on weekends (Saturday and Sunday). `DAY()` function returns the day of the week (0 for Sunday, 6 for Saturday).

4.  **Filter by Date Range**:
    *   `sales_in_range = sales_with_payments.WHERE((sale_date >= start_date) & (sale_date <= end_date))`: Filters the sales to include only those within the calculated date range.

5.  **Partition by Week**:
    *   `weekly_payments = PARTITION(sales_in_range, name=""weekly_sales"", by=(YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date), DATEDIFF(""days"", DATETIME(YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date), 1), sale_date) // 7)).CALCULATE(...)`: Partitions the sales by week.
        *   The `by` parameter uses `YEAR(sale_date)`, `MONTH(sale_date)`, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", DATETIME(YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date), 1), sale_date) // 7` to group sales by week.
        *   `week_start=DATETIME(YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date), 1, ""+ "" + STR(DATEDIFF(""days"", DATETIME(YEAR(sale_date), MONTH(sale_date), 1), sale_date) // 7 * 7) + "" days"")`: Calculates the start date of the week.
        *   `total_payments_received=SUM(weekly_sales.total_payments)`: Calculates the sum of total payments for each week.
        *   `total_weekend_payments=SUM(weekly_sales.weekend_payments)`: Calculates the sum of weekend payments for each week.

6.  **Sort by Week**:
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())`: Sorts the results by the week start date in ascending order.

7.  **Final Result**:
    *   `result = weekly_payments`: Assigns the final result to the `result` variable.

2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"") | LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)`: Converts the `make` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` field contains ""ford"" as a substring. The `%` is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).
    *   `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `model` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` field contains ""mustang"" as a substring.
    *   `|`: The `|` operator is the logical OR operator. So, the `WHERE` clause selects cars where either the `make` contains ""ford"" or the `model` contains ""mustang"".
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates the desired fields for the filtered cars.
    *   `make=make`: Selects the `make` field.
    *   `model=model`: Selects the `model` field.
    *   `year=year`: Selects the `year` field.
    *   `color=color`: Selects the `color` field.
    *   `vin_number=vin_number`: Selects the `vin_number` field.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the average sale price for each car by averaging the `sale_price` from the related `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition:**
    *   Calculates the start and end dates for the last 6 months, excluding the current month.

2.  **Filter Qualified Salespersons:**
    *   Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive).

3.  **Calculate Monthly Sales:**
    *   Calculates the monthly sales for each qualified salesperson within the defined date range.
    *   Uses `DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month')` to truncate the `sale_date` to the beginning of the month.

4.  **Partition and Aggregate:**
    *   Partitions the monthly sales data by `month` and `salesperson_id`.
    *   Calculates `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) using `COUNT(monthly_sales_partition)`.
    *   Calculates `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) using `SUM(monthly_sales_partition.sale_price)`.

5.  **Generate All Months:**
    *   Creates a list of all months within the last 6 months.
    *   Creates a `GRAPH` collection with all months to ensure all months are returned in the final result, even if there were no sales.

6.  **Left Join and Final Calculation:**
    *   Performs a left join between the `all_months` collection and the `pmsps_pmsr` collection.
    *   Uses `DEFAULT_TO` to set `PMSPS` and `PMSR` to 0 for months where there were no sales.
    *   Orders the final result by month in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Payments:**
   - The code starts by calculating the `month`, `year`, and `payment_amount` from the `PaymentsReceived` collection. This creates a new collection called `monthly_payments` with these calculated fields.

2. **Partition by Year and Month:**
   - The `monthly_payments` collection is then partitioned by `year` and `month` using the `PARTITION` function. This groups the payments by year and month, creating a partition named ""monthly"".
   - Inside the `CALCULATE` function of the partition, the `SUM` function is used to calculate the `total_payments` for each month.

3. **Order by Year and Month:**
   - The `partitioned_payments` collection is ordered by `year` and `month` in ascending order using the `ORDER_BY` function. This ensures that the months are in chronological order for the MoM calculation.

4. **Calculate MoM Change:**
   - Finally, the `mom_change` collection is created by calculating the MoM change for each month.
   - The `RELSUM` function is used to calculate the sum of the `total_payments` for the previous month. The `levels=1` argument specifies that the sum should be calculated within each year.
   - The MoM change is then calculated by subtracting the previous month's total payments from the current month's total payments.

    *   We'll be working with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   We'll need to filter transactions by date.

1.  **Calculate the total sales amount and number of sales for each salesperson:** We'll start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` along with aggregation functions (`SUM` and `COUNT`) on the `sales_made` sub-collection to compute the total sales amount and the number of sales for each salesperson.
2.  **Calculate the ASP for each salesperson:**  We'll use `CALCULATE` again to divide the total sales amount by the number of sales to get the ASP.
3.  **Find the top 3 salespersons by ASP:** We'll use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 salespersons based on their ASP in descending order.
4.  **Select the required fields:** Finally, we'll use `CALCULATE` to select the salesperson's first name, last name, and ASP.

2.  **Filtering**: We need to filter `PaymentsReceived` to only include records where the `payment_method` is 'Cash'.

3.  **Aggregation**: We need to extract the distinct `salesperson_id` values. We can use `PARTITION` to group by `salesperson_id` and then select the distinct IDs.

3.  **Constructing the Query:** We'll start with the `Salespersons` collection, filter it using `WHERE` and `HASNOT` to find those without sales, and then use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields.

1.  **Calculate Employment Duration:** We need to calculate the difference between `hire_date` and `termination_date` for each salesperson. We'll use `DATEDIFF` to get the duration in days.
2.  **Handle Missing Termination Dates:** Some salespersons might not have a `termination_date`. We'll use `DEFAULT_TO` to replace missing `termination_date` values with the current date, ensuring they are included in the calculation.
3.  **Find the Minimum Duration:** We need to find the minimum employment duration among all salespersons.
4.  **Retrieve Salesperson Information:** Once we have the minimum duration, we'll filter the salespersons to find the one(s) with that duration and retrieve their name, phone number, and employment duration.

```python
from datetime import datetime

shortest_employment = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    first_name=first_name,
    last_name=last_name,
    phone=phone,

    employment_duration=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)
).ORDER_BY(employment_duration.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates the calculation on the `Salespersons` collection.
*   **`first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name, phone=phone`**: Selects the first name, last name, and phone number of the salesperson.
*   **`termination_date = DEFAULT_TO(termination_date, datetime.now())`**: If a salesperson has a `termination_date`, it uses that date. If `termination_date` is missing (null), it defaults to the current date (`datetime.now()`). This ensures that currently employed salespersons are also considered in the duration calculation.
*   **`employment_duration=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`**: Calculates the difference in days between the `hire_date` and the (potentially defaulted) `termination_date`. This gives us the employment duration.
*   **`.ORDER_BY(employment_duration.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration.ASC())`**: Orders the salespersons by `employment_duration` in ascending order and selects the top 1, effectively finding the salesperson with the shortest employment duration.

Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company',"SELECT COUNT(*) AS weekend_payments FROM payments_made WHERE vendor_name = 'Utility Company' AND strftime('%w', payment_date) IN ('0', '6');",Dealership,"Here's how we can approach this problem:

1.  **Identify the Collection**: We need to start with the `PaymentsMade` collection since we are interested in payments.
2.  **Filter for the Vendor**: We need to filter the `PaymentsMade` collection to only include payments made to 'Utility Company'.
3.  **Filter for Weekends**: We need to filter the payments to include only those made on weekends. We can use the `DAY` function to extract the day of the week (Sunday=0, Saturday=6) and check if it's a weekend.
4.  **Count the Payments**: Finally, we need to count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.

```python
payments_made_on_weekends = PaymentsMade.WHERE(
    (vendor_name == 'Utility Company') &
    (DAY(payment_date) == 0) | (DAY(payment_date) == 6)
)
num_payments = COUNT(payments_made_on_weekends)
```

**Explanation:**

*   The code first filters the `PaymentsMade` collection using the `WHERE` function.
*   The filter condition checks if the `vendor_name` is equal to 'Utility Company' AND if the day of the week of the `payment_date` is either 0 (Sunday) or 6 (Saturday).
*   The result of the filtering is assigned to the variable `payments_made_on_weekends`.
*   Finally, the `COUNT` function counts the number of records in the filtered collection, giving us the number of payments made on weekends to 'Utility Company'.

1.  **Determine the previous ISO week:** We need to calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week. Since PyDough doesn't have direct ISO week functions, we'll need to use a combination of date functions to achieve this.

2.  **Filter PaymentsReceived:** Filter the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments made within the calculated date range of the previous ISO week.

3.  **Partition by payment\_method:** Group the filtered payments by `payment_method`.

4.  **Calculate total amount:** Calculate the sum of `payment_amount` for each payment method within the previous ISO week.

5.  **Final Result:** The final result should contain the `payment_method` and the corresponding `total_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import datetime:** Imports the `datetime` module to work with dates and times.
2.  **Calculate previous ISO week:** Calculates the start and end dates of the previous ISO week using `datetime` functions. It handles the case where the previous week is in the previous year.
3.  **Filter PaymentsReceived:** Filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments made within the calculated date range.  The `payment_date` is compared against `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` to ensure that only payments within the previous ISO week are included.
4.  **Partition by payment\_method:** Partitions the filtered payments by `payment_method` using the `PARTITION` function. The partition is named `daily_payment`.
5.  **Calculate total amount:** Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for each `payment_method` within the partition using the `SUM` aggregation function.
6.  **Final Result:** The `daily_payments` variable will contain the `payment_method` and the corresponding `total_amount` for the previous ISO week.

The quarters will be represented by the first date of each quarter.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales records from the year 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** Calculate the quarter start date (first day of the quarter) and extract the customer's state.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** Partition the data by customer's state and the quarter start date.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** Calculate the sum of `sale_price` for each state and quarter.
5.  **Present the Results:** Display the state, quarter start date, and total sales for that quarter.

```python
quarterly_sales = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(
    customer_state=customer.state,
    quarter_start=DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month'),
).CALCULATE(
    quarter_start=DATETIME(quarter_start, '- (MONTH(quarter_start) - 1) months', 'start of month')

    state=customer_state,
    quarter=quarter_start,
    total_sales=SUM(sales.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** The first `WHERE` clause filters the `Sales` collection, keeping only the sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** The first `CALCULATE` expression extracts the customer's state from the `customer.state` field and calculates the `quarter_start` date by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of the month. The second `CALCULATE` expression truncates the `quarter_start` to the start of the quarter.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by `customer_state` and `quarter_start`. The name ""sales"" is assigned to each group.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** The `CALCULATE` function within the `PARTITION` calculates the `total_sales` for each group by summing the `sale_price` of the sales records in that group. It also selects the `customer_state` and `quarter_start` for each group.
5.  **Present the Results:** The final result, `quarterly_sales_by_state`, contains the total sales for each customer state and quarter in 2023.
