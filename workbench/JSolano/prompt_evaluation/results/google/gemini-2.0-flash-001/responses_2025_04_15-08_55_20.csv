**1. Understanding the Requirements**

*   We need to analyze `Sales` records where `sale_price > 30000`.
*   For these sales, we need to look at related `PaymentsReceived` records.
*   We need to group the payments by week.
*   We need to calculate the total payments and the payments made on weekends for each week.
*   We need to consider only the last 8 completed calendar weeks (excluding the current week).
*   The output should include the week's date, total payments, and weekend payments, sorted by week in ascending order.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `WHERE`: To filter `Sales` records based on `sale_price`.
*   `JOIN`: To link `Sales` records to `PaymentsReceived` records.  Implicitly done via sub-collection access.
*   `CALCULATE`: To derive the week number and a flag indicating if a payment was made on a weekend.
*   `PARTITION`: To group the payments by week.
*   `SUM`: To calculate the total payments and weekend payments for each week.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the results by week.
*   `DATETIME`: To get the start of the week.
*   `DATEDIFF`: To filter the last 8 weeks.
*   `DAY`: To determine if the payment was made on a weekend.

**3. Code Generation**

```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
start_of_this_week = today - datetime.timedelta(days=today.weekday())
eight_weeks_ago = start_of_this_week - datetime.timedelta(weeks=8)

high_value_sales = Dealership.Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)

payments_with_week = high_value_sales.payment.CALCULATE(
    payment_date=payment_date,
    week_start=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of d') - datetime.timedelta(days=DAY(payment_date) % 7),
    is_weekend=ISIN(DAY(payment_date) % 7, (5, 6))
)

weekly_payments = PARTITION(payments_with_week, name='weekly_payments', by=week_start).CALCULATE(
    week_start=week_start,
    total_payments=SUM(weekly_payments.payment_amount),
    weekend_payments=SUM(KEEP_IF(weekly_payments.payment_amount, weekly_payments.is_weekend == 1))
).WHERE((week_start >= eight_weeks_ago) & (week_start < start_of_this_week)).ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())

result = weekly_payments
```

**4. Code Explanation**

*   First, we calculate the start of the current week and the date 8 weeks ago using `datetime` library.
*   `high_value_sales`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales with a `sale_price` greater than 30000.
*   `payments_with_week`: Calculates the week start date and a weekend flag for each payment associated with the high-value sales.  The week start is calculated by subtracting the day of the week (modulo 7) from the payment date. The `is_weekend` flag is set to 1 if the day of the week is 5 (Saturday) or 6 (Sunday), and 0 otherwise.
*   `weekly_payments`: Partitions the payments by `week_start` and calculates the `total_payments` and `weekend_payments` for each week.  `KEEP_IF` is used to only sum the payments that occurred on weekends.
*   The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only the last 8 completed weeks, excluding the current week.
*   `ORDER_BY`: Sorts the results by `week_start` in ascending order.
*   `result`: Assigns the final query to the `result` variable.

1.  **Filter Sales:** We need to filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the last 30 days. We can use `DATEDIFF` to calculate the difference between the current date and the `sale_date`.
2.  **Group by Salesperson:** We need to group the filtered sales by salesperson to count the number of sales each salesperson made. We can use `PARTITION` for this.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Total Sales and Number of Sales:**
   - The code starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
   - It uses `CALCULATE` to derive the following fields for each salesperson:
     - `first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
     - `last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
     - `total_sales_amount`: The sum of `sale_price` from the `sales_made` sub-collection (representing all sales made by that salesperson). `SUM` is used because `sales_made` is a plural sub-collection.
     - `number_of_sales`: The count of `sales_made` (representing the number of sales made by that salesperson). `COUNT` is used because `sales_made` is a plural sub-collection.
   - The result is assigned to the `salesperson_sales` variable.

2. **Rank Salespersons by Total Sales Amount:**
   - The code then takes the `salesperson_sales` collection and uses `CALCULATE` again to add a sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.
   - `RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())` calculates the rank based on the `total_sales_amount` in descending order (highest sales amount gets the best rank).
   - The result is assigned to the `salesperson_sales_ranked` variable.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The `result` variable is assigned the value of `salesperson_sales_ranked`, which contains the first name, last name, total sales amount, number of sales, and sales rank for each salesperson.

Finally, we need to order the results by the highest sale price in descending order.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Find the latest snapshot date for each car:** We'll use `PARTITION` on `InventorySnapshots` by `car_id` to find the maximum `snapshot_date`.
2.  **Filter inventory snapshots:** We'll filter the `InventorySnapshots` to only include the latest snapshot for each car.

4.  **Calculate the highest sale price for each make and model:** We'll use `PARTITION` on `Sales` by `car.make` and `car.model` to find the maximum `sale_price`.
5.  **Join the results:** We'll filter the sales records to only include cars that are not in inventory based on the latest snapshot.
6.  **Order the results:** We'll order the final result by the maximum sale price in descending order.

2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"") | LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)`: Converts the `make` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` field contains ""ford"" as a substring. The `%` symbols are wildcards, meaning any characters can appear before or after ""ford"".
    *   `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `model` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` field contains ""mustang"" as a substring.
    *   `|`: The `|` symbol represents the logical OR operator. So, the `WHERE` clause selects cars where either the `make` contains ""ford"" or the `model` contains ""mustang"".
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates the desired fields for the filtered cars.
    *   `make=make`: Selects the `make` field.
    *   `model=model`: Selects the `model` field.
    *   `year=year`: Selects the `year` field.
    *   `color=color`: Selects the `color` field.
    *   `vin_number=vin_number`: Selects the `vin_number` field.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the average sale price for each car by averaging the `sale_price` from the related `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Date Range:**
    *   Calculates the date 6 months ago from the current month.
    *   Creates a list of tuples with year and month for each of the last 6 months.

2.  **Filter Salespersons:**
    *   Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive).

3.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics:**
    *   Iterates through each month in the `months` list.
    *   For each month, filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in that month.
    *   Calculates `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) and `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) for each salesperson in the filtered_salespersons collection.
        *   `COUNT(sales_this_month.WHERE(sales_this_month.salesperson_id == _id))` counts the number of sales made by each salesperson in the current month.
        *   `SUM(sales_this_month.WHERE(sales_this_month.salesperson_id == _id).sale_price)` calculates the total sales revenue for each salesperson in the current month.
    *   Extends the `monthly_metrics` list with the calculated metrics for the current month.

4.  **Order Results:**
    *   Orders the `monthly_metrics` collection by year and month in ascending order.

5.  **Final Result:**
    *   Assigns the ordered metrics to the `result` variable.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Payments:**
   - The code starts by calculating the `month`, `year`, and `payment_amount` from the `PaymentsReceived` collection. This creates a new collection called `monthly_payments` with these calculated fields.

2. **Partition by Year and Month:**
   - The `monthly_payments` collection is then partitioned by `year` and `month` using the `PARTITION` function. This groups the payments by year and month, creating a partition named ""monthly"".
   - Inside the `CALCULATE` function of the partition, the `SUM` function is used to calculate the `total_payments` for each month.

3. **Order by Year and Month:**
   - The `partitioned_payments` collection is ordered by `year` and `month` in ascending order using the `ORDER_BY` function. This ensures that the months are in chronological order for the MoM calculation.

4. **Calculate MoM Change:**
   - Finally, the `mom_change` collection is created by calculating the MoM change for each month.
   - The `RELSUM` function is used to calculate the sum of the `total_payments` for the previous month. The `levels=1` argument specifies that the sum should be calculated within each month.
   - The MoM change is then calculated by subtracting the previous month's total payments from the current month's total payments.

2.  **Filtering**: We need to filter `PaymentsReceived` to only include records where the `payment_method` is 'Cash'.

3.  **Aggregation**: We need to extract the distinct `salesperson_id` values. We can use `PARTITION` to group by `salesperson_id` and then select the distinct IDs.

Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company',"SELECT COUNT(*) AS weekend_payments FROM payments_made WHERE vendor_name = 'Utility Company' AND strftime('%w', payment_date) IN ('0', '6');",Dealership,"Here's how we can approach this problem:

1.  **Identify the Collection**: We need to work with the `PaymentsMade` collection.
2.  **Filter for the Vendor**: We need to filter the payments to only include those made to 'Utility Company'.
3.  **Filter for Weekends**: We need to determine which payments were made on weekends (Saturday or Sunday).
4.  **Count the Payments**: Finally, we need to count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
payments_made_on_weekends = PaymentsMade.WHERE(
    (vendor_name == 'Utility Company') &
    (ISIN(DAY(payment_date), (6, 7)))
)
number_of_payments = GRAPH.CALCULATE(number_of_payments = COUNT(payments_made_on_weekends))
```

**Explanation:**

*   The first line filters the `PaymentsMade` collection for payments made to 'Utility Company' and also checks if the day of the week is either 6 (Saturday) or 7 (Sunday).
*   The second line counts the number of payments that satisfy the filter conditions and assigns the result to the variable `number_of_payments`.

1.  **Determine the previous ISO week:** We need to calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week. Since PyDough doesn't have direct ISO week functions, we'll need to use a combination of date functions to achieve this.

2.  **Filter PaymentsReceived:** Filter the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments made within the calculated date range of the previous ISO week.

3.  **Partition by payment\_method:** Group the filtered payments by `payment_method`.

4.  **Calculate total amount:** Calculate the sum of `payment_amount` for each payment method within the previous ISO week.

5.  **Final Result:** The final result should contain the `payment_method` and the corresponding `total_amount`.

```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
iso_calendar = today.isocalendar()
current_iso_year, current_iso_week, current_iso_day = iso_calendar

# Calculate the start date of the previous ISO week
previous_iso_week = current_iso_week - 1

    payment_method=PaymentsReceived.payment_method,
    total_amount=SUM(daily_payment.payment_amount)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import datetime:** Imports the `datetime` module to work with dates and times.
2.  **Calculate Previous ISO Week:** Calculates the start and end dates for the previous ISO week using `datetime` functions. It handles the edge case where the previous week is in the previous year.
3.  **Filter PaymentsReceived:** Filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments made within the calculated date range.  The `payment_date` is compared against `start_datetime` and `end_datetime` to ensure that only payments within the previous ISO week are included.
4.  **Partition by payment\_method:** Partitions the filtered payments by `payment_method` using the `PARTITION` function. The partition is named `daily_payment`.
5.  **Calculate total amount:** Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for each `payment_method` within the partition using the `SUM` aggregation function.
6.  **Final Result:** The `daily_payments` variable will contain the `payment_method` and the corresponding `total_amount` for the previous ISO week.

The quarters will be represented by the first date of each quarter.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales records from the year 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** Calculate the quarter start date (first day of the quarter) and extract the customer's state.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** Partition the data by customer's state and the quarter start date.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** Calculate the sum of `sale_price` for each state and quarter.
5.  **Present the Results:** Display the state, quarter start date, and total sales for that quarter.

```python
quarterly_sales = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(
    customer_state=customer.state,
    quarter_start=DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month'),
).CALCULATE(
    quarter_start=DATETIME(quarter_start, '- (MONTH(quarter_start) - 1) months', 'start of month')
)

quarterly_sales_by_state = PARTITION(quarterly_sales, name='sales', by=(customer_state, quarter_start)).CALCULATE(
    state=customer_state,
    quarter=quarter_start,
    total_sales=SUM(sales.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** The `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters the sales data to include only transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** The `.CALCULATE(...)` block calculates the `customer_state` and `quarter_start`. The `quarter_start` is calculated by first truncating the `sale_date` to the start of the month, and then subtracting the number of months to get to the start of the quarter.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** The `PARTITION` function groups the sales data by `customer_state` and `quarter_start`.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** The `.CALCULATE(...)` following the `PARTITION` calculates the `total_sales` for each group (state and quarter) by summing the `sale_price`.
5.  **Present the Results:** The final result `quarterly_sales_by_state` contains the `state`, `quarter`, and `total_sales` for each customer state and quarter in 2023.
