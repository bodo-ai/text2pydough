1.  **Filter Customers:** We need to consider only those customers who have made at least 5 transactions.
2.  **Calculate Success Rate:** For each of these customers, we need to calculate the success rate of their transactions. This will involve counting the total number of transactions and the number of successful transactions.
3.  **Order Results:** Finally, we need to order the results by the success rate, from lowest to highest.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
customer_transaction_info = Broker.Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    successful_transactions=SUM(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'COMPLETED').amount)

).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())

results = customer_transaction_info.CALCULATE(customer_name=customer_name, success_rate=success_rate)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`Broker.Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers who have 5 or more transactions.
*   **.CALCULATE(...)**: This calculates the `customer_name`, `total_transactions`, and `successful_transactions` for each customer.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for each customer.
    *   `successful_transactions=SUM(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'COMPLETED').amount)`: Counts the number of successful transactions for each customer.
*   **.CALCULATE(success\_rate=100.0 \* successful\_transactions / total\_transactions)**: Calculates the success rate as a percentage.
*   **.ORDER\_BY(success\_rate.ASC())**: Orders the results by the success rate in ascending order.
*   **.CALCULATE(customer\_name=customer\_name, success\_rate=success\_rate)**: Selects the customer name and success rate for the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter FAANG Tickers:**
    *   `faang_tickers = Tickers.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Tickers` collection to include only those tickers whose symbols start with ""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", or ""NFLX"". The `LIKE` function with the `%` wildcard is used for pattern matching.

2.  **Filter Customers with .com Email:**

3.  **Find Distinct Customers Who Bought FAANG Stocks:**
    *   `distinct_customers_bought_faang = customers_with_com_email.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker_id, faang_tickers._id))) == 1)`: This is the core of the query. It filters `customers_with_com_email` to find customers who have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) involving a FAANG stock.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker_id, faang_tickers._id))`: This subquery filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker_id` is present in the `faang_tickers._id` collection (i.e., transactions involving FAANG stocks).
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This checks if the customer has at least one transaction that satisfies the condition of being a FAANG stock transaction.

4.  **Count Distinct Customers:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Customers:** The code first filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers whose `join_date` is on or after January 1, 2023. The country is calculated using CALCULATE.
2.  **Partition by Country:** The filtered customers are then partitioned by their `country` using the `PARTITION` function. This groups the customers by country.
3.  **Count Customers per Country:** Within each country partition, the `CALCULATE` function is used along with the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of customers in each country. The country and the count are returned.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Stock Transactions and Calculate Week Number:**

    *   It then calculates the start of the week for each transaction using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of d')` and the day of the week using `DAY(date_time)`.
2.  **Calculate Weeks Ago:**
    *   Calculates how many weeks ago each transaction occurred using `DATEDIFF('days', week_start, DATETIME('now')) / 7`.
3.  **Filter Last 8 Weeks:**
    *   Filters the transactions to include only those that occurred in the last 8 weeks, excluding the current week, using `WHERE((weeks_ago > 0) & (weeks_ago <= 8))`.
4.  **Partition by Week and Count Total Transactions:**
    *   Partitions the transactions by `week_start` using `PARTITION(last_8_weeks_transactions, name='weekly_tx', by=week_start)`.
    *   Counts the total number of transactions per week using `COUNT(weekly_tx)`.
5.  **Filter Weekend Transactions:**
    *   Filters the transactions to include only those that occurred on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) using `WHERE((day_of_week == 6) | (day_of_week == 7))`.
6.  **Partition by Week and Count Weekend Transactions:**

    *   Counts the number of weekend transactions per week using `COUNT(weekly_weekend_tx)`.
7.  **Combine Results:**
    *   Combines the results of the total transactions per week and the weekend transactions per week using `CALCULATE`.

1.  **Filter Customers:** We need to filter customers who are from the USA.
2.  **Filter Transactions:** We need to filter transactions made last week. Since we don't have a direct ""last week"" filter, we'll need to use date functions and potentially the current date to define the range.
3.  **Aggregate Transactions:** Count the number of transactions and sum the transaction amounts for the filtered transactions.

*   **Filter transactions:** Filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection of the `usa_customers` collection to include only transactions that occurred within the calculated date range (last week).
*   **Aggregate results:** Use the `CALCULATE` function on the `Broker` collection to count the number of transactions (`COUNT`) and sum the transaction amounts (`SUM`) from the filtered `last_week_transactions`. The results are assigned to `number_of_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount` respectively.

3.  **Calculate PMCS (Per Month Customer Signups):** Partition the filtered customers by the month and year of their `join_date` to count the number of signups per month.

4.  **Calculate PMAT (Per Month Average Transaction Amount):** For each month, calculate the average transaction amount for the customers who signed up in that month. This involves accessing the `transactions_made` sub-collection and calculating the average `amount` for each transaction.

5.  **Final Result:** Combine the PMCS and PMAT results, displaying the month, year, PMCS, and PMAT.

**Explanation:**

*   **Date Range Calculation:** The code first calculates the date range for the last 6 months, excluding the current month, using `datetime` module.
*   **Filtering Customers:** The `WHERE` clause filters the `Customers` collection based on the calculated date range. The `CALCULATE` function extracts the month and year of the `join_date` for partitioning.
*   **Partitioning and Aggregation:** The `PARTITION` function groups the filtered customers by their signup month and year. The `CALCULATE` function then calculates the PMCS (per month customer signups) using `COUNT(cust_month)` and the PMAT (per month average transaction amount) using `AVG(cust_month.transactions_made.amount)`.
*   **Final Result:** The `result` variable holds the final query result, containing the month, year, PMCS, and PMAT for each month in the specified date range.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Customers Joined in 2022:**
    *   `customers_2022 = Broker.Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022. The `YEAR()` function extracts the year from the `join_date` field.

2.  **Calculate Total Customers with Transactions:**
    *   `total_customers_with_transactions = customers_2022.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This line filters the `customers_2022` collection to include only those who have made transactions. The `HAS()` function checks if the `transactions_made` collection is not empty (i.e., the customer has made at least one transaction).

3.  **Calculate Active Customers with Transactions:**
    *   `active_customers_with_transactions = customers_2022.WHERE((HAS(transactions_made) == 1) & (status == 'Active'))`: This line filters the `customers_2022` collection to include only those who are active and have made transactions.

4.  **Partition by Country and Calculate Counts:**
    *   `country_ar = PARTITION(customers_2022, name='cust', by=country).CALCULATE(...)`: This line partitions the `customers_2022` collection by `country`. Inside the `CALCULATE` function:
        *   `country=country`: Selects the country.
        *   `total_customers=COUNT(cust.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`: Counts the total number of customers with transactions in each country.
        *   `active_customers=COUNT(cust.WHERE((HAS(transactions_made) == 1) & (status == 'Active')))`: Counts the number of active customers with transactions in each country.

5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio:**

        *   `country=country`: Selects the country.
        *   `ar=IFF(total_customers > 0, 100.0 * active_customers / total_customers, 0.0)`: Calculates the activity ratio using the formula (Active Customers / Total Customers) \* 100. The `IFF()` function handles the case where the total number of customers is zero to avoid division by zero errors.

2.  **`.WHERE((STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"")) | (ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")))`**: This line filters the customers based on their name.
    *   `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"")`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with ""j"".
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with ""ez"".
    *   `|`: The `|` operator combines the two conditions with a logical OR, so a customer is included if either condition is true.
3.  **`.WHERE(ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), ""a""))`**: This line further filters the customers based on their state.
    *   `LOWER(state)`: Converts the customer's state to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

4.  **`result = GRAPH.CALCULATE(num_customers=COUNT(cust_info))`**: This line calculates the final result.
    *   `COUNT(cust_info)`: Counts the number of customers that satisfy both the name and state conditions.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Calculate Year, Month, Close, and Ticker ID:**
   - The `DailyPrices.CALCULATE` function creates a new collection `monthly_prices` with the year, month, closing price, and ticker ID extracted from the `DailyPrices` collection.

2. **Partition by Ticker, Year, and Month:**
   - The `PARTITION` function groups the `monthly_prices` collection by `ticker_id`, `year`, and `month`.
   - Inside the partition, `AVG(monthly.close)` calculates the average closing price for each ticker in each month.
   - `MAX(monthly.close)` and `MIN(monthly.close)` calculate the highest and lowest prices for each ticker in each month.

3. **Rank by Month:**
   - The `RANKING` function ranks the partitioned data by month within each ticker. This is used to determine the previous month's data for MoMC calculation.

4. **Calculate Lagged Prices:**
   - The `lagged_prices` collection calculates the previous month and average closing price using `IFF` and `WHERE`. If the rank is 1 (first month), the previous month's data is set to `None`. Otherwise, it retrieves the previous month's data using `WHERE` and `SINGULAR`.

5. **Calculate MoMC and Final Result:**
   - The `final_result` collection calculates the month-over-month change (MoMC) using the formula `(avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
   - It also retrieves the ticker symbol from the `Tickers` collection using `ticker.symbol`.
   - The `IFF` function handles the case where there is no previous month (first month), setting MoMC to `None`.

6. **Final Result:**
   - The `result` variable stores the final result, which includes the ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC for each ticker by month.

    *   The `CALCULATE` function selects the `ticker_id`, `date`, `high`, and `low` fields for further processing.

Lowest daily closest price for symbol `VTI` in the past 7 days,"SELECT MIN(sdp.sbDpClose) AS lowest_price FROM sbDailyPrice AS sdp JOIN sbTicker AS st ON sdp.sbDpTickerId = st.sbTickerId WHERE st.sbTickerSymbol = 'VTI' AND sdp.sbDpDate >= date('now', '-7 days');",Broker,"Here's how we can find the lowest daily closing price for the ticker symbol 'VTI' in the past 7 days using PyDough.

**1. Function Selection & Justification:**

*   **WHERE:** To filter `DailyPrices` to only include records for the ticker 'VTI' and within the last 7 days.
*   **MIN:** To find the minimum closing price within the filtered records.
*   **DATEDIFF:** To calculate the difference in days between the current date and the date of the daily price.

**2. Code Generation:**

```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
seven_days_ago = today - datetime.timedelta(days=7)

vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (ticker.symbol == 'VTI') &

)

lowest_closing_price = vti_prices_last_7_days.CALCULATE(
    lowest_close=MIN(close)

```

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

*   First, we calculate the date 7 days ago from today's date using Python's `datetime` module.
*   Then, we filter the `DailyPrices` collection using `WHERE` to select records where the `ticker.symbol` is 'VTI' and the difference in days between the `date` and today's date is less than or equal to 7.
*   Finally, we use `CALCULATE` with the `MIN` aggregation function to find the lowest closing price (`close`) among the filtered records. The result is stored in the `lowest_closing_price` variable.

1.  **Identify the collections needed**: We need the `Users` and `Transactions` collections.
2.  **Determine the filtering condition**: We need to filter users who joined in the past 70 days.
3.  **Determine the aggregation**: We need to count the number of transactions for each user.

Here's the PyDough code:

2.  **Filter recent users**: We filter the `Users` collection to include only users whose `join_date` is within the last 70 days.
3.  **Calculate transaction count**: We use `CALCULATE` to create a new collection `user_transactions` with the `user_id` and the total `transaction_count` for each user. The `transaction_count` is calculated by summing the counts of `transactions_sent` and `transactions_received` for each user.

*   We need to group the payments by week.
*   We need to calculate the total payments and the payments made on weekends for each week.
*   We need to consider only the last 8 completed calendar weeks (excluding the current week).
*   The output should include the week's date, total payments, and weekend payments, sorted by week in ascending order.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `WHERE`: To filter `Sales` records based on `sale_price`.
*   `SUM`: To calculate the total payments and weekend payments.
*   `PARTITION`: To group the payments by week.
*   `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`: To extract date components for filtering and grouping.
*   `DATEDIFF`: To calculate the number of weeks from a reference date.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the results by week.
*   `DATETIME`: To get the start of the week.
*   `ISIN`: To check if a day is a weekend.

**4. Code Explanation**

*   **Reference Date:** A reference date is defined to calculate week numbers consistently.
*   **Sales Filtering:** The code filters `Sales` records where `sale_price` is greater than 30000.
*   **Payments with Week Calculation:** It calculates the week number for each payment based on the `payment_date` using `DATEDIFF` and the weekday.
*   **Last 8 Weeks Filtering:** It filters the payments to include only those within the last 8 weeks.
*   **Partitioning by Week:** The code partitions the payments by `week_number`.
*   **Weekly Aggregation:** Within each week, it calculates the `total_payments` and `weekend_payments`. `KEEP_IF` and `ISIN` are used to filter weekend payments.
*   **Sorting:** Finally, the results are sorted by `week_start` in ascending order.

**5. Verification & Validation**

*   The code addresses all requirements: filtering sales, analyzing payments, grouping by week, calculating total and weekend payments, considering the last 8 weeks, and sorting the output.
*   The use of `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME` ensures accurate week number and date calculations.
*   The `KEEP_IF` and `ISIN` functions correctly identify weekend payments.
*   The code is well-structured and easy to understand.

**1. Analyze the Input**

The request is to retrieve information about salespersons, including their name, total sales, number of sales, and their sales rank. The sales rank needs to be calculated based on the total sales amount in descending order.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `CALCULATE`: To derive new fields like `total_sales_amount` and to select the required fields (`first_name`, `last_name`).
*   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales for each salesperson.
*   `SUM`: To calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson.
*   `RANKING`: To determine the sales rank of each salesperson based on their total sales amount.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To order the final result by sales rank.

**3. Code Generation**

```python
salesperson_info = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    first_name=first_name,
    last_name=last_name,
    total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price),
    number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made),
    SR=RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())
).ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())

```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates the calculation on the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  `first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons.
3.  `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` sub-collection.
4.  `number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales made by each salesperson using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `sales_made` sub-collection.
5.  `SR=RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson based on their total sales amount in descending order. The `RANKING` function assigns ranks based on the `total_sales_amount`.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())`: Orders the result by sales rank in ascending order.

We need to find the highest sale price for each car make and model, but only for cars that are *not* currently in inventory. We need to use the `InventorySnapshots` collection to determine the current inventory status of each car. We'll need to consider the most recent snapshot date for each car. Finally, we need to order the results by the highest sale price in descending order.

Here's the plan:

1.  **Find the latest snapshot date for each car:** We'll use `PARTITION` on `InventorySnapshots` by `car_id` to find the maximum `snapshot_date`.
2.  **Filter inventory snapshots:** We'll filter the `InventorySnapshots` to only include the latest snapshot for each car.
3.  **Identify cars not in inventory:** We'll filter the snapshots to find cars where `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
4.  **Calculate the highest sale price for each make and model:** We'll use `PARTITION` on `Sales` by `car.make` and `car.model` to find the maximum `sale_price`.
5.  **Join the results:** We'll filter the sales records to only include cars that are not in inventory based on the latest snapshot.
6.  **Order the results:** We'll order the final result by the maximum sale price in descending order.

```python
latest_inventory = InventorySnapshots.PARTITION(InventorySnapshots, name='inv_snap', by=car_id).CALCULATE(
    car_id=car_id,
    latest_date=MAX(inv_snap.snapshot_date)
)

)

final_result = sales_info.WHERE(
    (make == not_in_inventory.car.make) & (model == not_in_inventory.car.model)
).ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_inventory`**: This part finds the most recent `snapshot_date` for each `car_id` in the `InventorySnapshots` collection.  It partitions the data by `car_id` and then calculates the maximum `snapshot_date` within each partition.
2.  **`current_inventory`**: This calculates the `car_id`, `snapshot_date`, and `is_in_inventory` from the `InventorySnapshots` collection. It filters the `InventorySnapshots` collection to include only the records where the `car_id` and `snapshot_date` match the `car_id` and `latest_date` from the `latest_inventory` collection. This ensures that we only consider the most recent snapshot for each car.
3.  **`not_in_inventory`**: This filters the `current_inventory` collection to include only the cars that are not in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`).
4.  **`sales_info`**: This partitions the `Sales` collection by `car.make` and `car.model` and calculates the maximum `sale_price` for each group.
5.  **`final_result`**: This filters the `sales_info` collection to include only the cars that are present in the `not_in_inventory` collection. It then orders the result by `highest_sale_price` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection based on the condition specified within the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"") | LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)`: Converts the `make` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` field contains ""ford"" as a substring. The `%` symbols are wildcards, meaning any characters can appear before or after ""ford"".
    *   `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `model` field to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` field contains ""mustang"" as a substring.
    *   `|`: The `|` symbol represents the logical OR operator. So, the `WHERE` clause selects cars where either the `make` contains ""ford"" or the `model` contains ""mustang"".
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates the desired fields for the filtered cars.
    *   `make=make`: Selects the `make` field.
    *   `model=model`: Selects the `model` field.
    *   `year=year`: Selects the `year` field.
    *   `color=color`: Selects the `color` field.
    *   `vin_number=vin_number`: Selects the `vin_number` field.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the average sale price for each car by averaging the `sale_price` from the related `sale_records`.
4.  **`car_sales_info`**: Assigns the resulting collection to the variable `car_sales_info`.

5.  **Generate All Months:**
    *   Creates a list of all months within the last 6 months.
    *   Creates a `GRAPH` collection with all months to ensure all months are returned in the final result, even if there were no sales.

6.  **Left Join and Default Values:**
    *   Performs a left join between the `all_months` collection and the `pmsps_pmsr` collection.
    *   Uses `DEFAULT_TO` to set `PMSPS` and `PMSR` to 0 for months where there were no sales.
    *   Uses `SINGULAR()` to access the values from the `pmsps_pmsr` collection after filtering by month.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Monthly Payments:**
   - The code starts by calculating the `month`, `year`, and `payment_amount` from the `PaymentsReceived` collection. This creates a new collection called `monthly_payments` with these calculated fields.

2. **Partition by Year and Month:**
   - The `monthly_payments` collection is then partitioned by `year` and `month` using the `PARTITION` function. This groups the payments by year and month, creating a partition named ""monthly"".
   - Inside the `CALCULATE` function of the partition, the `SUM` function is used to calculate the `total_payments` for each month.

3. **Order by Year and Month:**
   - The `partitioned_payments` collection is ordered by `year` and `month` in ascending order using the `ORDER_BY` function. This ensures that the months are in chronological order for the MoM calculation.

4. **Calculate MoM Change:**
   - Finally, the `mom_change` collection is created by calculating the MoM change for each month.
   - The `RELSUM` function is used to calculate the sum of the `total_payments` for the previous month. The `levels=1` argument specifies that the sum should be calculated within each year.
   - The MoM change is then calculated by subtracting the previous month's total payments from the current month's total payments.

"What is the TSC in the past 7 days, inclusive of today?TSC = Total Sales Count.","SELECT COUNT(_id) AS TSC FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Dealership,"Here's how we can calculate the total sales count (TSC) for the past 7 days, inclusive of today, using PyDough:

**1. Function Selection & Justification:**

*   **WHERE**: To filter transactions within the last 7 days.
*   **COUNT**: To count the number of transactions (sales).
*   **DATEDIFF**: To calculate the difference in days between the transaction date and the current date.

**2. Code Generation:**

```python

tsc_last_7_days = Broker.Transactions.WHERE(
    DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, today) <= 6
).CALCULATE(
    total_sales_count=COUNT(Transactions)
)
```

**3. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

*   First, we calculate the date 7 days ago using Python's `datetime` module.
*   Then, we use `Broker.Transactions.WHERE` to filter the `Transactions` collection. The `WHERE` clause uses `DATEDIFF` to find transactions where the difference in days between the `date_time` of the transaction and today's date is less than or equal to 6 (inclusive of today).
*   Finally, we use `CALCULATE` with `COUNT(Transactions)` to count the number of transactions that satisfy the date condition. The result is assigned to the variable `tsc_last_7_days`.

1.  **Calculate the total sales amount and number of sales for each salesperson:** We need to group sales by salesperson and calculate the sum of `sale_price` and the count of sales.
2.  **Calculate the ASP for each salesperson:** Divide the total sales amount by the number of sales.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales records from the year 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** Calculate the quarter start date (first day of the quarter) and extract the customer's state.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023:** The first `WHERE` clause filters the `Sales` collection, keeping only the sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is equal to 2023.
2.  **Extract Quarter Start Date and Customer State:** The first `CALCULATE` expression extracts the `customer.state` and calculates the `quarter_start` date by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of the month. The second `CALCULATE` expression calculates the `quarter_start` date by substracting the months of the `quarter_start` date minus one and truncating to the start of the month.
3.  **Partition by State and Quarter:** The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by `customer_state` and `quarter_start`. The name ""sales"" is assigned to each group.
4.  **Calculate Total Sales:** The `CALCULATE` function within the `PARTITION` calculates the `total_sales` by summing the `sale_price` for each group (i.e., for each state and quarter combination). It also selects the `customer_state` as `state` and `quarter_start` as `quarter` for the final output.
5.  **Final Result:** The `quarterly_sales_by_state` variable now holds the result, containing the total sales for each customer state, broken down by quarter.

Here's my plan:

1.  **Filter Treatments by Month:** I'll need to extract the month from the `start_dt` of the treatments and filter for the last three months. Since I don't know the current month, I will calculate the last three months dynamically.
2.  **Count Distinct Patients:** For each of those months, I'll count the distinct number of patients.
3.  **Filter for Biologic Drugs:** I'll filter the treatments to only include those where the drug type is 'biologic'.
4.  **Count Distinct Patients with Biologic Drugs:** For each of the last three months, I'll count the distinct number of patients who received biologic drugs.
5.  **Combine and Return:** Finally, I'll combine the results to return the month, total patient count, and biologic treatment count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Last 3 Months:** The code first calculates the year and month for each of the last three months relative to the current date.
2.  **Extract Treatment Month and Year:** It calculates the `treatment_month` and `treatment_year` from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
3.  **Filter Treatments by Last 3 Months:** It filters the treatments to include only those that occurred in the calculated last three months.
4.  **Partition by Month and Year:** It partitions the filtered treatments by `treatment_year` and `treatment_month` to group treatments by month.
5.  **Count Distinct Patients per Month:** Within each month, it counts the distinct number of patients using `NDISTINCT(treats.patient_id)`.
6.  **Filter Biologic Treatments:** It filters the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the drug type is 'biologic'.
7.  **Repeat Steps 2-5 for Biologic Treatments:** Steps 2-5 are repeated to count the distinct number of patients receiving biologic treatments in each of the last three months.
8.  **Combine Results:** Finally, it combines the results from the total patient count and the biologic treatment count for each month. `DEFAULT_TO` is used to handle cases where there are no biologic treatments in a given month, setting the count to 0.
9.  **Final Calculation:** The final result is calculated, including the month, year, patient count, and biologic treatment count.

)

final_result = ranked_doctors
```

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Calculate Distinct Drug Counts:**
   - The code starts by calculating the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.
   - `DermTreatment.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)` iterates through each doctor in the `Doctors` collection.
   - `doc_id=doc_id` and `specialty=speciality` selects the doctor's ID and specialty.
   - `num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug_id)` counts the number of unique `drug_id` values within the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection for each doctor. This gives the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.
   - The result is stored in the `doc_drug_counts` collection.

2. **Partition by Specialty and Rank:**
   - The code then partitions the `doc_drug_counts` collection by `specialty`.
   - `DermTreatment.PARTITION(doc_drug_counts, name='specialty_group', by=specialty)` groups the doctors by their `specialty`. The partitioned data is accessed using the name `specialty_group`.
   - `CALCULATE(...)` is used to calculate the rank of each doctor within their specialty based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed.
   - `doc_id=specialty_group.doc_id`, `specialty=specialty`, and `num_distinct_drugs=specialty_group.num_distinct_drugs` selects the doctor's ID, specialty, and number of distinct drugs.
   - `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=specialty_group.num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), levels=1)` calculates the rank of each doctor within their specialty. `levels=1` specifies that the ranking should be done within each specialty group. `by=specialty_group.num_distinct_drugs.DESC()` orders the doctors in descending order of the number of distinct drugs prescribed, so doctors prescribing more drugs get a higher rank.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The `final_result` variable stores the `ranked_doctors` collection, which contains the doctor's ID, specialty, number of distinct drugs prescribed, and their rank within their specialty.
","doc_drug_counts = DermTreatment.Doctors.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection based on the specified conditions.
2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), ""j"")`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the `first_name` starts with ""j"". `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching.
3.  **`CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), ""son"")`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the `last_name` contains ""son"". `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching.
4.  **`|`**: This is the OR operator, so the `WHERE` clause selects doctors who satisfy either of the two conditions.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and renames the fields `first_name`, `last_name`, and `speciality` to be included in the final result.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import datetime:** Imports the `datetime` module to get the current date.
2.  **Get Current Date:** Gets the current month and year using `datetime.date.today()`.
3.  **Add Treatment Month:** Creates a new collection `treatments_with_month` by adding a `treatment_month` field to the `Treatments` collection. The `treatment_month` is derived from the `start_dt` field, truncated to the beginning of the month using the `DATETIME` function.
4.  **Partition by Month:** Partitions the `treatments_with_month` collection by `treatment_month`, naming the partition ""monthly\_treatments"".
5.  **Calculate Monthly Data:** Calculates `pmpd` (number of distinct patient IDs) and `pmtc` (total treatment count) for each month within the partition.
6.  **Filter Last 12 Months:** Filters the `monthly_data` to include only months that are before the current month. Orders the result by month in descending order and selects the top 12 months using `TOP_K`.

1.  **Identify New Patients Each Year:** We need to determine which patients started their first treatment in each year. This involves looking at the `Treatments` collection and extracting the year from the `start_dt` field. We'll use `YEAR(start_dt)` to get the year. We'll need to partition by year to count the number of new patients.
2.  **Calculate NPI (New Patients Increase):** To calculate the increase in new patients compared to the previous year, we'll need to calculate the number of new patients for each year and then compare it to the previous year's count. This will likely involve using `LAG` or a similar window function (if available, but it is not). Since it is not available, we will calculate the number of new patients for each year and then use SINGULAR to call every year in the final result.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python

1.  **Calculate new patients per year:**
    *   We filter the `Treatments` collection for each year (1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998) using `WHERE(YEAR(start_dt) == year)`.
    *   For each year, we use `CALCULATE` to extract the year and count the number of new patients (`COUNT(patient_id)`).
2.  **Calculate NPI and final result:**
    *   We use `SINGULAR()` to access the calculated values for each year.
    *   We calculate `NPI` for each year by subtracting the number of new patients in the previous year from the current year.

1.  **Collection**: We need to start with the `Patients` collection.

3.  **Aggregation**: Finally, we need to count the number of patients that satisfy both conditions. We can use the `COUNT` function for this.
4.  **Contextless Expression**: We can define the filters as contextless expressions for better readability.

**1. Analyze the Input**

The question asks for a count of treatments that meet several criteria:

*   **Diagnosis:** The diagnosis name must contain ""psoriasis"" (case-insensitive, wildcard match).
*   **Drug FDA Approval:** The drug used in the treatment must have been FDA-approved.
*   **Treatment End Date:** The treatment must have ended within the last 6 months from today.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `WHERE`: To filter the `Diagnoses`, `Drugs`, and `Treatments` collections based on the specified criteria.
*   `CONTAINS`: To perform a case-insensitive wildcard match for ""psoriasis"" in the diagnosis name.
*   `COUNT`: To count the number of treatments that satisfy all conditions.
*   `DATEDIFF`: To determine if the treatment end date is within the last 6 months.
*   `DATETIME`: To get the current date.

**3. Code Generation**

```python
today = DATETIME('now')
six_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-6 months')

treatment_count = Diagnoses.WHERE(
    CONTAINS(LOWER(diag_name), ""psoriasis"")
).treatments_for.WHERE(
    drug.fda_appr_dt != None
).WHERE(
    (end_dt >= six_months_ago) & (end_dt <= today)
).COUNT()
```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **Define Date Variables:**
    *   `today`: Gets the current date using `DATETIME('now')`.
    *   `six_months_ago`: Calculates the date 6 months ago using `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`.

2.  **Filter Diagnoses:**
    *   `Diagnoses.WHERE(CONTAINS(LOWER(diag_name), ""psoriasis""))`: Filters the `Diagnoses` collection to include only diagnoses where the lowercase version of `diag_name` contains ""psoriasis"".

3.  **Access Treatments and Filter by Drug FDA Approval:**
    *   `.treatments_for.WHERE(drug.fda_appr_dt != None)`: Accesses the `treatments_for` sub-collection (treatments associated with the filtered diagnoses) and filters these treatments to include only those where the associated drug's `fda_appr_dt` is not null.

4.  **Filter by Treatment End Date:**
    *   `.WHERE((end_dt >= six_months_ago) & (end_dt <= today))`: Filters the treatments further to include only those where the `end_dt` falls within the last 6 months (between `six_months_ago` and `today`).

5.  **Count Treatments:**
    *   `.COUNT()`: Counts the number of treatments that satisfy all the specified conditions.

**5. Verification & Validation**

The code addresses all requirements:

*   It filters diagnoses based on a case-insensitive wildcard match for ""psoriasis"".
*   It ensures that the drugs used in the treatments have been FDA-approved (fda\_appr\_dt is not null).
*   It verifies that the treatment end date is within the last 6 months.
*   It returns the count of treatments that meet all criteria.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1.  **Filter Users:** The code starts by filtering the `Users` collection to include only users from the US or Canada using the `WHERE` function and the `|` (OR) operator.
2.  **Calculate Week and Weekend:** A `CALCULATE` function is used to add two new fields to the `notifications` subcollection:
    *   `week`: Extracts the week from the `created_at` timestamp using the `DATETIME` function and truncates to the start of the day.
    *   `is_weekend`: Checks if the notification was sent on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using the `ISIN` function and the `DAY` function.
3.  **Filter Last 3 Weeks:** The code filters the notifications to include only those from the last 3 weeks, excluding the current week.
4.  **Partition by Week:** The `PARTITION` function groups the notifications by the `week` field, creating a collection named `notifications_in_week` for each week.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Summary:** A `CALCULATE` function is used to calculate the following for each week:
    *   `week`: The week itself.
    *   `total_notifications`: The total number of notifications sent during that week using the `COUNT` function.
    *   `weekend_notifications`: The number of notifications sent on weekends during that week using the `SUM` function to sum the `is_weekend` flags.

1.  **Filter for Active Retail Merchants:** We need to filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those that are active and whose category is retail (case-insensitive).
2.  **Filter for Merchants that have issued coupons:** We need to filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those that have issued coupons.
3.  **Count Coupons per Merchant:** For each active retail merchant, we need to count the number of coupons they have issued.

**1. Analyze the Input**

The goal is to determine the most recent balance for each user. This requires accessing the `Users` and `UserBalances` collections and finding the maximum `updated_at` timestamp for each user.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   `PARTITION`: To group the `UserBalances` by `user_id` to find the latest balance for each user.

        *   `MAX(user_bal.updated_at)`: Determines the latest `updated_at` timestamp within the current user's balance records.
        *   `user_bal.WHERE(updated_at == MAX(user_bal.updated_at))`: Filters the `user_bal` collection to include only the balance record(s) with the latest `updated_at` timestamp.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since we are looking for the latest balance, we expect only one record after filtering. This ensures that we are treating the result as a singular value.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Merchant Revenue:**
    *   We start with the `Ewallet.Merchants` collection.
    *   Using `CALCULATE`, we create a new collection with the merchant's `name`, `category`, and the sum of `amount` from successfully received transactions.
    *   The `transactions_received.WHERE(receiver_type == 2, status == ""Completed"").amount` part filters the transactions to include only those where the `receiver_type` is 2 (Merchant) and the `status` is ""Completed"", and then sums the `amount` for these transactions.

2.  **Rank Merchants by Revenue:**
    *   We take the `merchant_revenue` collection from the previous step.
    *   Using `CALCULATE` again, we add a `revenue_rank` field using the `RANKING` function.
    *   `RANKING(by=revenue_amount.DESC())` ranks the merchants based on their `revenue_amount` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

3.  **Select and Rename Fields:**
    *   We take the `merchant_revenue_rank` collection from the previous step.
    *   Using `CALCULATE` again, we select the `merchant_name`, `category`, `revenue_amount`, and `revenue_rank` fields to be included in the final result.

**1. Understanding the Requirements**

*   **PMDAU Definition:** Distinct senders (users) with `sender_type = 1` (representing users, not merchants) for wallet transactions.
*   **Timeframe:** The last two full months, excluding the current month.
*   **Aggregation:** We need to truncate the `created_at` timestamp to the month level for grouping.

**2. Function Selection & Justification**

*   **WHERE:** To filter transactions based on `sender_type = 1` and the desired date range.
*   **MONTH, YEAR:** To extract the month and year from the `created_at` timestamp for filtering.
*   **DATETIME:** To truncate the `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of the month.
*   **PARTITION:** To group transactions by month and year.
*   **COUNT(DISTINCT ...):** To count the distinct users (senders) within each month.

**3. Code Generation**

```python
import datetime

today = datetime.date.today()
current_month = today.month
current_year = today.year

# Calculate the month and year for the last two months

    daily_active_users=NDISTINCT(monthly_tx.sender_id)
)
result = monthly_active_users
```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

*   **Calculate Target Months:** The code first calculates the month and year for the two months preceding the current month. It handles the edge cases where the current month is January or February.
*   **Filter Transactions:**  It filters the `Ewallet.Transactions` collection to include only transactions where `sender_type` is 1 (users) and the transaction occurred in either of the two calculated months.
*   **Partition by Month and Year:** The filtered transactions are then partitioned by month and year using the `PARTITION` function.  This groups the transactions by month.
*   **Calculate Distinct Users:** Within each month, `NDISTINCT(monthly_tx.sender_id)` calculates the number of distinct senders (users) who made transactions.
*   **Assign to Result:** The final result, containing the month, year, and distinct user count for each of the two months, is assigned to the `result` variable.

The request is to calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR) for wallet transactions in the previous month.
STR is defined as (Number of Successful Transactions / Total Number of Transactions).
We need to use the `Transactions` collection.
We need to filter transactions to include only those from the previous month.
We need to count the total number of transactions and the number of successful transactions.
We need to calculate the STR by dividing the number of successful transactions by the total number of transactions.

*   `WHERE`: To filter transactions based on the transaction date and status.
*   `YEAR`: To extract the year from the transaction date.
*   `MONTH`: To extract the month from the transaction date.
*   `COUNT`: To count the total number of transactions and successful transactions.
*   `CALCULATE`: To create new fields (year, month, is\_successful) and calculate the STR.
*   `DATETIME`: To get the current date and time and calculate the previous month.

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **Calculate Previous Month and Year:**
    *   Get the current date using `datetime.date.today()`.
    *   Calculate the first day of the current month.
    *   Subtract one day from the first day of the current month to get the last day of the previous month.
    *   Extract the month and year from the last day of the previous month.

2.  **Filter Transactions for the Previous Month:**
    *   `Ewallet.Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates the year, month, and a flag indicating if the transaction was successful.
        *   `year=YEAR(created_at)`: Extracts the year from the `created_at` timestamp.
        *   `month=MONTH(created_at)`: Extracts the month from the `created_at` timestamp.
        *   `is_successful=IFF(status == ""Completed"", 1, 0)`: Creates a binary flag `is_successful` that is 1 if the transaction `status` is ""Completed"", and 0 otherwise.
    *   `.WHERE((year == previous_year) & (month == previous_month))`: Filters the transactions to include only those from the previous month and year.

3.  **Calculate STR:**
    *   `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates the total number of transactions, the number of successful transactions, and the success rate.
        *   `total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_last_month)`: Counts the total number of transactions in the `transactions_last_month` collection.
        *   `successful_transactions=SUM(transactions_last_month.is_successful)`: Sums the `is_successful` flags to get the number of successful transactions.
        *   `success_rate=100.0 * successful_transactions / total_transactions`: Calculates the success rate as a percentage.

earliest_snapshot = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023).ORDER_BY(snapshot_date.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.ASC()).SINGULAR()

result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    avg_daily_limit=earliest_snapshot.tx_limit_daily,
    avg_monthly_limit=earliest_snapshot.tx_limit_monthly
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`earliest_snapshot = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023).ORDER_BY(snapshot_date.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.ASC()).SINGULAR()`**: This line filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only snapshots from the year 2023. It then orders these snapshots by `snapshot_date` in ascending order and uses `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.ASC())` to select the earliest snapshot. Finally, `.SINGULAR()` is used to convert the collection to a single record.
2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(avg_daily_limit=earliest_snapshot.tx_limit_daily, avg_monthly_limit=earliest_snapshot.tx_limit_monthly)`**: This line calculates the average daily and monthly transaction limits from the `earliest_snapshot`. Since we are only looking at one snapshot, the average will be the same as the values in that snapshot. The result is assigned to the `result` variable.
","earliest_snapshot = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023).ORDER_BY(snapshot_date.ASC()).TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.ASC()).SINGULAR()

result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    avg_daily_limit=earliest_snapshot.tx_limit_daily,
    avg_monthly_limit=earliest_snapshot.tx_limit_monthly

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"Here's how we can calculate the average user session duration in seconds, split by device type using PyDough:

1.  **Calculate Session Duration:** We need to calculate the duration of each user session in seconds. This can be done by subtracting `session_start_ts` from `session_end_ts`.
2.  **Partition by Device Type:** We need to group the sessions by `device_type` to calculate the average duration for each device type.
3.  **Calculate Average Duration:**  For each device type, calculate the average session duration.

```python
session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    device_type=device_type,
    session_duration=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)
)

average_session_duration_by_device = PARTITION(session_durations, name=""sessions"", by=device_type).CALCULATE(
    device_type=device_type,
    average_duration=AVG(sessions.session_duration)
)
```

**Explanation:**

*   **session\_durations**: First, we calculate the session duration for each user session using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` and store it in a new field called `session_duration`. We also select the `device_type` to be used later.
*   **average\_session\_duration\_by\_device**: Then, we use `PARTITION` to group the sessions by `device_type`.  Within each group, we calculate the average session duration using `AVG(sessions.session_duration)`. The result is a collection containing the device type and its average session duration.
","session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    device_type=device_type,

1.  **Find the earliest coupon start date for each merchant:** We'll use `PARTITION` to group coupons by `merchant_id` and then find the minimum `start_date` within each group.
2.  **Calculate the difference between the merchant's registration date and the earliest coupon start date:** We'll use `DATEDIFF` to find the difference in years.
3.  **Filter merchants based on the date difference:** We'll use `WHERE` to select merchants where the date difference is less than or equal to 1 year.
4.  **Select the required fields:** We'll use `CALCULATE` to select the merchant's `_id`, registration date, and the earliest coupon's `_id` and `start_date`.

**Explanation:**

*   **`merchant_coupon_info`**: This collection calculates the earliest coupon start date and id for each merchant.
    *   It starts by selecting the merchant's `mid` and `created_at` from the `Merchants` collection and renaming them to `merchant_id` and `merchant_created_at` respectively.
    *   It then uses `PARTITION` to group the `Coupons` collection by `merchant_id`, naming the group ""merchant\_coupons"".
    *   Within each partition, it calculates the minimum `start_date` (earliest coupon start date) and the `cid` of the coupon with that start date.
*   **`final_result`**: This collection filters the merchants based on the date difference and selects the required fields.
    *   It filters the `merchant_coupon_info` collection to include only merchants where the difference between their registration date and the earliest coupon start date is less than or equal to 1 year, using the `DATEDIFF` function.

1.  **Identify the core task**: Find users who haven't received any notifications within their first year of signing up.

2.  **Collections needed**: We'll need the `Users` and `Notifications` collections.

3.  **Functions**: We'll need `WHERE`, `YEAR`, `DATEDIFF`, `HASNOT`, and `CALCULATE`.

4.  **Strategy**:
    *   First, calculate the date one year after each user's signup date.
    *   Then, filter notifications to only include those within the user's first year.
    *   Finally, find users for whom there are no notifications within their first year.

    *   **`Notifications.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `HASNOT` function, we filter the `Notifications` collection to find notifications that meet the following criteria:
        *   `user_id == uid`: The notification is associated with the current user.
        *   `created_at <= first_year_anniversary`: The notification was created within the user's first year.
