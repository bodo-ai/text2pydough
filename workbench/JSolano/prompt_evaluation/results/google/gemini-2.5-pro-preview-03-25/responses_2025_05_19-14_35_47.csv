```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by selecting the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer who meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"".
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the results (customers with their names and success rates) are ordered by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).",19.217390298843384,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

"How many distinct customers with a .com email address bought stocks of FAANG companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta or Netflix)?Customers with a '.com' email address who bought FAANG stocks (ticker symbol contains 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META' or 'NFLX')",SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t.sbTxCustId) FROM sbTransaction AS t JOIN sbCustomer AS c ON t.sbTxCustId = c.sbCustId JOIN sbTicker AS tk ON t.sbTxTickerId = tk.sbTickerId WHERE c.sbCustEmail LIKE '%.com' AND (tk.sbTickerSymbol LIKE 'AMZN' OR tk.sbTickerSymbol LIKE 'AAPL' OR tk.sbTickerSymbol LIKE 'GOOGL' OR tk.sbTickerSymbol LIKE 'META' OR tk.sbTickerSymbol LIKE 'NFLX');,Broker,"To count the number of distinct customers with a '.com' email address who bought stocks of FAANG companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, or Netflix), we need to perform the following steps:

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    a.  Their `email` address must end with "".com"".
    b.  They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are counting records from the filtered `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single number representing this count, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols for clarity and reusability
faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

# Filter customers who meet the specified criteria
# 1. Email ends with "".com""
# 2. Have at least one transaction involving a FAANG stock
filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(

)

# Calculate the count of these distinct customers at the Broker level
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    distinct_faang_customers_count = COUNT(filtered_customers)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to understand.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition within the `WHERE` clause. It filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the first condition with the second.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions associated with each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols))`: This filters the transactions, keeping only those where the `ticker.symbol` (the symbol of the stock involved in the transaction) is present in the `faang_ticker_symbols` list. The `ISIN` function checks for membership in the provided tuple.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: The `HAS` function checks if the preceding filtered collection (transactions of FAANG stocks for that customer) contains at least one record. If it does, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this context).
6.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(distinct_faang_customers_count = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result at the `Broker` (top-level) scope.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of records in the `filtered_customers` collection. Since `filtered_customers` contains unique customer records that satisfy all conditions, this count represents the number of distinct customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `join_date >= ""2023-01-01""`: This selects customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023.
        *   `status == ""Active""`: This further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result, `filtered_customers`, is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., the TAC).

2.  **`tac_per_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))` groups these customers by the `country` field. Each group in `country_groups` will contain customers from the same country.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `country=country`: This selects the `country` field for the output. Since `country` was a partitioning key, it can be directly referenced.
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the number of customers within each country group. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the records in the `Customers` sub-collection implicitly available for each partition. This gives us the ""Total Active Customers"" count for that specific country.

The final variable `tac_per_country` will contain a list of records, where each record has the `country` and the corresponding `tac_count` (the number of Total Active Customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023).",21.92243456840515,"# Filter customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023, and whose status is 'Active'.

1.  **Establish Current Time Context**: We first calculate the start of the current week (`current_sow_val`) at the graph level. This will serve as a reference point for determining ""weeks ago"".
2.  **Filter and Augment Transactions**:
    *   Access all `Transactions`.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those related to stocks by checking `ticker.ticker_type == ""STOCK""`. (Assuming ""STOCK"" is the string representation for stock types).
    *   For each of these stock transactions, we calculate:
        *   `transaction_dt`: The actual date and time of the transaction.
        *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") for the transaction.
        *   `weeks_ago`: The number of weeks that have passed between the transaction's week and the current week. This is calculated using `DATEDIFF` between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, divided by 7.
3.  **Select Relevant Weeks**: We then filter these augmented transactions to keep only those where `weeks_ago` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive). This selects the 8 full weeks prior to the current week.
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered transactions are then partitioned by `transaction_week_start_dt`. This groups all transactions that occurred in the same week.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts**: For each weekly group (partition):
    *   We output `week_start_date` (which is the `transaction_week_start_dt` partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: We count all transactions within that week's group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: We count transactions within that week's group that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is done by filtering the group's transactions using `Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")))` and then counting them.
6.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

```python
# Define a graph-level calculation to get the start of the current week

result = weekly_stock_transaction_counts
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `graph_context = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining `current_sow_val` which represents the start date of the current week. This is calculated once at the `Broker` (graph) level.
2.  `relevant_transactions_with_week_info = graph_context.Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We access `Transactions` via `graph_context` so that `current_sow_val` is available. Transactions are first filtered to include only those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is ""STOCK"".
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on transactions): For each stock transaction, we derive:
    *   `transaction_dt`: The original transaction timestamp.
    *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week the transaction falls into.
    *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Saturday"").
    *   `weeks_ago`: Calculated by finding the difference in days between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, then dividing by 7. A value of 1 means last week, 2 means the week before last, and so on.
4.  `.WHERE((weeks_ago >= 1) & (weeks_ago <= 8))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that occurred in the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
5.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts = relevant_transactions_with_week_info.PARTITION(...)`: The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `transaction_week_start_dt`. Each partition represents a unique week.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on partitions): For each week's partition:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of that week (the partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific week's partition using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: Counts transactions within the current week's partition where the `day_name` (calculated earlier for each transaction) is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.
7.  `.ORDER_BY(week_start_date.DESC())`: The final result is ordered by the week start date in descending order, showing data for the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

    total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of last week. This is done by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), finding the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and then subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
        *   `_start_of_current_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week, which serves as the exclusive end boundary for last week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` clause builds upon the first one:
        *   It accesses `Customers` from the `Broker` collection.
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")` filters these customers to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made` then accesses all transactions made by these US-based customers.
        *   Another `.WHERE(...)` clause filters these transactions based on their `date_time`:
            *   `date_time >= _start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of last week.
            *   `date_time < _start_of_current_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current week.
        *   The result of this filtering is assigned to a temporary variable `_filtered_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   The third `CALCULATE` clause takes the `_filtered_transactions` collection:
        *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(_filtered_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions that met all the criteria.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these filtered transactions.

The final result, `last_week_transactions_summary`, will be a collection with a single row containing two columns: `number_of_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`, representing the requested data for customers from the USA for transactions made last week.",22.034535884857178,"# Define the start and end dates for ""last week""

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions of type ""buy"" that occurred within the last 10 days from the current date. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  For these filtered transactions, we use `CALCULATE` to extract the `symbol` from the related `ticker` object and assign it to a new field `ticker_sym`. This makes the ticker symbol available for partitioning.
3.  We then `PARTITION` the resulting collection by the `ticker_sym`. This groups all relevant buy transactions by their stock ticker symbol.
4.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Output the `ticker_symbol` (which is the `ticker_sym` partition key).
    *   Count the number of transactions within that group using `COUNT(Transactions)`, naming this count `num_of_buy_transactions`.
5.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_of_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain up to 2 rows, each with the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding `num_of_buy_transactions`.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected customer, we create a standardized 'YYYY-MM' string representing their signup month. This will be used for grouping.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection.
2.  Group the tickers by their `ticker_type` using the `PARTITION` function. This creates distinct groups for each unique ticker type.
3.  For each `ticker_type` group, calculate the average closing price:
    *   Access the `historical_prices` for all tickers within the current `ticker_type` group.
    *   Filter these `historical_prices` to include only records where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') < 7`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the price's `date` and the current moment ('now').
        *   A value of 0 means the price is from today.
        *   A value of 6 means the price is from 7 days ago.
        *   The condition `< 7` includes dates from 0 to 6 days ago.
    *   From these filtered daily prices, take the `close` (closing price).
    *   Compute the `AVG` (average) of these closing prices. This result is the ACP for the specific `ticker_type`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Tickers.PARTITION(name=""ticker_type_group"", by=(ticker_type))`: This part of the query groups all tickers based on their `ticker_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `ticker_type_group`.

1.  **Filter Customers by Join Year**: Select only customers who joined in the year 2022.
2.  **Determine Transaction Status and Activity Status**: For these selected customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), False otherwise.
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's status is 'Active' (`status == 'Active'`), False otherwise.
3.  **Group by Country**: Partition the customers (with their flags) by their `country`.
4.  **Calculate Counts for AR**: For each country group:
    *   `num_active_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022, are 'Active', AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022 AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: Apply the formula: `AR = (num_active_with_transactions / num_total_with_transactions) * 100.0`. If `num_total_with_transactions` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.

    )

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_with_flags`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)` filters these customers to include only those who joined in 2022.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then processes these filtered customers to:
        *   Extract the `country` and assign it to `customer_country`.
        *   Create a boolean flag `has_transactions_flag`, which is true if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
        *   Create a boolean flag `is_active_flag`, which is true if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.

2.  `ar_components_by_country`:
    *   This step takes `customers_joined_2022_with_flags` and partitions them by `customer_country` using `PARTITION(name=""customers_in_country_group"", by=(customer_country))`. Each group, named `customers_in_country_group`, contains customers from the same country who joined in 2022, along with their calculated flags.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(...)` operates on each country group:
        *   `output_country_name = customer_country`: Selects the country name for the group.
        *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who are both active (`is_active_flag` is true) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the numerator for the AR.
        *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the denominator for the AR.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the per-country counts from the previous step.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio.
        *   It checks if `num_total_with_transactions` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.
        *   If it is, AR is calculated as `(num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions`.
        *   Otherwise (if `num_total_with_transactions` is 0), AR is set to `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause is used to filter customers based on specific criteria.

2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with the letter 'j'.

3.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with the substring 'ez'.

4.  **`(STARTSWITH(...) | ENDSWITH(...))`**:
    *   The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions. A customer is selected if their name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez' (case-insensitively).

5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**:
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the customer's `state` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state ends with the letter 'a'.

6.  **`(...name_condition...) & (...state_condition...)`**:
    *   The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition group with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria.

7.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of customers that remained after applying the `WHERE` clause filters.
    *   The result is assigned to a new field `number_of_matching_customers`.",13.332395553588867,"filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and create a working version with aliased fields for clarity, including the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), transaction date/time, type, amount, tax, and commission.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions within the specified date range. ""Past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" is interpreted as the period from the start of the calendar month that was one month ago, up to the current date and time. For example, if today is July 15th, this range would be from June 1st to July 15th. This is achieved using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month', 'start of month')` for the start date and `DATETIME('now')` for the end date.
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: Partition the filtered sell transactions by their ticker symbol. This allows us to perform aggregations for each ticker.
4.  **Aggregate Financials per Ticker**: For each ticker group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_sell_amount` by summing the `amount` of sell transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_tax` by summing the `tax` associated with these transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_commission` by summing the `commission` for these transactions.
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values for each ticker, calculate the SPM with the provided formula:
    `SPM = (Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`
    This translates to:
    `SPM = (total_sell_amount - (total_tax + total_commission)) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`
    We will handle cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to 0.0 in such instances.
6.  **Format Output**: Select and return only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM` for each ticker.

1.  **Initial Data Preparation**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, we extract the ticker symbol from the related `Tickers` collection, the year, the month number (1-12), and create a formatted month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). We also carry forward the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Monthly Aggregation**: We partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and by each month (using year, month number, and the formatted month string as keys). For each resulting group (i.e., for each ticker for each month), we calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price using the respective aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) on the original daily prices that fall into that group.
3.  **MoMC Calculation**:
    *   The results from step 2 (monthly aggregates per ticker) are then partitioned again, this time only by ticker symbol. This gives us a series of monthly data for each ticker.
    *   Within each ticker's series of monthly data, we use the `PREV` window function to find the average closing price of the *previous* month. This function requires the data to be ordered by year and month number.
    *   Finally, using the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price (obtained via `PREV`), we calculate the MoMC. The formula is: `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`. We handle cases where the previous month's data is unavailable or its average closing price is zero by setting MoMC to `None`.

The final output will include the ticker symbol, the formatted month, the calculated average closing price, highest price, lowest price for that month, and the MoMC.

    *   Crucially, it fetches the stock symbol (`ticker.symbol`) from the related `Tickers` table and names it `stock_symbol_value`. This performs an implicit join.

2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the records generated in the previous step to include only those where `price_date` falls between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023, inclusive.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""stock_group"", by=(stock_symbol_value))`**:
    *   The filtered records are then partitioned (grouped) by `stock_symbol_value`. This ensures that calculations are done for each distinct stock symbol.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first instance after PARTITION)**:
    *   For each group (i.e., for each distinct stock symbol):
        *   `final_ticker_symbol=stock_symbol_value`: The stock symbol (which is the partition key) is carried forward.
        *   `max_high_in_range=MAX(price_high)`: Calculates the highest price (`price_high`) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
        *   `min_low_in_range=MIN(price_low)`: Calculates the lowest price (`price_low`) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   The `MAX` and `MIN` functions operate on all `price_high` and `price_low` values for the current stock symbol within the specified date range, giving the overall high and low for that period.

5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second instance after PARTITION)**:
    *   This step takes the output from the previous `CALCULATE` (which has one record per stock symbol with its max high and min low).
    *   `price_change_value=max_high_in_range - min_low_in_range`: Calculates the difference between the maximum high and minimum low for each stock, representing the total price change over the period.

Explanation:
1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation on the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_id=_id, c_name=name`: We select the customer's `_id` and `name`, assigning them to temporary variables `c_id` and `c_name` to avoid potential naming conflicts and for clarity in the final selection.
    *   `txn_count_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same calendar month and year as their `join_date`.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for the current customer.
        *   `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))`: This condition ensures that the year of the transaction matches the year of the customer's `join_date`, AND the month of the transaction matches the month of the customer's `join_date`.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: This aggregation function counts the number of transactions that satisfy the `WHERE` condition.
2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=txn_count_join_month.DESC())`: After calculating `txn_count_join_month` for all customers, this operation selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `txn_count_join_month`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the highest count is ranked first.
3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=c_id, name=c_name, number_of_transactions=txn_count_join_month)`: This final `CALCULATE` step formats the output to include the customer's original `_id` (from `c_id`), `name` (from `c_name`), and the calculated count, renaming `txn_count_join_month` to `number_of_transactions` as per the request.",35.10426211357117,"result = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions by Date:**
    *   The code starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It applies a `WHERE` clause to filter transactions that occurred between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, inclusive.
    *   `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"")` is used for the inclusive start date (January 1, 2023, 00:00:00).
    *   `DATETIME(""2023-04-01"")` is used for the exclusive end date, effectively including all transactions up to March 31, 2023, 23:59:59.

2.  **Group by Transaction Type and Calculate Metrics:**
    *   The `filtered_transactions` are then partitioned by `transaction_type` using `PARTITION(name=""txn_type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))`. This groups all transactions of the same type together.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), a `CALCULATE` operation is performed to compute:
        *   `transaction_type`: The transaction type itself (from the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_customers`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`, which counts distinct `customer_id` values within the current transaction type group.
        *   `average_shares`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type. This is calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`, which averages the `shares` values within the current transaction type group.

3.  **Select Top 3 Transaction Types:**
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` is applied to the `transaction_type_summary`.
    *   This selects the top 3 transaction types based on the `num_distinct_customers` field, sorted in descending order.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection, as each entry in this collection represents a unique customer.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction of type 'buy'. We can use the `HAS` function to check the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
    *   Inside `HAS`, we filter `transactions_made` for records where `transaction_type == 'buy'`.
3.  For the customers who meet this criterion, select their `_id` field, which is the customer's unique identifier.
4.  Rename the `_id` field to `customer_id` in the output as requested.

This approach ensures distinctness because we are iterating over the `Customers` collection, and each customer appears only once.

2.  Filter these records using a `WHERE` clause to include only those where the `date` is greater than or equal to '2023-04-01'.
3.  To get a distinct list of `ticker_id`s from the filtered records, we will use the `PARTITION` function, grouping by `ticker_id`.
4.  Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select the `ticker_id` from each partition, effectively giving us the distinct list.

*   `.PARTITION(name=""unique_ticker_entries"", by=(ticker_id))`: After filtering, this partitions the remaining `DailyPrices` records based on their `ticker_id`. This grouping ensures that we can operate on unique `ticker_id`s.
*   `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`: This final step selects the `ticker_id` from each partition.

2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(historical_prices) == 1)`**: This filters the `Tickers` collection.

    *   `HASNOT(historical_prices)` returns `True` if the `historical_prices` sub-collection is empty for a given ticker, and `False` otherwise.
    *   `== 1` is used because `HASNOT` (like `HAS`) returns a boolean-like value (0 or 1) in PyDough, where 1 represents True.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id, ticker_symbol=symbol)`**: For the tickers that satisfy the `WHERE` condition (i.e., have no daily prices), this step selects and renames the desired fields:

Explanation:
1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We first process the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields: `cust_state` (derived from `transaction.customer.state`) and `tick_type` (derived from `transaction.ticker.ticker_type`).
2.  `state_ticker_combinations = transaction_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transaction_details` collection.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**:
    *   This part of the query starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` function to group the customers based on their `country`. Each group is internally named `country_groups` (though this internal name is not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for accessing partition keys).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(country_name=country, num_customers=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   After partitioning, `CALCULATE` is applied to each group (each country).
    *   `country_name=country`: This selects the `country` field (which was used as a partitioning key) and renames it to `country_name` in the output.
    *   `num_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the total number of customers within each country group and names this new field `num_customers`. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the customer records within the current partition (i.e., for each specific country).

3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=num_customers.DESC())`**:
    *   This function takes the collection of countries (each with its `country_name` and `num_customers`) produced by the previous step.
    *   It selects the top 5 records based on the `num_customers` field.
    *   `num_customers.DESC()`: Specifies that the sorting should be in descending order, so countries with the highest number of customers appear first.

The final `result` will be a collection containing the top 5 countries, with each record having two fields: `country_name` (the name of the country) and `num_customers` (the total number of customers in that country).",19.92138910293579,"result = Customers.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions that occurred within the last 30 days. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current moment (`'now'`).
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `c_country`: The country of the customer who made the transaction, accessed via `customer.country`.
    *   `t_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
    This results in a temporary collection named `transactions_details`.
3.  We then partition the `transactions_details` collection by `c_country`. This groups all transactions by the customer's country.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country (which is `c_country`).
    *   `num_transactions`: The total number of transactions for that country within the last 30 days. This is achieved by `COUNT(transactions_details)`, which counts the records in the `transactions_details` collection that fall into the current country partition.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all transaction amounts for that country within the last 30 days. This is achieved by `SUM(transactions_details.t_amount)`, summing the `t_amount` field from the `transactions_details` records in the current country partition.
5.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 5 countries with the highest `total_transaction_amount`. The results will include the `country_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount` for these top 5 countries.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`vti_prices_in_range = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This line defines a contextless expression named `vti_prices_in_range`.
    *   It starts with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records based on two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This ensures that only records for the ticker symbol 'VTI' are considered. It accesses the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` entity.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters records for the ""past 7 days"".
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` means we include records where the difference is 0 (today), 1 (yesterday), ..., up to 6 (6 days ago). This covers a total span of 7 calendar days.

2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result using the top-level `Broker` collection (representing the entire graph/database).
    *   `CALCULATE(lowest_daily_close_price_vti_past_7_days=MIN(vti_prices_in_range.close))`:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, we use `CALCULATE` to compute a new field `num_sell_transactions`.
    *   `num_sell_transactions` is determined by counting records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which lists all transactions for that customer).
    *   The `transactions_made` are filtered using `WHERE` to include only those that:
        *   Have `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
        *   Occurred on the date ""2023-04-01"". This is checked by comparing the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` of the `date_time` field.
    *   We also select the customer's `_id` (as `customer_identifier`) and `name` (as `customer_name_val`) to carry them forward for the final output.

2.  **`top_customer_by_transactions = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `customer_transaction_counts` collection (which now includes each customer and their count of relevant transactions).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_sell_transactions.DESC())` selects the single customer (`k=1`) who has the highest `num_sell_transactions`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

3.  **`result = top_customer_by_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   From the single customer record returned by `TOP_K`, we use `CALCULATE` again to format the final output.
    *   It selects the customer's original `_id` (from `customer_identifier`), `name` (from `customer_name_val`), and renames `num_sell_transactions` to `number_of_transactions` to match the requested output field name.",38.57241654396057,"# Calculate the number of ""sell"" transactions on 2023-04-01 for each customer.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with a `status` of ""successful"".
2.  From these successful transactions, calculate the `year` and `month` of the `date_time`. We also need to carry forward the `price` for aggregation.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This selects only transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each successful transaction:
    *   `transaction_year = YEAR(date_time)`: Extracts the year from the `date_time` field.
    *   `transaction_month = MONTH(date_time)`: Extracts the month from the `date_time` field.
    *   `price = price`: Ensures the original `price` field is available for later aggregation.
3.  `.WHERE((transaction_year == 2023) & ISIN(transaction_month, (1, 2, 3)))`: This filters the records to include only those from January (1), February (2), or March (3) of the year 2023, effectively selecting the 1st quarter of 2023. The resulting collection is named `transactions_q1_2023_successful`.
4.  `transactions_q1_2023_successful.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered transactions by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`. Each group is named `monthly_group`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the original `Transactions` items that fall into the current partition.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by year in ascending order, and then by month in ascending order.

1.  Define a condition to filter sales within the last 30 days. This involves comparing the `sale_date` of each sale with the current date. We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` to represent today's date at midnight, ensuring consistent day-based comparisons. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now', 'start of day'))` calculates the number of full days between the sale date and today.
    *   A sale is within the last 30 days (inclusive of today) if this difference is between 0 (sale happened today) and 29 (sale happened 29 full days ago, making it the 30th day in the window).
2.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  For each salesperson, use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select their `_id` (as `salesperson_id`), `first_name` (as `s_first_name`), and `last_name` (as `s_last_name`).
    *   Count the number of sales in their `sales_made` sub-collection that satisfy the date condition defined in step 1. This count is named `num_sales_last_30_days`.

**Explanation:**

*   The query starts by defining `sales_in_last_30_days_condition`. This is a boolean expression that checks if a `sale_date` falls within the desired 30-day window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` gets the current date at midnight. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now', 'start of day'))` calculates the difference in days. The condition `(>= 0) & (<= 29)` ensures we include sales from today up to 29 days prior, covering a total of 30 days.

*   Inside `CALCULATE`:

    *   `num_sales_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sales_in_last_30_days_condition))` counts the sales for the current salesperson. It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection, filters these sales using the `sales_in_last_30_days_condition`, and then counts the remaining records.

```

**Explanation:**

*   First, we create `cars_data_prepared` from the `Cars` collection. In this step, we add new fields `processed_make`, `processed_model`, and `processed_vin`, which are lowercase versions of the original `make`, `model`, and `vin_number` fields. This is done to ensure that filtering and grouping operations are case-insensitive as requested.
*   Next, `filtered_cars_by_vin` selects cars from `cars_data_prepared` where the `processed_vin` (lowercase VIN) contains 'm5'. The `LIKE` operator with `'%m5%'` ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' anywhere in the VIN.
*   Finally, `result` is obtained by partitioning `filtered_cars_by_vin`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(processed_make, processed_model))` groups the cars by unique combinations of their lowercase make and model.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operation is performed for each of these groups.
        *   `make=processed_make` and `model=processed_model` select the lowercase make and model for the output, reflecting the case-insensitive grouping.
        *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)` calculates the total number of sales for all cars within the current (make, model) group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the collection of all sale records associated with the cars in that specific partition group. The `COUNT` function then sums up these sales.",44.336103439331055,"# Step 1: Prepare car data by converting relevant fields to lowercase for case-insensitive operations.
cars_data_prepared = Cars.CALCULATE(

    processed_make=LOWER(make),
    processed_model=LOWER(model),
    processed_vin=LOWER(vin_number)
)

# Step 2: Filter cars where the lowercase VIN contains 'm5'.
# The LIKE operator with '%' wildcards allows for partial matching.
filtered_cars_by_vin = cars_data_prepared.WHERE(

How many Toyota cars were sold in the last 30 days inclusive of today? Return the number of sales and total revenue.,"SELECT COUNT(s._id) AS num_sales, SUM(s.sale_price) AS total_revenue FROM sales AS s JOIN cars AS c ON s.car_id = c._id WHERE c.make = 'Toyota' AND s.sale_date BETWEEN DATE('now', '-30 days') AND DATE('now');",Dealership,"To determine the number of Toyota cars sold in the last 30 days (inclusive of today) and their total revenue, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
2.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`. This condition means the difference between the `sale_date` and today is 29 days or less (0 days means today, 29 days means 29 days ago, covering a 30-day period).
3.  Use the top-level `Dealership` collection to calculate the count of these filtered sales and the sum of their `sale_price`.

```python

recent_toyota_sales_filtered = Sales.WHERE(

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_toyota_sales_filtered = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line creates a temporary collection of sales records.
    *   `Sales.car.make == ""Toyota""`: This condition filters sales to include only those where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", Sales.sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This condition filters sales based on their `sale_date`.
        *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", Sales.sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
        *   `<= 29` ensures that we include sales from today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago, covering a total of 30 days.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only sales meeting both criteria are included.

2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This line performs the final aggregation at the `Dealership` (top graph) level.
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales_filtered)`: This calculates the total number of sales records present in the `recent_toyota_sales_filtered` collection.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales_filtered.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in the `recent_toyota_sales_filtered` collection, giving the total revenue.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  Calculate the total sales amount and the number of sales for each salesperson. The total sales amount is the sum of `sale_price` from their `sales_made` records, and the number of sales is the count of their `sales_made` records. These will be stored in temporary fields.
3.  In a subsequent step, calculate the Sales Rank (SR) using the `RANKING` function based on the previously calculated total sales amount, in descending order. At this step, we will also rename the temporary fields to the final desired output names.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `temp_first_name=first_name`, `temp_last_name=last_name`: We select the salesperson's first and last names, storing them in temporary variables.
    *   `temp_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: For each salesperson, we calculate the sum of `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (accessed via the `sales_made` sub-collection). This gives the total sales amount for that salesperson.
    *   `temp_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: We count the number of sales records in `sales_made` for each salesperson to get their total number of sales.

2.  `sales_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`: We take the result from the first `CALCULATE` step (which now includes `temp_first_name`, `temp_last_name`, `temp_total_sales`, and `temp_num_sales` for each salesperson).

2.  For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the associated car, and the `sale_price`.
3.  Crucially, for each car involved in a sale, we determine its latest inventory status. This is done by:

    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to select this single latest snapshot.
    *   Retrieving the `is_in_inventory` status from this latest snapshot.
4.  We then filter these sales records, keeping only those where the car's `is_car_in_inventory_latest` status is `False`, indicating the car is no longer in inventory.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  **Define Date Range**: The period of interest is the last six full calendar months prior to the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `six_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month that was six months before the current month.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**: Include salespersons hired in the years 2022 or 2023, inclusive.

3.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales made by these filtered salespersons that fall within the defined date range.

4.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each relevant sale, determine its month (e.g., by truncating `sale_date` to the start of the month). This `sale_month_start_val` will be used for grouping.

5.  **Aggregate Metrics**:
    *   Group the prepared sales data by `sale_month_start_val`.
    *   For each month group:
        *   `PMSPS`: Count the number of sales.
        *   `PMSR`: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `current_month_start_dt` and `six_months_ago_start_dt` define the 6-month period for sales analysis (e.g., if it's July, this covers January to June).
2.  `selected_salespersons` filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those hired in 2022 or 2023.
3.  `relevant_sales_from_selected_persons` accesses the `sales_made` for these salespersons and further filters these sales to include only those occurring within the defined 6-month window.
4.  `sales_data_with_month_start` augments each relevant sale record with `sale_month_start_val`, which is the first day of the month in which the sale occurred. This is used for grouping. The original `sale_price` field is carried over.
5.  `monthly_sales_metrics` performs the main aggregation:
    *   It partitions the `sales_data_with_month_start` by `sale_month_start_val`.
    *   For each month group, it calculates:
        *   `month`: The start date of the month (from `sale_month_start_val`).
        *   `PMSPS`: The total count of sales in that month for the selected salespersons, obtained by `COUNT(sales_data_with_month_start)`.
        *   `PMSR`: The total sales revenue in that month, obtained by `SUM(sales_data_with_month_start.sale_price)`.
    *   Finally, it orders the results by `month` in ascending order.

This query will produce one row for each month in the specified period that had at least one sale meeting the criteria.

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We access the `Sales` collection.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures only sales from the year 2023 are considered.
    - `(MONTH(sale_date) >= 1) & (MONTH(sale_date) <= 3)` ensures only sales from January, February, or March are included.

1.  For each payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection, calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` of its associated sale (accessed via `sale_record.sale_date`) and its own `payment_date`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF` function.
2.  Compute the average of these calculated day differences across all payment records. This is achieved using the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  Round the final average value to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.
4.  The calculation is performed at the `Dealership` graph level to produce a single aggregated result.

```python
avg_days_sale_to_payment = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    average_days_to_payment=ROUND(
        AVG(
            PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(

```
**Explanation:**

*   `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`: This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, it calculates `days_difference` as the number of days between the `sale_date` (from the linked `Sales` record via `sale_record`) and the `payment_date` of the current payment.
*   `.days_difference`: This accesses the collection of `days_difference` values calculated in the previous step.
*   `AVG(...)`: This function takes all the `days_difference` values and computes their average.
*   `ROUND(..., 2)`: The calculated average is then rounded to 2 decimal places.
*   `Dealership.CALCULATE(average_days_to_payment=...)`: This performs the overall aggregation at the top level of the `Dealership` graph, assigning the final rounded average to the field `average_days_to_payment`.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: `GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023**: We'll start by accessing the `Sales` collection and filtering for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **Calculate Total Revenue**: For these 2023 sales, the total revenue is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  **Calculate Total Cost**: For the cars sold in 2023, the total cost is the sum of the `cost` of each car. The cost of the car is accessed via the `car` relationship from a `Sale` record (i.e., `Sales.car.cost`).
4.  **Apply GPM Formula**: Using the calculated total revenue and total cost, we apply the GPM formula. This calculation is done at the `Dealership` level to produce a single GPM value for all relevant sales.
5.  **Structure**: We use a `CALCULATE` clause on the `Dealership` collection to compute `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023`. A subsequent `CALCULATE` clause is used to compute the `gpm_value` based on these intermediate results.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from all sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of all cars sold in 2023
    total_cost_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    # The result will be a single GPM value for the year 2023.
    gpm_value = (total_revenue_for_2023 - total_cost_for_2023) / total_cost_for_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following steps:

1.  It starts at the `Dealership` level, which is the top-level collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` clause computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023`: This is the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records in the `Sales` collection where the year of `sale_date` is 2023.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023`: This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales records in 2023. It accesses the car's cost via `Sales.car.cost`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause uses the `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023` values (calculated in the previous step) to compute the `gpm_value` according to the provided formula.
4.  The final result, `gpm_calculation`, will be a collection containing a single row with one column: `gpm_value`, representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",32.77684211730957,"gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to find those where the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`) has an inventory record in `InventorySnapshots` showing it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the same date as the sale (`InventorySnapshots.snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`). We use the `HAS` function to check for the existence of such an inventory snapshot.
3.  From this filtered list of sales, identify the one with the highest `sale_price` using the `TOP_K` function.
4.  For this top sale, extract the car's `make`, `model` (from `Sales.car.make` and `Sales.car.model`), and the `sale_price`.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`:
    *   We start by querying the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1` checks if for each sale, its associated car (`car`) has at least one record in its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that meets the specified criteria.
    *   The inner `WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))` filters the `inventory_snapshots`.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False` ensures the snapshot records when the car went out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date` ensures this happened on the same day as the `sale_date` of the current `Sales` record.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the filtered sales (those that occurred on the day the car went out of inventory).
    *   It selects the top 1 sale, ordered by `sale_price` in descending order (`DESC()`), effectively finding the sale with the highest price.

3.  `.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`:

2.  Group these records by year and month using `PARTITION`. For each group (each month), calculate the sum of `payment_amount` to get the total payments for that month.
3.  Order these monthly totals chronologically by year and then by month. This ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the previous month's data.
4.  Use the `PREV` window function to retrieve the `total_monthly_payments` from the previous month. We set a `default=0.0` for cases where there is no preceding month in the data (e.g., the very first month in the dataset), ensuring the MoM calculation is `current_month_total - 0.0`.
5.  Calculate the MoM change as `(current_month_total_payments - previous_month_total_payments)`.
6.  Select the final fields: year, month, total payments received for the month, and the calculated MoM change.
7.  The query will list all months that have payment data. If a calendar month has no payments, it will not appear in the results. The MoM calculation correctly handles scenarios where a month has payments, but its immediately preceding calendar month had no payments (and thus is not in the dataset), by using the `default=0.0` for the previous month's total.

"What is the TSC in the past 7 days, inclusive of today?TSC = Total Sales Count.","SELECT COUNT(_id) AS TSC FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Dealership,"To calculate the Total Sales Count (TSC) for the past 7 days, inclusive of today, we need to:
1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days (i.e., from 6 days ago up to and including today).
    We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of full days between `sale_date` and the current moment.
    - If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    - If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.
    - If `sale_date` is in the future, the difference will be negative.
    So, the condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` will select sales from today and the preceding 6 days.
3.  Count these filtered sales records.

)
```
Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because the query asks for a single aggregated value (Total Sales Count).
- `Dealership.Sales` accesses all sales records.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
    - `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    - `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0)` ensures that we only consider sales that happened on or before today (not in the future).
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` ensures that the sales happened within the last 6 days from today (e.g., if today is the 7th, this includes sales from the 1st to the 7th).
    - Combining these with `&` gives us sales from the 7-day period ending today.
- `COUNT(...)` then counts the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.
- The result is assigned to `TSC` in the `CALCULATE` clause.",26.21731734275818,"total_sales_count_last_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `temp_id = _id`: The salesperson's ID.
    *   `temp_first_name = first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
    *   `temp_last_name = last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
    *   `temp_total_sales = SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: The total sales amount for the salesperson. `sales_made` is a sub-collection of sales records linked to the salesperson, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `SUM()` aggregates these prices.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Sorts the salespersons by `temp_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that if any salesperson has a NULL total sales amount, they are placed at the end of the sorted list (and thus are unlikely to be in the top 5).

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step selects the required fields and renames them as per the request for the output.
    *   `ID = temp_id`
    *   `first_name = temp_first_name`

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=(state))`**:

2.  **`.CALCULATE(state_name=state, total_signups=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   For each group (i.e., for each unique state) created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `state_name=state`: We select the `state` (and rename it to `state_name` for clarity in the output, though just `state` would also work if preferred).

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` and `end_period_date = DATETIME('now')`: These lines define the time window for our analysis. `start_period_date` is set to exactly three months before the current date/time, and `end_period_date` is the current date/time.
2.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  `sales_in_defined_period = sales_made.WHERE((sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date <= end_period_date))`: In the first `CALCULATE`, for each salesperson, we create a temporary sub-collection `sales_in_defined_period`. This sub-collection contains only the sales from `sales_made` where the `sale_date` falls within our defined 3-month window.
4.  The second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `first_name = first_name, last_name = last_name`: We select the salesperson's first and last names.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_defined_period.sale_price)`: We calculate the `total_revenue` for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of all sales in their `sales_in_defined_period` sub-collection. This aligns with the provided definition of revenue.
    *   `total_sales = COUNT(sales_in_defined_period)`: We count the number of sales in `sales_in_defined_period` to get the `total_sales` for each salesperson.
5.  `.WHERE(total_sales > 0)`: This filters out salespersons who had no sales during the specified 3-month period. This ensures that `TOP_K` operates on relevant data and avoids potential issues with zero or null revenues if those salespersons were not filtered.
6.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, we select the top 3 salespersons based on their `total_revenue`, with the highest revenue ranked first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `salespersons_employment_info = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to create a new set of fields for each salesperson:
        *   `s_first_name`: Stores the salesperson's `first_name`.
        *   `s_last_name`: Stores the salesperson's `last_name`.
        *   `s_phone`: Stores the salesperson's `phone` number.
        *   `employment_duration_days`: Calculates the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`. If `termination_date` is null (meaning the salesperson is still employed), this duration is expected to be null.

2.  `shortest_employed_salesperson = salespersons_employment_info.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `salespersons_employment_info` collection.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`: This function selects the top 1 salesperson. The selection is ordered by `employment_duration_days` in ascending order (`ASC()`). Crucially, if `employment_duration_days` is null (e.g., for salespersons not yet terminated), `ASC()` places these nulls at the end of the sort order by default. This ensures that the ""top 1"" will be the salesperson with the smallest actual (non-null) employment duration.
    *   `.CALCULATE(first_name=s_first_name, last_name=s_last_name, phone=s_phone, days_employed=employment_duration_days)`: After selecting the salesperson with the shortest employment, this `CALCULATE` clause formats the output to include:

3.  Further filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` falls on a weekend. I'll use the `DAYNAME()` function to get the name of the day and check if it is 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.
4.  Finally, I will count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.

This code:
1.  Starts by creating a calculation at the `Dealership` level because we need a single aggregated value.
2.  Accesses the `PaymentsMade` collection.
3.  Applies a `WHERE` clause to filter the payments:
    *   It checks if `vendor_name` is equal to 'Utility Company'.
    *   It uses the `DAYNAME()` function on `payment_date` to get the name of the day.
    *   It uses `ISIN()` to check if the day name is either 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.
    *   Both conditions must be true (using `&`).
4.  Uses `COUNT()` to count the number of payments that meet these criteria.

1.  **Define the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week runs from Monday to Sunday.
    *   We first determine the start of the current week. Assuming `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week (which is consistent with ISO week conventions).
    *   The previous ISO week's Monday (`prev_week_start_dt`) is then 7 days before the start of the current week.
    *   The previous ISO week's Sunday (`prev_week_end_dt`) is 1 day before the start of the current week.
    *   These dates are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level) collection.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `prev_week_start_dt` and `prev_week_end_dt` (inclusive).

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For each filtered payment, we extract the day part of the `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` to ensure aggregation is done on a daily basis. This will be `pay_day_key`.
    *   The `payment_method` will be `pay_method_key`.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   The prepared payment data is then partitioned by `pay_day_key` and `pay_method_key`. This creates groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   For each group, we calculate the sum of `payment_amount` using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.

5.  **Output**:
    *   The result will show the payment day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

For example, if a sale is in February 2023 (Q1), its `q_repr_date` will be ""2023-01-01"". If a sale is in May 2023 (Q2), its `q_repr_date` will be ""2023-04-01"".
3.  Group (partition) the processed sales records by the customer's state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter representation date (`q_repr_date`).
4.  For each group (i.e., for each unique combination of state and quarter start date), calculate the sum of `s_price` to get the `total_sales`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_data_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`:
    This line filters the `Sales` collection to retain only records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.

2.  `sales_data_with_quarter = sales_data_2023.CALCULATE(...)`:
    This step processes each sale from 2023 to derive necessary fields for grouping and aggregation:
    *   `c_state = customer.state`: Extracts the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `s_price = sale_price`: Stores the `sale_price` for later summation.
    *   `quarter_start_month_num = IFF(...)`: Determines the first month number of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, 7 for Jul-Sep, 10 for Oct-Dec) based on the month of the `sale_date`.
    *   `sale_year_start_date = DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of year')`: Calculates the first day of the year for the `sale_date` (e.g., ""2023-01-01"").
    *   `q_repr_date = DATETIME(sale_year_start_date, '+' + STRING(quarter_start_month_num - 1) + ' months')`: Constructs the first date of the quarter. It takes the `sale_year_start_date` and adds the appropriate number of months (0 for Q1, 3 for Q2, 6 for Q3, 9 for Q4) to arrive at dates like ""2023-01-01"", ""2023-04-01"", ""2023-07-01"", or ""2023-10-01"".

3.  `result = sales_data_with_quarter.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_sales_group"", by=(c_state, q_repr_date))`: Groups the records from `sales_data_with_quarter` based on unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the quarter representation date (`q_repr_date`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state = c_state, quarter = q_repr_date, total_sales = SUM(s_price))`: For each group created by the partition, this calculates the final output:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: The customer's state for the group.
        *   `quarter = q_repr_date`: The first date of the quarter, representing the quarter.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection and aims to calculate new fields for each drug.
    *   **`drug_name_val=drug_name`**: Selects the name of the drug and assigns it to `drug_name_val`.
    *   **`avg_ddd_val=AVG(...)`**: Calculates the average Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each drug. This is an aggregation.

2.  **`treatments_used_in`**: For each drug, it accesses the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which lists all treatments where this drug was used.

3.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments:
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`**: Calculates the duration of the treatment in days. It ensures this duration is positive to avoid division by zero or negative duration when calculating DDD, which would be meaningless for ""total days of treatment"".

4.  **`.CALCULATE(ddd_per_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment:
    *   It calculates the individual DDD for that specific treatment.
    *   **`ddd_per_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`**: This is the core DDD formula: total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) divided by the total days of treatment (calculated as the difference between `end_dt` and `start_dt` in days).

5.  **`.ddd_per_treatment`**: After calculating `ddd_per_treatment` for each valid treatment, this expression makes the calculated DDD value available for the outer `AVG` function.

6.  **`AVG(...)`**: The `AVG` function then computes the average of all `ddd_per_treatment` values for the current drug, yielding the `avg_ddd_val`.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name_val` and its corresponding `avg_ddd_val`.

1.  **Augment Treatment Data**: For each treatment, we'll calculate two helper fields:
    *   `calc_treatment_month_start_date`: The first day of the month in which the treatment started. This will be used for date-based filtering.
    *   `calc_month_label`: A string representation of the treatment's month and year (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). This will be used for grouping and as the output month identifier.

2.  **Filter for Relevant Period**: We'll define the time window as the last three full months, excluding the current month. Treatments falling within this window will be selected using `calc_treatment_month_start_date`.
    *   The start of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')`.
    *   The end of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (exclusive).

3.  **Group by Month**: The filtered treatments will be partitioned by `calc_month_label`.

4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month group:
    *   `total_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among all treatments in that month.
    *   `biologic_drug_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among treatments in that month where the `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
2.  **`distinct_patient_count = COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `distinct_patient_count` which will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.

4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core condition.
    *   **`treatments_received.WHERE(...)`**: For each patient, this filters their `treatments_received`. A treatment is kept if:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   `start_date_for_period`: This expression calculates the start of the relevant period. It first gets the start of the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`) and then subtracts 6 months (`'-6 months'`). For example, if the current date is July 15th, 2024, the start of the current month is July 1st, 2024. Subtracting 6 months yields January 1st, 2024.
    *   `end_date_for_period`: This expression defines the end of the relevant period (exclusive). It's simply the start of the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`). So, treatments must have a `start_dt` *before* this date. Using the example above, this would be July 1st, 2024.
    *   The period effectively covers the 6 full months prior to the current month (e.g., January to June if the current month is July).

2.  **Main Query Logic**:
    *   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: The query starts from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to produce a single aggregated result.
    *   `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to find all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"". If multiple patients share this name, their treatments will be collectively considered.
    *   `.treatments_received`: For the selected patient(s), it accesses their received treatments.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_date_for_period) & (start_dt < end_date_for_period))`: This filters the treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the defined date range:
        *   `start_dt >= start_date_for_period`: The treatment started on or after the first day of the month 6 months ago.
        *   `start_dt < end_date_for_period`: The treatment started before the first day of the current month.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of treatments that satisfy all the preceding conditions (patient named Alice and treatment date within the specified range).
    *   `num_treatments_for_alice = ...`: The final count is assigned to the field `num_treatments_for_alice`.

The query will return a single row with one column, `num_treatments_for_alice`, indicating the total number of treatments for patient(s) named Alice in the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.",29.116316080093384,"# Define the date boundaries as contextless expressions.

1.  First, for each doctor, we calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by navigating from the `Doctors` collection to their `prescribed_treatments`, then to the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique `drug_id`s. We also select the doctor's ID and specialty, using intermediate names for clarity and potential renaming.
2.  Next, we partition this collection of doctors (now with their distinct drug counts) by their specialty. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  Finally, for the doctors within each specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed (in descending order, so more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures this ranking is done independently for each specialty. We also format the output fields to match the requested names (`doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs`, `SDRSDR`).

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.
# We select doc_id (as doc_id_val), speciality (as speciality_val),
# and count distinct drug_id's from prescribed_treatments.drug.

# Step 3: For doctors within each specialty group, calculate their rank (SDRSDR).
# We access the 'Doctors' collection within each partition (these are the doctors
# from 'doctors_with_drug_counts', now grouped).
# The RANKING is done by 'num_distinct_drugs_val' in descending order,

**Explanation:**

The query is designed to provide a ranked list of doctors based on the diversity of drugs they prescribe, with the ranking performed within each medical specialty.

1.  **`doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `doc_id_val=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID and assigns it to `doc_id_val`.
    *   `speciality_val=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty and assigns it to `speciality_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs_val=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: This calculates the number of unique drugs prescribed by each doctor. It navigates through `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments for the doctor), then to the `drug` for each treatment, and finally to the `drug_id` of that drug. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `drug_id`s. If a doctor has prescribed no drugs, this count will be 0.

2.  **`specialty_partition = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection (where each doctor now has their distinct drug count).
    *   `name=""specialty_group_partition""`: Names the resulting partition structure.
    *   `by=(speciality_val)`: Groups the doctors based on their `speciality_val`. All doctors with the same specialty will be in the same group within this partition.

3.  **`result = specialty_partition.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `specialty_partition.Doctors`: This accesses the individual doctor records within each group of the partition created in the previous step.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id=doc_id_val`: Assigns the doctor's ID to the output field `doc_id`.
        *   `specialty=speciality_val`: Assigns the doctor's specialty to the output field `specialty`. Note the change in spelling from the database field `speciality` to the requested `specialty`.
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs_val`: Assigns the count of distinct drugs to `number_of_distinct_drugs`.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC(), per=""specialty_group_partition"", allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (doctors prescribing more unique drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., Rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_group_partition""`: Crucially, this ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group. A doctor's rank is relative to other doctors in the same specialty.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors within the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each item represents a doctor and includes their `doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs` they prescribed, and their `SDRSDR` rank within that specialty.",72.709463596344,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This starts by accessing the `Doctors` collection and then filters its records based on the conditions provided in the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `first_name` starts with 'j'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
3.  **`CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `last_name` contains the substring 'son'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
4.  **`|`**: This is the logical OR operator, combining the two conditions. A doctor will be included if their first name starts with 'j' OR their last name contains 'son'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this selects and renames the required fields:
    *   `doc_first_name=first_name`: Selects the `first_name` and renames it to `doc_first_name`.

The `start_dt` of treatments is used to determine the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   A new field, `calc_treatment_year_month`, is calculated by combining the year and month from `start_dt` into a 'YYYY-MM' string format (e.g., ""2023-03""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits. This field will be used for grouping.
    *   The `start_dt` is aliased to `calc_treatment_start_dt` to be used in the filtering condition.

2.  **Filter for the Relevant Time Period**:
    *   The treatments are filtered to include only those within the last 12 full months, prior to the current month.
    *   The start of this period is `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-12 months')` (e.g., if today is 2024-07-15, this is 2023-07-01).
    *   The end of this period is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (e.g., 2024-07-01), making the range exclusive of the current month.
    *   The condition is `(calc_treatment_start_dt >= start_of_period) & (calc_treatment_start_dt < end_of_period)`.

3.  **Group by Month and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered treatments are then partitioned (grouped) by `calc_treatment_year_month` using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_data_group"", by=(calc_treatment_year_month))`.
    *   Within each monthly group, the following metrics are calculated:
        *   `output_month`: This is the `calc_treatment_year_month` for the group.
        *   `PMPD_metric`: Calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received a treatment (and thus an associated diagnosis) that started in that month.
        *   `PMTC_metric`: Calculated as `COUNT(Treatments)`. This counts the total number of treatments that started in that month.
    *   The results are ordered by `output_month` in ascending order.

4.  **Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `month`, `PMPD`, and `PMTC` as requested.

1.  Identify the relevant `Outcomes` records: We are interested in records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the condition `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` to check for non-null numeric values, as comparisons with `NULL` typically yield `NULL`, and `NULL` in a `WHERE` condition filters out the row.
2.  Calculate Averages: From these filtered outcomes, we need to compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` globally.
3.  Apply the Formula: Use the given formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
4.  Handle Division by Zero: If the average `day7_pasi_score` is zero, the formula would lead to division by zero. In this case, the result should be `null`.

This will be done using a two-stage `CALCULATE`:
-   The first `CALCULATE` computes `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100` from the filtered `Outcomes`.
-   The second `CALCULATE` uses these averages to compute the final `d7d100pir_percentage`.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block is performed on the top-level `DermTreatment` collection.
    *   It computes two aggregate values:
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d7`: This is the average of `day7_pasi_score` from `Outcomes` records. The `Outcomes` are filtered to include only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` works because if `field` is `NULL`, comparisons like `NULL > 0` result in `NULL`, and `NULL | NULL` is `NULL`, causing the `WHERE` clause to filter out such rows.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: Similarly, this is the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the same set of filtered `Outcomes`.
    *   The result of this stage (`calculation_stage`) is a collection with a single row containing `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100`.

2.  The second `CALCULATE` block operates on `calculation_stage`.
    *   It calculates `d7d100pir_percentage` using the averages computed in the previous stage.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `avg_pasi_score_d7` might be zero. If it is zero, `KEEP_IF(0.0, 1==0)` (which evaluates to `null`) is returned to prevent division by zero errors. Otherwise, the D7D100PIR formula `(avg_pasi_score_d100 - avg_pasi_score_d7) / avg_pasi_score_d7 * 100.0` is applied. The `100.0` ensures floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.

The final `result` will be a collection with one row and one column, `d7d100pir_percentage`, containing the overall D7D100PIR value. A negative percentage indicates an improvement (reduction) in PASI score from day 7 to day 100.",83.17528915405273,"# Stage 1: Calculate average PASI scores for day 7 and day 100 from valid outcomes

What is the PIC for female patients?PIC = private insured patient count,SELECT COUNT(patient_id) AS pic FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Female' AND ins_type = 'private';,DermTreatment,"Okay, I can help you with that.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`private_insured_female_patient_count=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `private_insured_female_patient_count` that will hold the result of our count.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'private'))`**:
    *   We access the `Patients` collection.
    *   We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these patients based on two conditions:
        *   `gender == 'Female'`: Selects only patients whose gender is 'Female'.
        *   `ins_type == 'private'`: Selects only patients whose insurance type is 'private'.
        *   The `&` operator ensures that both conditions must be true for a patient to be included.
4.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function then counts the number of patients that satisfy both conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have at least one prescribed treatment (`prescribed_treatments`) where the associated drug (`drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'. The `HAS` function is used to check for the existence of such treatments.
3.  Group the filtered doctors by their location state (`loc_state`) using the `PARTITION` method. This ensures that we process each state only once.
4.  Use the `CALCULATE` method to output the distinct state names.

```python

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first filters the `Doctors` collection. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HAS` function to check if a doctor has any `prescribed_treatments` that satisfy the condition `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`. This condition navigates from a treatment to its associated drug and checks the drug's type.

Once the relevant doctors are identified, the `PARTITION` method is used. It groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. The `name=""unique_doctor_states""` argument names these groups.

Finally, `CALCULATE(state_name=loc_state)` is applied to the result of the partition. Since `PARTITION` creates groups based on unique `loc_state` values, this `CALCULATE` effectively produces a list of distinct states, renaming `loc_state` to `state_name` in the output.",24.021009922027588,"# Filter doctors to find those who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those who have at least one treatment (`treatments_received`) which, in turn, has at least one outcome assessment (`outcome_records`). The `HAS()` function is suitable for checking this existence.
3.  For the filtered patients, select their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.

The resulting list of patients will inherently be distinct because we are selecting attributes from the `Patients` collection after applying the filter.

patients_with_outcomes = Patients.WHERE(
    HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    pat_id=patient_id,

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Patients`: We begin by accessing the `Patients` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1)`: This filters the patients.
    *   `treatments_received`: Accesses the list of treatments each patient has received.
    *   `.outcome_records`: For each of those treatments, it accesses the list of outcome records.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one outcome record associated with any of the patient's treatments. Only patients meeting this condition are kept.
3.  `.CALCULATE(pat_id=patient_id, pat_first_name=first_name, pat_last_name=last_name)`: This selects the required fields for the patients who passed the filter.
    *   `pat_id=patient_id`: Selects the `patient_id` and renames it to `pat_id`.
    *   `pat_first_name=first_name`: Selects the `first_name` and renames it to `pat_first_name`.
    *   `pat_last_name=last_name`: Selects the `last_name` and renames it to `pat_last_name`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection, which contains all drug records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_used_in) == 1)`**: This filters the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection of `Drugs` that lists all treatments in which a particular drug was used.
    *   `HASNOT(treatments_used_in)` checks if this sub-collection is empty for each drug.
    *   `== 1` (which is equivalent to `is True`) ensures we only keep drugs for which `treatments_used_in` is empty, meaning the drug has not been used in any treatments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Patients` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these patients.
    *   `HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1` checks if the `treatments_received` sub-collection for each patient is empty. `treatments_received` is a list of treatments associated with a patient.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**:

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Diagnoses` collection. The `HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider diagnoses for which there is at least one treatment leading to an outcome where the `day100_itch_vas` score is recorded (not null).
2.  `CALCULATE(...)`: For each diagnosis that passes the filter:
    *   `diag_name_val=diag_name`: Stores the diagnosis name.
    *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the highest `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function aggregates scores from the `outcome_records` sub-collection, which are linked via `treatments_for`.
    *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None).treatment.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients. This path navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments (`treatments_for`), then to the outcomes of those treatments (`outcome_records`), filters these outcomes to those with a recorded `day100_itch_vas`, then links back from each such outcome to its parent treatment (`.treatment`), then to the patient associated with that treatment (`.patient`), and finally gets the `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique patient IDs. This ensures the patient count is specific to those contributing to the `day100_itch_vas` data for the diagnosis.
3.  `TOP_K(3, by=(max_itch_score_val.DESC(), num_patients_val.DESC()))`: This selects the top 3 diagnoses. They are ordered first by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). If there's a tie in scores, `num_patients_val` (also descending) is used as a tie-breaker.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   The code first defines `date_filter_start` and `date_filter_end` to establish the time window for ""past 6 calendar months"". This is interpreted as the six full calendar months immediately preceding the current month. For instance, if the current date is in July, this period would span from January 1st to June 30th of the same year.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` calculates the start of the month that was six months ago.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the start of the current month, which serves as the exclusive end point for the date range.

2.  **Treatment Filtering and Information Extraction**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Using `CALCULATE`, it derives two new fields for each treatment:
        *   `treatment_actual_start_dt`: Copied from the treatment's `start_dt`.
        *   `doc_specialty_field`: The specialty of the prescribing doctor, obtained by accessing `doctor.speciality`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause then filters these treatments, keeping only those where `treatment_actual_start_dt` falls within the calculated `date_filter_start` (inclusive) and `date_filter_end` (exclusive).

3.  **Aggregation by Specialty**:
    *   The `filtered_treatments_with_info` collection is then processed using `PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty_field))`. This groups the treatments based on the `doc_specialty_field` (the doctor's specialty).
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each specialty), `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The specialty name (from `doc_specialty_field`).
        *   `num_treatments`: The total count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered date range. `COUNT(Treatments)` refers to counting the underlying `Treatments` records that belong to this specific partition group.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with that specialty in the filtered date range. `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)` sums the `tot_drug_amt` from the underlying `Treatments` records in the partition group.

4.  **Top 3 Selection**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_based_aggregation`. This selects the top 3 doctor specialties, ordered by the `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

5.  **Result**:
    *   The `result` variable holds the final output, which is a collection of up to 3 records, each containing the `specialty`, `num_treatments`, and `total_drug_amount` for the top-ranking doctor specialties.",70.43072962760925,"# Define the date range for ""past 6 calendar months""

    *   This takes the results from the previous step (one record per insurance type with its average height and weight).
    *   It selects the top 3 records based on the `avg_height_cm_val` in descending order (highest average height first).

4.  **`.CALCULATE(insurance_type=ins_type, average_height=avg_height_cm_val, average_weight=avg_weight_kg_val)`**:

    *   `.CALCULATE(drug_name = drug_name, ...)`: After selecting the top 5 drugs, this final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:

1.  Define a date variable representing ""6 months ago from today"" and another for ""today"" to make the date comparisons clear.
2.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
3.  Filter these treatments based on three conditions:
    *   The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. This check will be case-insensitive and allow for wildcards using the `LIKE` function on the lowercase version of `diag_name`.
    *   The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. This is checked by ensuring the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field for the associated drug is populated, using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   The treatment's `end_dt` must fall within the last 6 months from today (inclusive of 6 months ago and today).
4.  Finally, count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions using `COUNT()` within a `CALCULATE` clause on the top-level `DermTreatment` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `six_months_ago_from_today = DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
2.  `today_date = DATETIME('now')`: This line defines a variable holding the current date and time.
3.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters:
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition filters treatments where the associated diagnosis's name (`diagnosis.diag_name`) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `LIKE` with `%` wildcards allows 'psoriasis' to appear anywhere in the name.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the drug used in the treatment (`drug`) has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function checks for the existence or non-nullity of this date.
    *   `(end_dt >= six_months_ago_from_today) & (end_dt <= today_date)`: This compound condition filters treatments that have an `end_dt` (end date) that is on or after 6 months ago from today, and on or before today. This effectively selects treatments that ended within the last 6-month period.
4.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(count_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`: Finally, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a calculation. `COUNT(filtered_treatments)` counts the number of treatment records that met all the conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

1.  Calculate the target registration year: This will be the current year minus 2. We use `YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`.
2.  Filter the `Doctors` collection to include only those whose `year_reg` matches this target year.
3.  For each of these doctors:
    a.  Access their `prescribed_treatments`.
    b.  Identify the ""first treatment"" by finding the treatment with the earliest `start_dt`. We use the `RANKING` function, ordering by `start_dt` in ascending order, partitioned per doctor. We select the treatment where `RANKING(...) == 1`.
    c.  Use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this first treatment as a single record, allowing access to its fields.
4.  In the final `CALCULATE` step, select the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`.
5.  Extract the `start_dt` (as `first_treatment_date`) and `treatment_id` (as `first_treatment_id`) from the first treatment record. We use `DEFAULT_TO(..., None)` to gracefully handle cases where a doctor might not have any treatments, in which case these fields will be null.

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(year_reg == (YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2))`: This line filters the `Doctors` collection. It selects doctors whose `year_reg` (year of registration) is exactly 2 years before the current year (obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`).
2.  The first `CALCULATE(...)` call operates on these filtered doctors:
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`, `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: These lines temporarily store the doctor's last name and year of registration.
    *   `first_treatment_record=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1).SINGULAR()`: This is the core logic for finding the first treatment.
        *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1)`: Filters these treatments.
            *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)`: Assigns a rank to each treatment based on its `start_dt` in ascending order (earliest first). The ranking is done `per=""Doctors""`, meaning it's done independently for each doctor's list of treatments. `allow_ties=False` ensures that if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, only one is ranked as 1.
            *   `== 1`: Selects only the treatment(s) with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record, or empty if no treatments) into an accessible singular record. If no treatments match, `first_treatment_record` will be effectively null.
3.  The second `CALCULATE(...)` call formats the final output:
    *   `last_name=doc_last_name`, `year_of_registration=doc_year_reg`: Selects the doctor's last name and year of registration, using the desired output field names.
    *   `first_treatment_date=DEFAULT_TO(first_treatment_record.start_dt, None)`: Retrieves the `start_dt` from the `first_treatment_record`. If `first_treatment_record` is null (e.g., the doctor has no treatments), this defaults to `None`.
    *   `first_treatment_id=DEFAULT_TO(first_treatment_record.treatment_id, None)`: Retrieves the `treatment_id` from the `first_treatment_record`. Similarly, defaults to `None` if there's no first treatment.

            *   `concomitant_meds.start_dt >= start_dt`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date (`start_dt` here refers to `Treatments.start_dt`).
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, concomitant_meds.start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started within 14 days (2 weeks) of the treatment's start date. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days.

2.  **`result = qualifying_treatments.concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Once we have the `qualifying_treatments`, we access their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This means for each qualifying treatment, we will iterate through all its associated concomitant medications.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the output rows. For each concomitant medication of a qualifying treatment, it selects:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`: The ID of the parent treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_dt = treatment.start_dt`: The start date of the parent treatment.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, which is suitable for computing a single aggregate value.
2.  **`AVG(...)`**: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""male"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`**:
    *   This part accesses the `Patients` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these patients to include only those where:
        *   `gender` is equal to `""male""`.
        *   `ins_type` is equal to `""private""`.
        *   Both conditions must be true due to the `&` (AND) operator.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`**:
    *   This `CALCULATE` operates on the filtered set of patients.
    *   It computes a new field named `age_in_years` for each patient.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`), effectively giving their current age in integer years.
5.  **`.age_in_years`**: This accesses the `age_in_years` field (computed in the previous step) from the collection of filtered and age-calculated patients. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these ages.
6.  **`average_age = ...`**: The final result of the average calculation is assigned to a field named `average_age` within the output of `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant:

    b.  From these successful transactions, count the number of distinct `coupon_id`s that are present. This gives the ""number of distinct coupons used"".

3.  Return the merchant's name and the calculated CPUR.

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection.
2.  `merchant_name_field=name`: We select the merchant's `name` and assign it to `merchant_name_field`.
3.  `distinct_coupons_in_successful_tx_count=NDISTINCT(...)`:
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon_id) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were `""successful""` and had a `coupon_id` (meaning a coupon was used).
    *   `.coupon_id`: We then take the `coupon_id` from these filtered transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: This function counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s, giving us the ""number of distinct coupons used"" for successful transactions by that merchant.
4.  `successful_tx_count=COUNT(...)`:
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were `""successful""`.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of such successful transactions, giving us the ""number of distinct transactions"" (since each transaction record is distinct).
5.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` (stored in `merchant_intermediate_stats`) is then passed to a second `CALCULATE`.
6.  `merchant_name=merchant_name_field`: We select the merchant's name for the final output.

1.  Define a contextless expression for the start of the current week. This will be used as a reference point.
2.  Filter the `Users` collection to include only users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  Access the `notifications` sub-collection for these filtered users.
4.  For each notification, calculate two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start_ts`: The `created_at` timestamp truncated to the start of its week. This allows grouping by week.
    *   `is_weekend_notification`: A boolean indicating if the notification's `created_at` timestamp falls on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using the `DAYNAME` function.
5.  Filter these augmented notifications to include only those from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week. This is achieved by:
    *   Calculating the difference in weeks between the `notification_week_start_ts` and the `current_week_start_val` using `DATEDIFF`.
    *   Keeping only notifications where this difference is 1 (last week), 2 (two weeks ago), or 3 (three weeks ago).

**Explanation:**

The query first establishes `current_week_start_val` as the beginning of the current week. It then filters users to those in the ""US"" or ""Canada"". For each notification from these users, it determines the start of the week the notification was created (`notification_week_start_ts`) and whether it was sent on a weekend (`is_weekend_notification`).

Next, it filters these notifications to include only those from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week. This is done using `DATEDIFF` to find notifications where the difference between their week-start and the current week-start is 1, 2, or 3 weeks.

These filtered notifications are then partitioned by `notification_week_start_ts`. Within each partition (representing a specific week), the query calculates:
-   `week_start_date`: The start date of that week.
-   `total_notifications_in_week`: The total count of notifications for that week.
-   `weekend_notifications_in_week`: The count of notifications sent on weekends during that week, by summing the `is_weekend_notification` boolean values.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and then apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   **`(status == ""active"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `status` is ""active"".
    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `category` is ""retail"". The `LOWER()` function is used on the `category` field to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, matching ""Retail"", ""retail"", ""RETAIL"", etc.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition filters for merchants who have at least one coupon. The `HAS(coupons)` function returns true (or 1 in PyDough's context for boolean checks in `WHERE`) if the `coupons` sub-collection for a merchant is not empty.
    *   The `&` operator is used to combine these conditions, so a merchant must satisfy all three to be included.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use the `CALCULATE` function to specify the output fields.

"What is the average AMB for user wallets updated in the past week, inclusive of 7 days ago? Return the average balance.AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)","SELECT AVG(balance) AS AMB FROM wallet_user_balance_daily WHERE updated_at >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Ewallet,"The query aims to calculate the average AMB (Average Balance per User) for user wallets whose balances were updated in the past week, inclusive of 7 days ago.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  **Filter Relevant Balances**: First, we filter the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today and 7 days prior. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now'))` to ensure the difference is between 0 and 7 days.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: The problem defines AMB as ""average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". This means for each user, we need to average their balance entries that fall within the filtered 7-day period. We use `PARTITION` by `user_id` on the filtered balances. Then, for each user's group of balances, we calculate `AVG(UserBalances.balance)` to get their individual AMB for the period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, we take all the per-user AMB values calculated in the previous step and compute their average. This gives the overall ""average AMB for user wallets"". This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `amb_value` field from the collection of per-user AMBs.

The final result is a single value representing this average AMB.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for records updated in the past 7 days (inclusive of 7 days ago up to now).
# DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) will be 0 for today, 7 for 7 days ago.
# It will be negative if updated_at is in the future, so >= 0 handles that.
recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)

The `per=""Users""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each user.
4.  We filter these ranked balances to keep only the one where the rank is 1.
5.  The `SINGULAR()` function is then used to treat this single, most recent balance record as a singular item.
6.  Finally, we extract the `balance` amount from this record.

This rank is based on the revenue generated from successfully received transactions, specifically where the `receiver_type` is 1 (indicating a merchant). We need to return the merchant's name, category, their calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank (MRR).

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Start with Merchants**: We iterate through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  **Calculate Revenue**: For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue.
    *   This involves looking at their `transactions_received`.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those that were `successful` and where the `receiver_type` is `1`. The problem statement specifies `receiver_type=1` for transactions to merchants. Although transactions in `Merchants.transactions_received` inherently have the merchant as the receiver (and thus should have `receiver_type` indicating 'MERCHANT'), we include this filter explicitly as per the problem's instruction.
    *   We then sum the `amount` of these filtered transactions. We assume that if a merchant has no such transactions, this sum will be 0.
3.  **Assign Rank (MRR)**: After calculating the revenue for all merchants, we rank them.
    *   The rank (named `MRR`) is based on `revenue_amount` in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).
    *   We'll use `allow_ties=True` in the `RANKING` function so that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).
4.  **Select Output Fields**: We select the `merchant_name` (from `name`), `merchant_category` (from `category`), the calculated `revenue_amount`, and the `MRR`.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, we order the results by `MRR` in ascending order for clear presentation.

We make the following assumptions:
*   The status of a successful transaction is represented by the string `""successful""` in the `status` field of the `Transactions` collection.
*   `receiver_type == 1` is the correct condition to identify transactions where the receiver is a merchant.
*   The `SUM` aggregation function will return `0` if there are no transactions meeting the criteria for a merchant.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `revenue_amount=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`: This calculates the total revenue for the merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the current merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is ""successful"" and `receiver_type` is 1.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Aggregates these amounts to get the total revenue for the merchant.

2.  `merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call takes the result from the first step (which includes merchant name, category, and their revenue amount) and adds the rank.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`, `merchant_category=merchant_category`, `revenue_amount=revenue_amount`: These pass through the already calculated/selected fields.
    *   `MRR=RANKING(by=revenue_amount.DESC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank for each merchant.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: The ranking function.
        *   `by=revenue_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that ranking should be based on `revenue_amount` in descending order (higher revenue means better rank).
        *   `allow_ties=True`: Ensures that if multiple merchants have the same `revenue_amount`, they receive the same rank.

Based on the provided definition, PMDAU is taken to mean the count of distinct senders (where `sender_type = 0`) who made transactions within each respective month. The `created_at` timestamp is truncated to the start of the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates the date boundaries for the period of interest.
    *   `current_month_boundary`: The start of the current month. Transactions on or after this date are excluded.
    *   `start_period_boundary`: The start of the month that was two months before the current month. Transactions on or after this date (and before `current_month_boundary`) are included.
    *   For example, if today is July 15th, 2023, `current_month_boundary` would be 2023-07-01, and `start_period_boundary` would be 2023-05-01. The query would consider transactions from May 1st, 2023, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2023 (i.e., transactions in May and June).

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   It accesses the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0`.
    *   Filters transactions to fall within the calculated date range (`>= start_period_boundary` and `< current_month_boundary`).
    *   For each of these filtered transactions, it calculates `transaction_month_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the first day of its month. This field will be used for grouping.

3.  **Calculate PMDAU per Month**:
    *   The prepared transaction data is then partitioned by `transaction_month_start`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `year_val`: The year of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `month_val`: The month number of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `pmdau`: The number of distinct `sender_id` values within that month's transactions. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by year and then by month for a clear, chronological presentation.

This approach directly implements the definition ""PMDAU = distinct sender with sender\_type = 0"" and ""Truncate created\_at to month for aggregation"", interpreting PMDAU as the count of unique active users per month for the specified period.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users`: We start by selecting the `Users` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(user_type != 'merchant')`: This filters the users, keeping only those whose `user_type` attribute is not equal to 'merchant'. This ensures we are only considering non-merchant users.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `user_id=uid`: We select the `uid` field from the `Users` collection and rename it to `user_id` in the output.
    *   `total_transaction_count=COUNT(transactions_sent)`: For each user that passes the filter, we count the number of transactions in their `transactions_sent` sub-collection.

1.  **Filter and Calculate Individual Session Durations**:
    *   Access the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   Filter sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after `2023-06-01T00:00:00` and before `2023-06-08T00:00:00`.
    *   For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We'll name this `calculated_session_duration`.
    *   Ensure `user_id` is carried forward for partitioning.

2.  **Group by User and Aggregate Durations**:
    *   Partition the resulting collection by `user_id`. Let's name the partition group `user_partition_group`.
    *   For each user (each group in the partition), calculate the sum of `calculated_session_duration` from all their sessions in the filtered range. This gives the total session duration per user.

3.  **Order and Select Final Output**:
    *   Order the aggregated results by the total session duration in descending order (longest duration first).
    *   Select the `user_id` and the calculated total duration, renaming them as required by the prompt.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable stores the result of filtering `UserSessions`. It includes only those sessions that started between June 1, 2023 (inclusive) and June 8, 2023 (exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_session_duration` which is the duration of that single session in seconds. The `user_id` is also explicitly selected to be used as a key in the next step.
2.  `user_aggregated_data`: This step takes `sessions_with_duration` and partitions it by `user_id`.
    *   `name=""user_partition_group""` gives a name to the groups within the partition.
    *   `by=(user_id)` specifies that sessions should be grouped based on their `user_id`.
    *   In the subsequent `CALCULATE` clause:
        *   `user_id_key=user_id` selects the partitioning key (the user's ID).
        *   `summed_duration_seconds=SUM(user_partition_group.calculated_session_duration)` calculates the total session time for each user by summing up the `calculated_session_duration` of all sessions belonging to that user within the partition group.
3.  `sorted_user_durations`: The data is then sorted by `summed_duration_seconds` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.
4.  `result`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested by the prompt. The `total_duration` will be an integer value representing seconds.",76.19986200332642,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by date and calculate duration for each session.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`**: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Merchants` collection and filters it to select only the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is equal to `1`.
2.  **`.coupons`**: From the selected merchant (with `mid == 1`), this accesses its `coupons` sub-collection. This gives us a list of all coupons offered by this specific merchant.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is then applied to each coupon in the list obtained from the previous step.
    *   **`coupon_id=cid`**: It selects the `cid` (coupon ID) for each coupon and renames it to `coupon_id` in the output.
    *   **`total_transacted_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`**: For each coupon, it accesses the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which lists all transactions where this coupon was used).

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date`: This variable defines the beginning of the previous month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncating it to the start of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracting one month (`'-1 month'`).
2.  `current_month_start_date`: This variable defines the end of the previous month (exclusive), which is equivalent to the beginning of the current month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp and truncating it to the start of the current month.
3.  `transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the `prev_month_start_date` (inclusive) and `current_month_start_date` (exclusive).
4.  `str_calculation_output = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This block performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` graph level, resulting in a single row.
    *   `num_successful_transactions`: Counts transactions from `transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is ""completed"". This is our definition of a successful transaction.
    *   `num_total_transactions`: Counts all transactions within `transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_str = ...)`: This chained `CALCULATE` uses the counts from the previous step to compute the STR.
    *   `IFF(num_total_transactions > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This conditional function checks if there were any transactions in the previous month.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `num_successful_transactions * 1.0 / num_total_transactions`. The `* 1.0` ensures floating-point division.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is 0 (to prevent division by zero), `calculated_str` is set to `0.0`.

2.  Filter these users to include only those whose `country` is 'us' (case-insensitively).
3.  Further filter these users to include only those who have at least one `notification` that is of `notification_type` 'promotional' and has a `status` of 'unread'. The `HAS` function is used for this check.
4.  For the remaining users, use `CALCULATE` to:

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Users` collection.
    *   `LOWER(country) == 'us'`: This condition ensures that only users whose country is 'US' are considered, ignoring case differences (e.g., 'us', 'US', 'Us').
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria.
        *   `notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`: This filters the `notifications` sub-collection for each user to find notifications that are both 'promotional' by type and 'unread' in status.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For users who pass the `WHERE` clause filters, this function projects the desired output.
    *   `username=username`: Selects the `username` field from the `Users` collection.
    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(...)`: Calculates the total number of unread promotional notifications for each user. The `COUNT` function aggregates the notifications that match the inner `WHERE` clause (`(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`).

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This will be the first day of the month of the transaction, derived using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will serve as our grouping key for months.
    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `month_as_date_obj`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (our partition key), representing the month.
    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  From the filtered list of merchants, select their merchant ID (`mid`). We will alias this as `merchant_id` in the output.

This approach ensures that the list of merchant IDs is distinct because we are querying the `Merchants` collection where `mid` is inherently unique for each merchant. It also considers all transaction types as no filter is applied on the `transaction_type` within `transactions_received`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_transactions_with_country = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(sender_user_country_attr = sending_user.country)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0`, indicating the sender is a user.
    *   It then uses `CALCULATE` to add a new attribute `sender_user_country_attr`, which stores the `country` of the `sending_user` associated with each transaction.

2.  `country_level_summary = user_transactions_with_country.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `user_transactions_with_country` collection (which contains user-sent transactions with their sender's country).
    *   It partitions these transactions using `PARTITION(name=""transactions_grouped_by_country"", by=(sender_user_country_attr))`. This groups the transactions by the `sender_user_country_attr`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., for each country):
        *   `country = sender_user_country_attr`:  Selects the country name (which was the partition key).
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within that country group. It refers to the `amount` field of the original `Transactions` records that fall into this partition.
        *   `number_of_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: Counts the number of unique `uid`s of the `sending_user` for transactions within that country group. This gives the number of distinct users who sent transactions from that country.

3.  `top_5_countries_by_total_amount = country_level_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the `country_level_summary` (which has aggregates per country).
    *   It uses `TOP_K` to select the top 5 countries. The `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()` clause ensures the selection is based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

4.  `result = top_5_countries_by_total_amount`:
    *   The `top_5_countries_by_total_amount` collection already contains the three requested fields (`country`, `number_of_distinct_users`, `total_transaction_amount`) for the top 5 countries, so it is assigned directly to `result`.",66.90220165252686,"# Step 1: Filter transactions sent by users (sender_type = 0) and calculate the sender's country.

1.  **Identify the latest balance for each merchant**: We access all merchant balance entries (`Merchants.balances`). For each merchant, we rank their balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order and select the top one. This gives us the most recent balance for every merchant who has balance records. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as this most recent balance.
2.  **Filter these latest balances based on merchant criteria**: From the set of latest balance entries, we keep only those whose associated merchant:
    *   Has `status == 'active'`.
    *   Has a `category` that contains 'retail'. The search for 'retail' is made case-insensitive by converting the category to lowercase.
3.  **Calculate the median**: For the final set of filtered balance entries, we calculate the median of their `balance` amounts. This will be a single value representing the requested median.

The query is structured to handle cases where merchants might not have balance entries or where no merchants meet the specified criteria (in which case the median would typically be null).

```python
# Step 1: Get the latest balance entry for each merchant.
# Merchants.balances refers to all balance entries across all merchants.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_balance_entries = Merchants.balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing `Merchants.balances`, which represents the collection of all balance records for all merchants.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records.
    *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1` assigns a rank to each balance record within the group of balances belonging to the same merchant (`per=""Merchants""`). The ranking is based on `updated_at` in descending order, so rank 1 is the most recent balance entry.
    *   The result, `latest_balance_entries`, is a collection of `MerchantBalance` records, containing exactly one (the most recent) balance entry for each merchant that has any balance entries.

2.  `filtered_latest_balances = latest_balance_entries.WHERE((merchant.status == 'active') & CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail'))`:
    *   This line takes the `latest_balance_entries` from the previous step.
    *   It applies another `WHERE` clause to filter these entries further.
    *   The condition `merchant.status == 'active'` checks if the merchant associated with the balance entry is active.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail')` checks if the merchant's category (converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity) contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   The result, `filtered_latest_balances`, is a collection of `MerchantBalance` records from active, retail-related merchants, representing their latest balances.

3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_merchant_balance = MEDIAN(filtered_latest_balances.balance))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result.
    *   `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)` creates a new collection with a single row (since `Ewallet` is the top-level graph object).
    *   `median_merchant_balance = MEDIAN(filtered_latest_balances.balance)` calculates the median of the `balance` attribute for all records in the `filtered_latest_balances` collection. This value is assigned to the field `median_merchant_balance`.

The final `result` will be a single-row collection with one column, `median_merchant_balance`, holding the calculated median value.

Explanation:

- The `PARTITION` method then groups these sessions based on their `device_type`. Each group is named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.
- The second `CALCULATE` method operates on these partitioned groups.
    - `device_type = device_type`: This selects the `device_type` (which is the key for the partition).
    - `average_duration_seconds = AVG(UserSessions.session_len_seconds)`: This calculates the average of the `session_len_seconds` (computed in the first step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. `UserSessions.session_len_seconds` refers to the `session_len_seconds` field that was conceptually added to each record of `UserSessions` by the initial `CALCULATE` operation.

    *   The `earliest_coupon_record.start_date` must be strictly before one year from `m_registration_date`. This is achieved by comparing it with `DATETIME(m_registration_date, '+1 year')`. This interprets ""within a year"" as a period strictly less than 365/366 days from the registration date.
5.  Finally, select and rename the required fields for the output:
    *   `merchant_id` from `m_id`.
    *   `registration_date` from `m_registration_date`.
    *   `earliest_coupon_id` from `earliest_coupon_record.cid`.
    *   `earliest_coupon_start_date` from `earliest_coupon_record.start_date`.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, calculate a timestamp representing the end of their first year. This is done by adding one year to their `created_at` (sign-up) date. We'll alias the necessary fields (`username`, `email`, `created_at`) for clarity and later use.
3.  Filter these users. A user is kept if they have no notifications (`notifications` sub-collection) whose `created_at` date falls before this calculated one-year mark. This is achieved using `HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0`. This condition correctly includes users with no notifications at all, as well as users whose notifications all occurred after their first year.
4.  Finally, select the `username`, `email`, and the original `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`) for the users who meet the criteria.

```python
users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
    # Alias fields from the Users collection for clarity and use in subsequent operations
    user_username = username,
    user_email = email,
    user_signup_date = created_at,
    # Calculate the marker for the end of the user's first year
    end_of_first_year_marker = DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')
).WHERE(
    # Filter users: keep those who have NO notifications (HAS(...) == 0)
    # where the notification's creation date is before the end_of_first_year_marker.
    # This covers users with no notifications at all, or users whose notifications are all after the first year.
    HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0
).CALCULATE(
    # Select the requested fields for the output
    username = user_username,
    email = user_email,
    signup_date = user_signup_date
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We begin by processing the `Users` collection. In this step, we:
    *   Alias `username` to `user_username`, `email` to `user_email`, and `created_at` to `user_signup_date`. This helps in clearly referencing these values later.
    *   Calculate `end_of_first_year_marker`: For each user, this new field stores the timestamp exactly one year after their `created_at` date (sign-up date), using the `DATETIME` function.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0)`: This filters the users based on their notification history.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)`: For each user, this filters their associated `notifications` to include only those created *before* the `end_of_first_year_marker` (i.e., within their first year).
    *   `HAS(...)`: This function checks if the filtered set of notifications (those within the first year) has any records. It returns `1` (True) if there's at least one such notification, and `0` (False) otherwise.
    *   `... == 0`: The overall condition keeps users for whom `HAS(...)` is `0`, meaning they have no notifications that were created within their first year of signing up.

3.  `.CALCULATE(username = user_username, email = user_email, signup_date = user_signup_date)`: For the users who passed the filter, this step selects and formats the final output:
    *   `username`: The user's username.
    *   `email`: The user's email.
    *   `signup_date`: The user's original sign-up date (`created_at`).",38.7426643371582,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
