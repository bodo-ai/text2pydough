1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. This can be checked by counting the `transactions_made` for each customer.
3.  For the filtered customers, calculate their success rate. We'll define a successful transaction as one where the `status` field in the `Transactions` collection (aliased as `transactions_made` here) is ""Completed"". The success rate will be `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100`.
4.  Select the customer's name and their calculated success rate.
5.  Order the results by the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
customer_transaction_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(
    COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers.
    *   `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.
    *   The condition `COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5` ensures that only customers with 5 or more transactions are considered.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This function is applied to the filtered set of customers.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the customer and renames it to `customer_name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: Calculates the success rate.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This represents the number of successful transactions.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by the calculated `success_rate`.
    *   `.ASC()` specifies ascending order, so customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.",22.936030387878418,"customer_transaction_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(

1.  **Define FAANG Ticker Symbols**: Create a list of the ticker symbols for FAANG companies ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX').
2.  **Filter Customers**:
    *   Start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter customers based on two conditions:
        *   The customer's `email` address must end with "".com"" (using `ENDSWITH`).
        *   The customer must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols (using `HAS` in conjunction with `ISIN`).
3.  **Count Distinct Customers**:
    *   Use `COUNT` on the filtered collection of customers. Since each record in the `Customers` collection represents a distinct customer, counting the records in the filtered set gives the number of distinct customers meeting the criteria.
4.  **Output the Result**:
    *   Use `Broker.CALCULATE` to produce a single result: the total count of these distinct customers.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates `current_week_start_val` (the start date of the current week) and `eight_weeks_ago_start_val` (the start date of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week). This is done on the `Broker` collection level to make these values available downstream.

2.  **Filter Stock Transactions**:
    *   It accesses `Broker.Transactions` and filters them to include only transactions where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'stock'.

3.  **Calculate Transaction Week and Weekend Flag**:
    *   For each stock transaction, it calculates:
        *   `transaction_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred (using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`).
        *   `is_weekend_txn`: A flag (1 if weekend, 0 if weekday) determined by checking if `DAYNAME(date_time)` is 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.

4.  **Filter for Relevant Weeks**:
    *   The transactions are then filtered to include only those whose `transaction_week_start` falls within the last 8 weeks, excluding the current week. This is achieved by the condition:
        `(transaction_week_start < current_week_start_val) & (transaction_week_start >= eight_weeks_ago_start_val)`.

5.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered transactions are partitioned by `transaction_week_start`.
    *   For each week (each partition group), it calculates:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (the partition key).
        *   `total_stock_txns`: The total count of stock transactions in that week using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns`: The count of stock transactions that occurred on a weekend in that week, by summing the `is_weekend_txn` flag (`SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_txn)`).

6.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the date range for ""last week"".
    *   `_current_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date (and time) of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `_last_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date (and time) of the previous week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week, using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`.
    The ""last week"" period will be from `_last_week_start_dt` (inclusive) to `_current_week_start_dt` (exclusive).

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   We start by accessing `Customers` and filter them where their `country` is ""USA"".
    *   Then, we access their `transactions_made`.
    *   These transactions are further filtered to include only those where the `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" range defined in step 1. This collection of transactions is stored in the `filtered_transactions_usa_last_week` variable.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   Finally, we use `Broker.CALCULATE` to compute the required aggregates from the `filtered_transactions_usa_last_week` collection:

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer by applying the `COUNT` aggregation function to the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function.

2.  `result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary`.
    *   Another `CALCULATE` is used to select the final fields and compute the rank:

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions where `transaction_type` is ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these buy transactions to include only those that occurred ""in the past 10 days"". We interpret ""past 10 days"" as today and the 9 preceding calendar days.

2.  **Filter by Date**: We filter these annotated daily price records to include only those where the `date` falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today.

3.  **Group by Ticker Type**: The filtered records are then partitioned (grouped) by the `ticker_type_field`.

We interpret an ""Active Customer"" as a customer whose `status` field is 'Active'. This interpretation leverages the available `status` field in the `Customers` collection and gives distinct meaning to both ""Active Customer"" and ""with Transactions"" parts of the definition.

The PyDough code will perform the following steps:
1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered customers, determine two boolean flags:
    *   `is_active_with_transactions_flag`: True if the customer's `status` is 'Active' AND they have at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made)`). This corresponds to the customers counted in the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has at least one transaction. This corresponds to the customers counted in the denominator.
3.  Partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country, sum the flags calculated in step 2 to get:
    *   `numerator_count`: The total number of active customers with transactions.
    *   `denominator_count`: The total number of customers with transactions.
5.  Calculate the AR for each country using the formula. If `denominator_count` is zero, AR will be set to 0.0 to avoid division by zero and indicate no relevant transaction activity.
6.  The final result will include the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_filtered_and_flagged`:
    *   This expression starts by filtering the `Customers` collection to retain only customers who joined in the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`).
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered customers:
        *   `cust_country = country`: Selects the customer's country, aliasing it to `cust_country` for use as a partitioning key.
        *   `is_active_with_transactions_flag`: This boolean flag is `True` if a customer's `status` is 'Active' AND they have one or more transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This identifies customers contributing to the AR numerator.
        *   `has_transactions_flag`: This boolean flag is `True` if a customer has one or more transactions. This identifies customers contributing to the AR denominator.

2.  `country_aggregates`:
    *   This expression takes `customers_filtered_and_flagged` and partitions it by `cust_country` (the customer's country). Each partition group (`country_partition`) contains customers from a specific country.
    *   `CALCULATE` then operates on each country's group:
        *   `country_name_output = cust_country`: Preserves the country name for the final output.
        *   `numerator_count = SUM(is_active_with_transactions_flag)`: Counts how many customers in that country are 'Active' and have transactions by summing the `is_active_with_transactions_flag`.
        *   `denominator_count = SUM(has_transactions_flag)`: Counts how many customers in that country have transactions by summing the `has_transactions_flag`.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country` (assigned to `result`):
    *   This final `CALCULATE` computes the Activity Ratio for each country from the aggregated counts.
    *   `country = country_name_output`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(denominator_count > 0, (numerator_count * 100.0) / denominator_count, 0.0)`: Calculates the AR.
        *   `IFF(denominator_count > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This conditional logic prevents division by zero. If `denominator_count` (total customers with transactions) is greater than 0, AR is calculated as `(numerator_count * 100.0) / denominator_count`. The `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage.
        *   If `denominator_count` is 0 (meaning no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), AR is set to `0.0`.

8.  Assign this count to a field in a `Broker.CALCULATE()` call to get a single result.

```python
qualified_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(
    number_of_customers=COUNT(
        Customers.WHERE(
            (
                STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"") | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")
            ) & 
            ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), ""a"")
        )
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used to compute a single aggregated value from the `Customers` collection.
2.  `number_of_customers=COUNT(...)`: We are calculating a new field `number_of_customers` which will hold the count of customers meeting the criteria.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Customers` collection based on the specified conditions.
4.  `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's name to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
5.  `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"")`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with ""j"".
6.  `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with ""ez"".
7.  `(... | ...)`: The OR operator combines the two name conditions. A customer satisfies this part if their name starts with ""j"" OR ends with ""ez"".
8.  `LOWER(state)`: Converts the customer's state to lowercase.
9.  `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), ""a"")`: Checks if the lowercase state ends with ""a"".
10. `(... & ...)`: The AND operator combines the name condition group with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.
11. `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of customers that satisfy all the combined conditions.",13.297014713287354,"qualified_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   Start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, calculate necessary fields:
        *   `ticker_sym`: The symbol of the ticker associated with the transaction.
        *   `trans_amount`: The amount of the transaction.
        *   `trans_tax`: The tax amount of the transaction.
        *   `trans_commission`: The commission amount of the transaction.
        *   `trans_type`: The type of the transaction (e.g., ""sell"").
        *   `trans_datetime`: The date and time of the transaction.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those where:
        *   `trans_type` is ""sell"".
        *   `trans_datetime` is within the last month (i.e., greater than or equal to one month ago from the current time). We use `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` to get the date one month ago.

2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the prepared and filtered transactions by `ticker_sym`. This groups all relevant sell transactions for each unique ticker symbol.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol):
        *   Calculate `total_amount_from_sells_calc`: This is the sum of `trans_amount` for all transactions in the group.
        *   Calculate `total_tax_plus_commission_calc`: This is the sum of (`trans_tax` + `trans_commission`) for all transactions in the group. To do this, we first calculate `cost_item = trans_tax + trans_commission` for each transaction within the group and then sum these `cost_item` values.

3.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, calculate the SPM for each ticker symbol.
    *   The SPM formula is: `(Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`.
    *   In our terms: `(total_amount_from_sells_calc - total_tax_plus_commission_calc) / total_amount_from_sells_calc * 100.0`.
    *   We must handle the case where `total_amount_from_sells_calc` is zero to prevent division by zero. In such cases, SPM will be set to `0.0`.

4.  **Format Output**:
    *   The final result should include the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `spm_value`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the PyDough code:

1.  **`daily_prices_enhanced`**:
    *   Starts with the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Extract the ticker symbol (`ticker_s_field`) from the related `ticker` record.
        *   Extract the year (`year_field`) and month (`month_field`) from the `date`.
        *   Alias the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices to new field names (`close_price_field`, `high_price_field`, `low_price_field`) for clarity in subsequent steps.

2.  **`ticker_group_partition`**:
    *   Partitions the `daily_prices_enhanced` data by `ticker_s_field`.
    *   The `name=""ticker_level_group""` assigns a name to these ticker-specific groups, which will be used later by the `PREV` function's `per` argument.

3.  **`month_level_partition_for_ticker`**:
    *   This operates on the sub-collection of daily prices within each `ticker_level_group` (i.e., for each specific ticker).
    *   It further partitions this ticker-specific daily data by `year_field` and `month_field`.
    *   `name=""month_level_group""` names these monthly groups within each ticker.

4.  **`monthly_aggregates`**:
    *   `CALCULATE` is applied to `month_level_partition_for_ticker`. For each month within each ticker:
        *   It carries forward the `ticker_s_field` (as `ticker_symbol_val`), `year_field` (as `year_val`), and `month_field` (as `month_val`).
        *   It calculates the average closing price (`avg_close_val`), maximum high price (`max_high_val`), and minimum low price (`min_low_val`) for that month using aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) on the corresponding fields from `daily_prices_enhanced` that fall into the current month's group.

5.  **`results_with_momc`**:
    *   This `CALCULATE` is applied to the `monthly_aggregates` (which contains one row per ticker per month with monthly stats).
    *   It selects and renames the ticker symbol, formats the month string as ""YYYY-MM"" (`month_output_str`), and includes the calculated monthly aggregates.
    *   Crucially, it calculates `prev_month_avg_close` using the `PREV` window function:
        *   `PREV(avg_close_val, ...)` gets the `avg_close_val` from the previous row.
        *   `by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC())` ensures rows are ordered chronologically before `PREV` is applied.
        *   `per=""ticker_level_group""` is essential: it tells `PREV` to reset its calculation for each new ticker group (defined by `ticker_group_partition`). This ensures the ""previous month"" is correctly identified within the same ticker.
        *   `default=None` handles the first month for each ticker, where there's no previous month.
    *   It then calculates `momc_calc` using the formula `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`. `IFF` is used to handle cases where `prev_month_avg_close` is `None` (first month) or zero (to prevent division by zero errors), returning `None` in such scenarios.

6.  **`final_report`**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`, and `MoMC`.

1.  `customer_join_month_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:

        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions where the transaction's month matches the customer's join month AND the transaction's year matches the customer's join year are considered.

    -   `total_amount_calc=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions linked to the current ticker via the `transactions_of` relationship. This sum is stored in `total_amount_calc`.

-   `.TOP_K(10, by=total_amount_calc.DESC())`: This function takes the result of the previous `CALCULATE` step (a collection of tickers with their calculated total amounts and transaction counts) and selects the top 10 tickers. The selection is based on `total_amount_calc` in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning tickers with higher total transaction amounts will rank higher.
-   `.CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=ticker_s, ...)`: This final `CALCULATE` step formats the output from the `TOP_K` operation.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields:
    *   `cust_state`: This is derived from `customer.state`, accessing the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
    *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, accessing the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `transaction_details.PARTITION(name=""state_ticker_combinations"", by=(cust_state, tick_type))`: We then partition the `transaction_details` collection.
    *   `name=""state_ticker_combinations""`: Assigns a name to the partitioned groups.
    *   `by=(cust_state, tick_type)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: After partitioning, we perform a calculation for each group:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the customer state (which is one of the partition keys).
    *   `ticker_type=tick_type`: Selects the ticker type (the other partition key).
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions belonging to the current group (combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`).

4.  `.TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())`: Finally, we select the top 5 combinations.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 results.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We use the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
2.  `lowest_closing_price=MIN(...)`: This defines the output field `lowest_closing_price` and assigns it the minimum value of the expression that follows.
3.  `DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This starts with the `DailyPrices` collection and filters it based on conditions.
4.  `(ticker.symbol == ""VTI"")`: This condition filters for records where the `symbol` of the associated `ticker` is ""VTI"".
5.  `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters for records within the last 7 days (today and the 6 previous days).
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current date.
    *   `<= 6` ensures that we include records from today (0 days difference) up to 6 full days ago.
6.  `.close`: After filtering, `.close` accesses the closing prices of the selected `DailyPrices` records.
7.  `MIN(...)`: This aggregation function then finds the minimum value among these closing prices.

1.  First, we filter the `Customers` collection to get only those customers whose `join_date` is within the last 70 days from the current date. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this.
2.  From this filtered set of customers, we access their `transactions_made`.

    *   `<= 70` ensures we only select customers who joined 70 days ago or more recently.
2.  `.transactions_made`: After filtering the customers, this accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection for all these recent customers. This results in a collection of all transactions made by them.
3.  `transactions_from_recent_customers = ...`: The resulting collection of transactions is assigned to the variable `transactions_from_recent_customers`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Selects transactions from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions in January, February, or March (the first quarter).
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only transactions marked as ""successful"".
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: For each filtered transaction, a new field `transaction_month` is created, storing the month of the transaction. The original `price` field of these transactions is implicitly available for subsequent operations.

2.  `monthly_avg_transaction_price_q1_2023 = q1_2023_successful_transactions.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered transactions and groups them.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month))`: Groups the `q1_2023_successful_transactions` by the `transaction_month` field. Each group (partition) will contain all successful transactions from a specific month in Q1 2023.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This is applied to each monthly group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month (which is the key of the current partition) for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to the original `Transactions` collection that fall within the current month's partition.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result set by month in ascending order (e.g., January, then February, then March).

The final variable `monthly_avg_transaction_price_q1_2023` will contain a table with two columns: `month` (1, 2, or 3) and `average_transaction_price` for that month in Q1 2023.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the relevant time window.
    *   Calculate the start of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   From this, determine the start date of the oldest week in our range (8 weeks prior to the current week, so 56 days before the start of the current week) and the start date of the most recent week in our range (last week, so 7 days before the start of the current week). These will be `v_min_target_week_start` and `v_max_target_week_start`.

2.  **Filter Sales and Access Payments**:
    *   Start with the `Dealership` collection to access global values like the calculated date boundaries.
    *   Navigate to `Sales` records and filter for those with `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   Access the `payment` sub-collection for these sales, which contains `PaymentsReceived` records.

3.  **Process Each Payment**: For each payment associated with the filtered sales:
    *   Calculate `v_payment_week_start`: the start date of the week in which the payment occurred, using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   Calculate `v_is_weekend_int`: a flag (1 if the payment was on a weekend, 0 otherwise). This is done using `IFF(ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")), 1, 0)`.

4.  **Filter Payments by Time Window**:
    *   Filter the processed payments to include only those where `v_payment_week_start` falls within our defined 8-week window (i.e., `v_payment_week_start >= v_min_target_week_start` and `v_payment_week_start <= v_max_target_week_start`).

5.  **Group and Aggregate Payments**:
    *   Partition the filtered payments by `v_payment_week_start`. This groups all payments by the week they occurred in.
    *   For each week (each partition group):
        *   `week`: The start date of the week (`v_payment_week_start`).
        *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments in that week, using `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`.
        *   `weekend_payments_received`: The sum of `v_is_weekend_int` for payments in that week, effectively counting the weekend payments.

1.  First, we define a collection `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days` by filtering the `Sales` collection.
    *   We select sales where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
    *   We further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved using the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (obtained via `DATETIME('now')`). The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29)` ensures that the sale occurred between 0 and 29 days ago (inclusive), covering a 30-day period.

2.  Next, we use the top-level `Dealership` collection to perform a `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `number_of_toyota_sales`: We count the number of records in our filtered `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days` collection using `COUNT()`.
    *   `total_revenue_from_toyota_sales`: We sum the `sale_price` for all sales in the `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days` collection using `SUM()`.

This will result in a single record containing the total count of relevant sales and their combined revenue.

    *   `number_of_sales`: The count of sales they made.
3.  Calculate `SR` (Sales Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking should be based on `total_sales_amount` in descending order. We'll use `allow_ties=True` so that salespersons with the same total sales amount receive the same rank, which is a common interpretation of ""rank"".

*   `total_sales_amount=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their associated records in the `sales_made` sub-collection. If a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.
*   `number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: This counts the number of sales for each salesperson from their `sales_made` sub-collection. If a salesperson has no sales, this count will be 0.
*   `SR=RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson.
    *   `by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC()`: The ranking is determined by the total sales amount (calculated as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`) in descending order (highest sales get lower rank numbers).
    *   `allow_ties=True`: This ensures that if multiple salespersons have the same total sales amount, they will receive the same rank (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code determines the highest sale price for each make and model of cars that have been sold and are confirmed to be no longer in inventory based on their latest status.

1.  **Filter Relevant Cars (`cars_meeting_criteria`):**
    *   It starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters cars based on three conditions:
        *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: Ensures the car has at least one sale record, meaning it has been sold.
        *   `HAS(inventory_snapshots) == 1`: Ensures the car has inventory snapshot records, which are necessary to determine its current inventory status.
        *   The car's most recent inventory status must be 'not in inventory'. This is determined by:
            *   Accessing the car's `inventory_snapshots`.
            *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`: This selects the inventory snapshot record with the most recent `snapshot_date` for that specific car. The `per=""Cars""` ensures the ranking is done individually for each car.
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the single resulting snapshot record into an accessible context.
            *   `.is_in_inventory == False`: Checks if the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot is `False`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then creates aliases `car_mk` for `make` and `car_mdl` for `model`. These aliases are used as keys for partitioning. The `sale_records` associated with each car are implicitly available for later aggregation.

2.  **Group by Make and Model and Calculate Highest Sale Price (`grouped_by_make_model`):**
    *   The `cars_meeting_criteria` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""make_model_group"", by=(car_mk, car_mdl))`. This groups the cars by each unique combination of make (`car_mk`) and model (`car_mdl`).
    *   For each group, a `CALCULATE` clause computes:
        *   `make=car_mk`: The make of the current group.
        *   `model=car_mdl`: The model of the current group.
        *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the maximum `sale_price` from all `sale_records` associated with the cars within the current make-model partition group. Here, `Cars` refers to the subset of cars from `cars_meeting_criteria` that belong to this specific group.

3.  **Order Results (`result`):**
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())` sorts the make-model groups in descending order based on their calculated `highest_sale_price`.
    *   The final ordered list of makes, models, and their corresponding highest sale prices is assigned to the `result` variable.",94.02375197410583,"# Step 1: Filter cars to include only those that have been sold, have inventory snapshots,

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Cars` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   The condition `(LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%""))` filters for cars where:
        *   The lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"" (e.g., ""Ford"", ""FORD"", ""BigFord Co""). The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches.
        *   OR, the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"" (e.g., ""Mustang"", ""MUSTANG GT"").
    *   `LOWER()` is used on `make` and `model` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each car that matches the filter criteria, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   `make=make`: Selects the car's make.
    *   `model=model`: Selects the car's model.
    *   `year=year`: Selects the car's year.
    *   `color=color`: Selects the car's color.
    *   `vin_number=vin_number`: Selects the car's VIN number.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the average sale price for the car.
        *   `sale_records` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each car.
        *   `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)` computes the average of the `sale_price` from all sale records associated with that specific car. If a car has no sale records, this average will typically be null.

This calculation is for the last 6 months, excluding the current month. The results should include all months within this period that had any sales activity, showing 0 for PMSPS/PMSR if no sales were made by the target salespersons in such a month. The output should be ordered by month.

Here's the breakdown of the PyDough code:

1.  **Define Time Period**: We establish the start and end dates for the 6-month window.
    *   `start_date_boundary`: The first day of the month, 6 months ago.
    *   `end_date_boundary`: The first day of the current month (making the period exclusive of the current month).

2.  **Prepare Sales Data**:
    *   Filter `Sales` to include only those within the defined 6-month period.
    *   In a `CALCULATE` step, we create:
        *   `sale_year_month_str`: A string representation of the sale's year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") for grouping.
        *   `sale_price_val`: The sale price, to be summed for PMSR.
        *   `salesperson_hire_year_val`: The year the salesperson associated with the sale was hired. This is used to filter for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023.
        *   `sale_identifier`: The ID of the sale, used for counting unique sales for PMSPS.

3.  **Partition by Month**:
    *   The prepared sales data is then partitioned by `sale_year_month_str` using `PARTITION(name=""sales_per_month_group"", by=(sale_year_month_str))`. This groups all sales by their year-month.

4.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**:
    *   For each month partition, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `month`: The year-month string.
        *   `relevant_sales_this_month`: We filter the sales within the current month's partition (`sales_per_month_group.Sales`) to include only those made by salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023 (using `salesperson_hire_year_val`).
        *   `PMSPS`: Calculated by `COUNT(relevant_sales_this_month.sale_identifier)`. If no relevant sales occurred, this will be 0.
        *   `PMSR`: Calculated by `SUM(relevant_sales_this_month.sale_price_val)`. If no relevant sales occurred, this will be 0.

5.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month` in ascending order.

This approach ensures that if a month within the 6-month window had any sales activity (even if not by the target salespersons), it will appear in the results. If the target salespersons had no sales in such a month, PMSPS and PMSR for that month will correctly be 0. Months with no sales activity at all during the period will not be generated by this partitioning approach.

1. Access the `Sales` collection.
2. Filter these sales to include only those made in the first quarter (January, February, March) of 2023.
3. Calculate the average of the `sale_price` for the filtered sales.

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated result.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- `AVG(Sales.WHERE(...).sale_price)` calculates the average sale price.
- `Sales.WHERE(...)` filters the sales:

3.  Compute the average of these day differences across all payment records using the `AVG` aggregation function.

1.  Calculate the total revenue from car sales in 2023. This is the sum of `sale_price` for all sales where the `sale_date` is in 2023.
2.  Calculate the total cost of cars sold in 2023. This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales in 2023.
3.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
4.  Handle the case where total cost might be zero to avoid division by zero errors.

The query starts from the `Dealership` (top-level) collection to compute these global aggregates.

```python

    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

    )
)
```
Explanation:
1.  The first `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` collection computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_2023`: It filters the `Sales` collection for records where the year of `sale_date` is 2023. Then, it sums the `sale_price` of these filtered sales.
    *   `total_cost_2023`: Similarly, it filters `Sales` for 2023 and then accesses the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale using `Sales.car.cost`. It then sums these costs.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` takes these two aggregated values (`total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`) and computes the `gpm_2023`.
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `total_cost_2023` is not zero.
    *   If `total_cost_2023` is not zero, it calculates GPM using the formula `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures a floating-point result for the percentage.
    *   If `total_cost_2023` is zero (to prevent division by zero), it assigns `0.0` to `gpm_2023`. This value might be adjusted based on specific business requirements for handling undefined GPM.
The final result `gpm_calculation_2023` will be a collection with a single row and a single column `gpm_2023` representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",26.258604526519775,"gpm_calculation_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as we are interested in sale prices and sale dates.
2.  For each sale, we need information about the car (make, model) and the sale itself (price, date). We use `CALCULATE` to make these fields available. Let's call the calculated sale date `the_sale_date` and sale price `the_price` to distinguish them.
3.  Filter these sales records. A sale is eligible if the car involved was marked as out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the *exact same day* as the sale (`snapshot_date == the_sale_date`).
    *   We access the car associated with the current sale using `Sales.car`.
    *   Then, we access its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection.
    *   We use a `WHERE` clause on these snapshots to find any that match `is_in_inventory == False` and `snapshot_date == the_sale_date` (where `the_sale_date` is the sale date of the current `Sales` record).
    *   The `HAS(...) == 1` function checks if at least one such inventory snapshot exists for the car on its sale date.
4.  From the filtered list of eligible sales, we use `TOP_K(1, by=the_price.DESC())` to find the single sale record that has the highest sale price.
5.  Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: `make`, `model`, and `sale_price`.

```python
result = Sales.CALCULATE(
    the_make = car.make,
    the_model = car.model,
    the_price = sale_price,
    the_sale_date = sale_date  # Calculate sale_date to be used in the sub-filter

).CALCULATE(
    make = the_make,
    model = the_model,
    sale_price = the_price
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each record in the `Sales` collection. For each sale, it retrieves the `make` and `model` of the associated car (`car.make`, `car.model`), the `sale_price`, and the `sale_date`. These are assigned to temporary variables `the_make`, `the_model`, `the_price`, and `the_sale_date`.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(Sales.car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1)`: This filters the sales records. A sale is kept if:
    *   `Sales.car.inventory_snapshots`: For the car involved in the current sale, it looks at its inventory snapshots.
    *   `.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == the_sale_date))`: It filters these snapshots to find any where the car was marked as not in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) and the `snapshot_date` matches `the_sale_date` (the date the car was sold).
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This condition is true if at least one such inventory snapshot exists, meaning the car went out of inventory on the same day it was sold.
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=the_price.DESC())`: From the sales that meet the criteria, this selects the single sale record with the highest `the_price`. If there are ties for the highest price, one will be chosen.
4.  `.CALCULATE(make = the_make, model = the_model, sale_price = the_price)`: This final step formats the output to include only the `make`, `model`, and `sale_price` from the top-ranked sale.",46.81373357772827,"result = Sales.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `payment_time_info`: We start by taking the `PaymentsReceived` collection and adding two new calculated fields: `pay_year` (the year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (the month of `payment_date`).
2.  `monthly_payment_summary`: This step takes `payment_time_info` and partitions it by `pay_year` and `pay_month`. For each unique year-month combination, it calculates:
    *   `actual_year`: The year of the group.
    *   `actual_month`: The month of the group.
    *   `total_payments_for_month`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values within that year-month group. This uses `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)` to aggregate from the original `PaymentsReceived` data that falls into the current partition group.
3.  `final_monthly_report`: This final step takes the `monthly_payment_summary` (which contains one row per year/month with total payments) and calculates the Month-over-Month change:
    *   `year_val`, `month_val`, `total_monthly_payments`: These fields are carried over from the previous step for the final output.
    *   `mom_change`: This is calculated as the `total_payments_for_month` of the current row minus the `total_payments_for_month` of the previous row. The `PREV` function is used to get this previous value.
        *   `by=(actual_year.ASC(), actual_month.ASC())`: This tells `PREV` to consider rows in ascending order of year, then month, to correctly identify the ""previous"" month.
        *   `default=0.0`: If there is no previous month (e.g., for the earliest month in the data), `PREV` will return `0.0`, so the MoM change for the first month will effectively be its total payments.",55.365708112716675,"# Step 1: Extract year and month from payment_date

1.  Access the `Sales` collection from the `Dealership` graph.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days (i.e., from 6 days ago up to and including today). We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this:

2.  `TSC=COUNT(...)`: This defines a field named `TSC` (Total Sales Count) in the output. Its value is determined by the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  `Dealership.Sales.WHERE(...)`: This accesses the `Sales` sub-collection of `Dealership` and applies a filter to it.
4.  `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6)`: This is the filtering condition applied to each sale:

In PyDough, we can achieve a similar result to a ""left join and filter for nulls"" by checking for the absence of related records in a sub-collection.

```python

    car_make=make,
    car_model=model,

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start by accessing the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    *   `sale_records` is the sub-collection within `Cars` that lists all sales associated with a particular car.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection is empty for each car.
    *   `== 1` (or simply `HASNOT(sale_records)`) ensures we only keep cars for which this condition is true (i.e., they have no sales records).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**: This selects and renames the desired fields for the cars that met the filter criteria.
    *   `car_id=_id`: Selects the `_id` field and renames it to `car_id`.

    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` field and renames it to `car_model`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Sales.PARTITION(name=""sales_by_customer"", by=(customer_id))`**:
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection, which contains records of all sales.
    *   The `PARTITION` method is used to group the sales records.
    *   `by=(customer_id)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `customer_id` field within each sale record. This creates groups where each group contains all sales made by a single, unique customer.
    *   `name=""sales_by_customer""` assigns a temporary name to these groups, though it's not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` in this specific query structure for distinct values.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)`**:
    *   After partitioning, `CALCULATE` is applied to each group (each unique customer).
    *   `customer_id=customer_id` selects the `customer_id` that defines the current group. Since each group corresponds to a unique `customer_id`, this effectively produces a collection where each record contains one distinct `customer_id` of a customer who has made at least one purchase.

We filter these sales to include only those made in the ""past 30 days"". The condition `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30` checks if the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp is less than 30 (covering a 30-day period ending today). `COUNT` then counts these filtered sales.
    *   `total_revenue_last_30_days=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30).sale_price)`: Similarly, we filter the sales for the last 30 days and then sum their `sale_price` to get the total revenue for that salesperson in that period.

1.  Group cars by their `make` and `model`.
2.  For each group (i.e., each unique car model), calculate the total revenue generated from all sales of cars of that model. Total revenue for a model is the sum of `sale_price` from all its `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by defining two key date boundaries at the `Dealership` (top) level.
    *   `start_of_current_iso_week`: Calculates the timestamp for Monday 00:00:00 of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_previous_iso_week`: Calculates the timestamp for Monday 00:00:00 of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.

2.  `payments_for_partitioning = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_of_previous_iso_week) & (payment_date < start_of_current_iso_week))`: This filters the payments to include only those that occurred during the previous ISO week. The range is inclusive of the `start_of_previous_iso_week` and exclusive of the `start_of_current_iso_week`, effectively covering Monday to Sunday of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(day_of_payment = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day'), p_method = payment_method)`:
        *   `day_of_payment`: For each filtered payment, this extracts just the date part (setting time to 00:00:00) from the `payment_date`. This is crucial for grouping payments by day, regardless of the time they occurred.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  For each of these sales, calculate two new attributes:
    *   `c_state`: The state of the customer who made the purchase, accessed via `customer.state`.
    *   `quarter_start_dt`: A string representing the first date of the quarter in which the sale occurred. This is determined using the month of the `sale_date`. For example, sales in January, February, or March will have `quarter_start_dt` as ""2023-01-01"".
3.  Partition these processed sales records by `c_state` and `quarter_start_dt`. This groups all sales by the customer's state and the specific quarter of 2023.
4.  For each group (i.e., for each state and quarter), calculate the sum of `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records within that group. This gives the total sales for that state in that quarter.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to retain only records where the sale occurred in the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for partitioning.

    *   `quarter_start_dt=IFF(...)`: This expression determines the first day of the quarter for each sale. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the `sale_date`:
        *   If the month is 1, 2, or 3, `quarter_start_dt` is ""2023-01-01"" (Q1).
        *   If the month is 4, 5, or 6, `quarter_start_dt` is ""2023-04-01"" (Q2).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation for each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  `drug_name=drug_name`: This selects the name of the drug.
3.  `avg_ddd=AVG(...)`: This calculates the average DDD for the current drug. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
4.  `treatments_used_in`: This accesses the list of treatments associated with the current drug.
5.  `.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`: This filters the treatments:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment has an end date, as specified by ""where end date is not null"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Calculates the duration of the treatment in days and ensures it's positive. This prevents division by zero or non-positive values when calculating DDD.
6.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the filter, this inner `CALCULATE` computes its individual DDD.
    *   `tot_drug_amt` is the total drug amount consumed for that specific treatment.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` is the duration of that treatment in days.
7.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This part extracts the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values from the collection of filtered and calculated treatments. This list of DDD values is then passed to the `AVG` function.

1.  **Define Dynamic Date Ranges**: First, we establish the date ranges for the three relevant months:
    *   One month ago (e.g., if ""now"" is July, this is June).
    *   Two months ago (e.g., May).
    *   Three months ago (e.g., April).
    We also create string labels for these months in ""YYYY-MM"" format. These definitions are made at a global level using `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` so they can be referenced downstream.

2.  **Augment and Filter Treatments**:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection.
    *   For each treatment, we determine which of the three defined monthly periods its `start_dt` falls into. A `period_label` (YYYY-MM string) is assigned if it matches one of the target months; otherwise, it's marked for exclusion.
    *   We also extract the `patient_id` (as `p_id`) and a boolean flag `is_biologic` indicating if the treatment used a drug of type 'biologic'.
    *   Treatments not falling into any of the three target months are filtered out.

3.  **Partition by Month**: The augmented and filtered treatments are then partitioned by the `period_label`. This creates groups of treatments for each of the three months.

4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `month`: The ""YYYY-MM"" label for the month.
    *   `patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct patient IDs (`NDISTINCT(p_id)`) among all treatments in that month's group. This gives the total number of unique patients treated in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct patient IDs for treatments that were flagged as `is_biologic`. This is done using `NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(p_id, is_biologic == True))`, which considers only patient IDs from biologic treatments for the distinct count.

5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in descending order (most recent of the three months first).

Explanation:
1.  `start_of_current_month_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This contextless expression defines the first moment of the current month. Treatments must have started *before* this date.

    For example, if today is November 15th, `start_of_current_month_val` would be November 1st. `start_of_target_period_val` would be May 1st. The query will count treatments from May 1st up to (but not including) November 1st.

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start by querying the `AdverseEvents` collection, as this is the primary source of the information we need.
2.  **`.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == 'topical')`**:
    *   We filter these adverse events.
    *   `treatment`: Each adverse event is linked to a specific treatment record.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to select and shape the output fields:
    *   `description=description`: Selects the `description` of the adverse event.
    *   `treatment_id=treatment_id`: Selects the `treatment_id` from the adverse event record (which links it to the `Treatments` table).

2.  **Group Doctors by Specialty**: Partition the doctors based on their `speciality`. This will create groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (more drugs prescribed means a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `RANKING` function's `per` parameter will be used to ensure ranking is done independently for each specialty group.

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_drug_data = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`: This line processes the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it selects their `doc_id` (renamed to `doc_id_val`), `speciality` (renamed to `speciality_val`), and calculates `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` by counting the distinct drug IDs found in their `prescribed_treatments`.

        *   `current_month_start_date`: The start of the current month. Treatments included in the analysis must have a `start_dt` *before* this date.
    *   This setup ensures we are looking at the 12 full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatments**:
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the defined 12-month window (`>= twelve_months_ago_start_date` and `< current_month_start_date`).
    *   `CALCULATE` then extracts the year (`treatment_year_val`) and month (`treatment_month_val`) from the `start_dt` of these filtered treatments. These values will be used for grouping. The `patient_id` field from the `Treatments` collection is implicitly carried forward.

3.  **Partition by Month and Calculate Metrics**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(treatment_year_val, treatment_month_val))` groups the prepared treatments by unique year-month combinations.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `year_month_str`: A formatted string representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-06"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `pmpd_count`: This is PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses). It's calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received at least one treatment (and thus an associated diagnosis) within that specific month.
        *   `pmtc_count`: This is PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count). It's calculated as `COUNT(Treatments)`, which counts the total number of treatments that occurred in that specific month.
    *   `ORDER_BY(treatment_year_val.ASC(), treatment_month_val.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically.

4.  **Final Output Selection**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `year_month`, `PMPD`, and `PMTC`.

1.  **Identify the First Treatment Year for Each Patient**:
    *   We start with the `Patients` collection.

    *   We then extract the year from this earliest date. This gives us `year_of_first_treatment` for each patient.
    *   Patients who have not received any treatments are filtered out using `HAS(treatments_received) == 1`.

2.  **Count New Patients per Year**:
    *   The data from step 1 (each patient and their first treatment year) is then partitioned by `year_of_first_treatment`.
    *   For each year in the partition, we count the number of unique patients (`p_id`) whose first treatment occurred in that year. This gives us `num_new_patients` for each year.
    *   The results are ordered by year to facilitate the next step.

3.  **Calculate NPI (New Patients Increase)**:
    *   For each year's count of new patients, we use the `PREV` window function to access the `num_new_patients` from the immediately preceding year.
    *   The NPI is calculated as: `current_year_num_new_patients - previous_year_num_new_patients`.

The calculation must only include outcomes where PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100 are non-null.

Here's the step-by-step derivation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Filter Valid Outcomes**: We first create a subset of `Outcomes` that only includes records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (non-null). We use `HASNOT(field_name) == 0` to check for non-null fields, as `HASNOT(field_name) == 1` indicates a field is null or absent.
2.  **Calculate Average Scores**: Using the filtered outcomes, we calculate the overall average of `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score`. This is done at the `DermTreatment` graph level to get global averages.
3.  **Apply D7D100PIR Formula**: We then apply the D7D100PIR formula using these calculated averages.
    *   To prevent division by zero if `avg_d7_score` is 0, we use the `IFF` function to return `None` in such cases.
    *   We multiply by `100.0` to ensure the result is a percentage and to maintain floating-point precision.
4.  **Return the Value**: The final result will be a single record in the `DermTreatment` context containing the calculated percentage value.

```python
# Step 1: Filter outcomes to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.
# HASNOT(field_name) == 0 checks if the field is present (not null).
valid_outcomes_for_pasi = Outcomes.WHERE(
    (HASNOT(day7_pasi_score) == 0) & (HASNOT(day100_pasi_score) == 0)

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`: This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. It keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (not null). The condition `(HASNOT(day7_pasi_score) == 0) & (HASNOT(day100_pasi_score) == 0)` achieves this, as `HASNOT(field) == 0` implies the field is not absent.
2.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the highest level of the graph (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `avg_d7_score = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
    *   `avg_d100_score = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step.
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = IFF(...)`: This computes the D7D100PIR.
        *   `IFF(avg_d7_score == 0, None, ...)`: This checks if `avg_d7_score` is zero. If it is, `None` (null) is returned to avoid division by zero errors.
        *   `(avg_d100_score - avg_d7_score) / avg_d7_score * 100.0`: If `avg_d7_score` is not zero, this part of the formula is executed. It calculates the improvement rate and multiplies by `100.0` to express it as a percentage and ensure floating-point arithmetic.

The final result, `overall_d7d100pir_calculation`, will be a collection containing a single row with one field, `d7d100pir_percentage`, representing the overall D7D100PIR.",54.219120025634766,"# Step 1: Filter outcomes to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field, `num_adverse_events_calc`. This field will store the count of adverse events that meet the specified criteria.
    *   To calculate this count, we first access the `treatments_used_in` for each drug.
    *   For each treatment, we determine its `start_dt`'s year and month. These are stored in temporary calculated fields `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth`.
    *   Then, we access the `adverse_events` associated with each of these treatments.
    *   We filter these adverse events, keeping only those where the `reported_dt` has the same year and month as the `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` of their parent treatment.
    *   The `COUNT` function then sums up all such filtered adverse events for the current drug.
3.  After calculating `num_adverse_events_calc` for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events_calc.DESC())` to select the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to format the output, selecting the `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and renaming `num_adverse_events_calc` to `number_of_adverse_events`.

We then need to return the top 5 insurance types, sorted by the lowest average PASI score.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Treatments**: We start by selecting only those treatments that ended in the year 2022. We also need the patient's insurance type for each of these treatments, as this will be our partitioning key.
2.  **Partition by Insurance Type**: We then group these filtered treatments by the `ins_type_for_partition` (derived from `patient.ins_type`).
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each insurance type group:
    *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: We calculate the average of `day100_pasi_score`. This score comes from the `outcome_records` associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group. The `AVG` function will consider all `day100_pasi_score` values from all outcome records of all relevant treatments within that group.
    *   `num_distinct_patients`: We count the number of unique patients associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`.
4.  **Sort and Select Top 5**: Finally, we sort these results by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (lowest first). We use `na_pos='last'` to ensure that any insurance types for which an average PASI score could not be calculated (resulting in a null) are placed at the end of the sort. We then select the top 5 records.

The resulting PyDough code is:

```python

    *   `calc_num_patients`: The number of distinct patients associated with treatments for this diagnosis. This is achieved by taking `NDISTINCT` of `patient_id` from the `patient` sub-collection of `treatments_for`.
    *   `calc_max_itch_score`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score found in the `outcome_records` associated with treatments for this diagnosis.
3.  Filter out diagnoses where `calc_max_itch_score` is null. This ensures that only diagnoses with valid scores are considered for the top ranking.
4.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calc_max_itch_score.DESC())` to select the top 3 diagnoses based on the `calc_max_itch_score` in descending order. If there are ties in the `calc_max_itch_score`, the ""number of distinct patients"" is not used as a secondary sort key by `TOP_K` based on the provided syntax, but it will be included in the final output.
5.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to present the results with the requested field names: `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score`.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):

3.  We also need to select the `drug_name`.
4.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 5 drugs. The primary sorting criterion for ""top 5"" will be `num_treatments` in descending order.

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three conditions:
    *   The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. We will use `LOWER()` and `CONTAINS()` for a case-insensitive substring match.
    *   The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We check this by ensuring the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field for the drug exists (is not null) using `HAS()`.
    *   The treatment's `end_dt` must be within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago and less than or equal to the current date. We use the `DATETIME()` function to achieve this.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the `DermTreatment` graph level to provide a single total.

```python
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    number_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(

**Explanation:**

*   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to calculate a single aggregate value.
*   `number_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(...)`: This defines the output field, which will be the count of treatments meeting the criteria.
*   `Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Treatments` collection.
*   `CONTAINS(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), 'psoriasis')`: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `diag_name` (from the linked `diagnosis` record) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. This handles the case-insensitive wildcard match for 'psoriasis'.
*   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the `drug` linked to the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function checks for the existence (non-nullness) of this field.
*   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This compound condition filters treatments based on their `end_dt`:
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` ensures the treatment ended on or after that date (i.e., within the last 6 months).
    *   `end_dt <= DATETIME('now')` ensures the treatment has actually ended by the current moment.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Target Registration Year**:
    *   `year_context = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(target_registration_year = MAX(Doctors.year_reg) - 2)`:
        This line first determines the latest `year_reg` among all doctors. It then subtracts 2 from this maximum year to define `target_registration_year`. This interprets ""2 years ago"" relative to the most recent registration data available.

2.  **Filter Doctors and Identify First Treatment**:
    *   `year_context.Doctors.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Doctors` collection within the context of `year_context` (making `target_registration_year` available).
    *   `WHERE((year_reg == target_registration_year) & (HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1))`: This filters the doctors to include only those:
        *   Whose `year_reg` matches the calculated `target_registration_year`.
        *   Who have at least one treatment record (`HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`). This ensures that a ""first treatment"" can be found.
    *   The first `.CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `doctor_last_name = last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
        *   `doctor_year_of_registration = year_reg`: Selects the doctor's registration year.
        *   `first_treatment_details = prescribed_treatments.TOP_K(1, by=start_dt.ASC()).SINGULAR()`: For each filtered doctor, this accesses their `prescribed_treatments`, orders them by `start_dt` (earliest first), takes the top one (the first treatment), and uses `.SINGULAR()` to make this single treatment record's fields accessible.

3.  **Select Final Output Fields**:
    *   The second `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step refines the output to include only the specifically requested fields.
        *   `last_name = doctor_last_name`: The doctor's last name.
        *   `year_of_registration = doctor_year_of_registration`: The doctor's registration year.
        *   `first_treatment_date = first_treatment_details.start_dt`: The `start_dt` of the first treatment.
        *   `first_treatment_id = first_treatment_details.treatment_id`: The `treatment_id` of the first treatment. The term ""_id"" in the request is interpreted as the primary identifier for a treatment, which is `treatment_id` in the `Treatments` collection.

We need to return the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates of each qualifying concomitant medication.

Here's how to construct the PyDough query:
1.  Start with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments to include only those where `is_placebo` is true.
3.  Access the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for these placebo treatments.
4.  Filter these `concomitant_meds` based on their `start_dt`. The condition is that the concomitant medication's start date must be on or after the treatment's start date and no more than 14 days after the treatment's start date. This can be checked using `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)`, which should be between 0 and 14 (inclusive). Here, `treatment.start_dt` refers to the start date of the parent treatment, and `start_dt` refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, for each concomitant medication that meets these criteria, use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields:
    *   `treatment_id` from the parent treatment.
    *   `start_dt` from the parent treatment.
    *   `end_dt` from the parent treatment.
    *   `start_dt` from the concomitant medication.
    *   `end_dt` from the concomitant medication.

This will result in a table where each row represents a concomitant medication that satisfies the timing condition, along with details of its parent placebo treatment.

```python
result = Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True).concomitant_meds.WHERE(
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) &

    med_start_datetime = start_dt,
    med_end_datetime = end_dt
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`: This selects all treatments from the `Treatments` collection that are marked as placebo treatments.
2.  `.concomitant_meds`: For each selected placebo treatment, this accesses its associated concomitant medications.
3.  `.WHERE((DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14))`: This filters the concomitant medications.
    *   `treatment.start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` of the current concomitant medication.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the treatment's start and the medication's start.
    *   The condition ensures that the medication started on the same day as the treatment or up to 14 days after the treatment started (i.e., within two weeks).
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each concomitant medication that passes the filter, this step selects and renames the required fields:
    *   `treatment_identifier = treatment.treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_datetime = treatment.start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.

3.  For these filtered patients, calculate their age in years by finding the difference between the current date and their `date_of_birth` using `DATEDIFF`.
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using `AVG`.
5.  Round the final average age to the nearest integer using `ROUND`.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions with `status == ""completed""` are successful. We'll look at `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Count the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This can be done by taking `NDISTINCT` of the `coupon_id` from the filtered transactions. `NDISTINCT` will handle cases where no coupon was used (null `coupon_id`) by not counting them.
4.  Count the total number of distinct successful transactions. This is `COUNT` of the filtered successful transactions.
5.  Calculate CPUR using the formula: `number of distinct coupons used / number of distinct successful transactions`.
6.  To prevent division by zero (if a merchant has no successful transactions), we'll use an `IFF` statement. If there are no successful transactions, CPUR will be 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts by iterating through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` clause:
    *   `merchant_name_temp = name`: The merchant's `name` is stored in a temporary variable `merchant_name_temp`.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons_used = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`: This calculates the number of unique coupons. It first filters the `transactions_received` by the merchant to include only those with `status == ""completed""`. Then, `NDISTINCT(coupon_id)` counts the unique `coupon_id` values from these successful transactions.
    *   `num_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`: This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant by filtering `transactions_received` for `status == ""completed""` and then applying `COUNT`.
    *   `CPUR_calculated = IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR. The `IFF` function checks if `num_successful_transactions` is greater than 0.
        *   If true, CPUR is `(1.0 * num_distinct_coupons_used) / num_successful_transactions`. Multiplying by `1.0` helps ensure floating-point division.
        *   If false (i.e., no successful transactions), CPUR is set to `0.0`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause is used to format the final output:
    *   `merchant_name = merchant_name_temp`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `CPUR = CPUR_calculated`: Selects the calculated CPUR and names the field `CPUR`.

How many wallet transactions were made by users from the US in the last 7 days inclusive of today? Return the number of transactions and total transaction amount.,"SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_transactions, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t JOIN users AS u ON t.sender_id = u.uid WHERE u.country = 'US' AND t.created_at >= DATE('now', '-7 days') AND t.created_at < DATE('now', '+1 day');",Ewallet,"The user wants to find out the number of ""wallet transactions"" and their total amount made by users from the ""US"" within the last 7 days, including today.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Identify US Users' Transactions**: We first need to filter the `Users` collection for those whose `country` is ""US"". Then, we access their sent transactions via the `transactions_sent` sub-collection.
2.  **Filter by Date**: For these transactions, we filter those where the `created_at` date falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This can be achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`.
    *   If a transaction was created today, `DATEDIFF` would be 0.
    *   If a transaction was created 6 days ago, `DATEDIFF` would be 6.
    *   These conditions satisfy `DATEDIFF <= 6`.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: Finally, we use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to compute the total count of these filtered transactions using `COUNT()` and the sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **""Wallet Transactions"" Assumption**: The term ""wallet transactions"" is not explicitly defined by a specific `transaction_type` in the problem. Therefore, we assume all transactions in the `Transactions` collection initiated by users are considered ""wallet transactions"".

```python
# Define a contextless expression for transactions made by US users in the last 7 days
filtered_transactions = Users.WHERE(country == ""US"").transactions_sent.WHERE(
    DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6
)

# Calculate the total number of these transactions and their total amount
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions),
    total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions.amount)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_transactions = Users.WHERE(country == ""US"").transactions_sent.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`:
    *   `Users.WHERE(country == ""US"")`: This selects all users whose `country` attribute is ""US"".
    *   `.transactions_sent`: From these US users, it accesses all transactions they have sent.
    *   `.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This filters the transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, ...)` calculates the difference in days between the transaction's creation date and now. The condition `<= 6` ensures we cover today (0 days diff) up to 6 days ago (6 days diff).

2.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This performs a calculation at the top `Ewallet` level, producing a single row of results.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions)`: This counts the total number of transactions that met the criteria defined in `filtered_transactions`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions.amount)`: This sums the `amount` field of all transactions that met the criteria, giving the total monetary value.",35.67496705055237,"# Define a contextless expression for transactions made by US users in the last 7 days

The definition provided for AMB is ""average balance per user (for the given time duration)"".

Here's how we can achieve this:
1.  Filter the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where `updated_at` falls within the last 7 days (today, yesterday, ..., up to and including 7 days ago).
2.  For these filtered balance records, group them by `user_id`.
3.  For each user, calculate their AMB by taking the average of their `balance` amounts from the records in their group. This aligns with ""average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". A user might have multiple balance entries if their balance was updated multiple times during the week; these will be averaged for that user.
4.  Finally, calculate the average of all these per-user AMBs. This will give the overall average AMB for wallets updated in the specified period.

The term ""AMB"" is defined in the query, and we will use that definition. The ""M"" for ""Monthly"" in a typical AMB context is superseded by ""for the given time duration,"" which is ""the past week"" here.

    *   This line starts with the `UserBalances` collection.
    *   It filters these records using a `WHERE` clause to keep only those balances that were `updated_at` within the last 7 days, inclusive. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the update time and now.

4. Report the user's identifier (e.g., `uid`) and this latest balance amount.

    user_uid=uid,

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(HAS(balances) == 1)`**:

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each user who passes the filter, we calculate new fields.

3.  **`user_uid=uid`**:
    *   We select the `uid` of the user and name it `user_uid`.

4.  **`LUB=balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1).SINGULAR().balance`**:
    *   This expression calculates the Latest User Balance (LUB).
    *   **`balances`**: Accesses the `balances` sub-collection for the current user. These are records from the `UserBalances` collection.
    *   **`.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**:
        *   This filters the balance entries for the current user to find the most recent one.
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: Ranks the balance entries.
            *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Orders the balances by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (most recent first).
            *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures that this ranking is performed independently for each user (i.e., the rank is reset for each user's set of balances).
        *   `== 1`: Selects only the balance entry that is ranked first (the most recent one).
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause is designed to return exactly one balance record (the latest), `SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record, allowing access to its fields.
    *   **`.balance`**: Extracts the `balance` amount from that single, most recent user balance record. This value is assigned to `LUB`.

1.  **`merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**:

    *   `calculated_revenue = SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   This calculates the total revenue for each merchant.
        *   It accesses `transactions_received`, which are transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
        *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where:
            *   `status == 'completed'` (successfully received).
            *   `receiver_type == 1` (confirming the transaction was intended for a merchant type receiver, as per the problem's filter requirement).
        *   `SUM(...)` then adds up the `amount` of these filtered transactions. If a merchant has no such transactions, this sum will typically be 0 or null.

2.  **`mrr_for_each_merchant = merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This takes the result from the previous step (`merchant_revenues_calc`).
    *   Another `CALCULATE` is used to finalize the output fields and compute the rank.
    *   `merchant_name = temp_merchant_name`: Assigns the merchant's name to the output field `merchant_name`.

    *   `current_month_start_date`: Marks the beginning of the current month. This is used as an exclusive end boundary for our period.
    *   `start_date_for_period`: Calculated as two months before `current_month_start_date`. This marks the inclusive start boundary. For example, if it's July, this period covers May and June.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`relevant_wallet_transactions`)**:
    *   The `Transactions` collection is filtered to include only records where:
        *   `created_at` falls within the defined date range (`start_date_for_period` to `current_month_start_date`).
        *   `sender_type` is `0`, as specified for wallet transactions relevant to PMDAU.

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`monthly_sender_activity`)**:
    *   A `CALCULATE` step transforms the filtered transactions:
        *   `activity_month`: The `created_at` timestamp is truncated to the first day of its month (e.g., ""2023-05-15"" becomes ""2023-05-01""). This will be used for grouping.
        *   `transaction_sender_id`: The `sender_id` is selected (and renamed for clarity) to be used for counting distinct senders.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`)**:
    *   `PARTITION(...)`: The `monthly_sender_activity` data is partitioned (grouped) by `activity_month`. Each partition, named `senders_per_month_group`, contains all activity for a specific month.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each month's partition:
        *   `year_and_month`: The `activity_month` (e.g., ""2023-05-01"") is selected as the identifier for the month.
        *   `pmdau`: The `NDISTINCT` function counts the number of unique `transaction_sender_id` values within the `senders_per_month_group` (i.e., for that specific month). This count represents the PMDAU for that month, according to the provided definition.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year_and_month.ASC())`: The final results are sorted by month in ascending order.

    *   `total_transaction_count=COUNT(transactions_sent)`: Counts the number of transactions in the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for each user. `transactions_sent` is a list of transactions sent by the user, and `COUNT()` is an aggregation function that correctly handles this plural sub-collection. The result is named `total_transaction_count`.

2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. We'll store this as `duration_in_seconds`.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `user_id`. This groups all sessions belonging to the same user.
4.  For each user group (partition), calculate the sum of `duration_in_seconds` to get the `total_duration`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `UserSessions` collection. It selects sessions where `session_start_ts` falls within the specified date range: from June 1, 2023, 00:00:00 (inclusive) up to, but not including, June 8, 2023, 00:00:00.
2.  `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id, duration_in_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, this calculates a new field `duration_in_seconds`. `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", ...)` computes the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds. The `user_id` is also carried forward.
3.  `sessions_filtered_with_duration.PARTITION(name=""user_sessions_group"", by=(user_id))`: This takes the records from the previous step (sessions with their individual durations) and groups them by `user_id`. Each group, named `user_sessions_group`, contains all sessions for a particular user.
4.  `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id, total_duration = SUM(user_sessions_group.duration_in_seconds))`: For each user group (partition), this calculates two fields:
    *   `user_id`: The ID of the user for that group.
    *   `total_duration`: The sum of `duration_in_seconds` for all sessions within that `user_sessions_group`. This gives the total session time for that user in the specified period.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_creation_details`: We first process the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, we use `CALCULATE` to extract their `mid` (aliased as `merchant_identifier`), `name` (aliased as `merchant_actual_name`), and derive their creation year (`merchant_creation_yr`) and month (`merchant_creation_mth`) from their `created_at` timestamp.
2.  `merchant_coupon_counts`: We then perform another `CALCULATE` on the result. For each merchant (with their derived creation year and month), we access their `coupons` sub-collection. We filter these coupons to include only those where the coupon's `created_at` year and month match the merchant's `merchant_creation_yr` and `merchant_creation_mth`. The `COUNT` function then counts how many such coupons exist for each merchant, storing this as `num_coupons_in_creation_month`.
3.  `top_merchant_by_coupons`: We use `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` to find the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
4.  `result`: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the record of the top merchant to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `mid`, `name`, and `num_coupons`.",34.006897926330566,"# Step 1: Extract merchant's ID, name, and their creation year and month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Users` collection and applying filters.
    *   **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters users whose country is 'US'. `LOWER(country)` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive as requested.
    *   **`HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`**: This condition checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: We look into the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `(notification_type == 'promotional')`: Filters for notifications that are 'promotional'.
        *   `(status == 'unread')`: Filters for notifications that have a status of 'unread'.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Ensures that only users who have one or more such notifications are included.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields.
    *   **`username=username`**: Selects the `username` of the user.
    *   **`total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`**: Calculates the total number of unread promotional notifications for each selected user.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the notifications.
        *   `notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`: This is the same filter applied inside `HAS` to ensure we are counting the correct set of notifications.

1.  Start with the `Coupons` collection, as each record here represents a coupon.
2.  For each coupon, we need to calculate:
    *   The coupon code itself (from the `code` field).
    *   The total number of redemptions: This can be found by counting the number of transactions associated with the coupon. The `Coupons` collection has a sub-collection `transaction_used_in` which lists these transactions. So, we'll use `COUNT(transaction_used_in)`.
    *   The total amount redeemed: This is the sum of the `amount` for all transactions where this coupon was used. We can calculate this using `SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`.
3.  These calculations will be done using the `CALCULATE` method.
4.  After calculating these values for all coupons, we use the `TOP_K` method to select the top 3 coupons. The ranking will be based on the `total_redemptions` in descending order.
5.  The final result will include the coupon code, total number of redemptions, and total amount redeemed for these top 3 coupons.

```python

).TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Coupons.CALCULATE(...)`: This part of the query operates on each coupon in the `Coupons` collection.
    *   `coupon_code=code`: Selects the coupon's code and names it `coupon_code` in the output.
    *   `total_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in)`: Counts the number of transactions linked to the current coupon via its `transaction_used_in` sub-collection. This count is named `total_redemptions`.
    *   `total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field from all transactions linked to the current coupon. This sum is named `total_amount_redeemed`.
*   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())`: This method takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of coupons, each with the newly calculated fields) and selects the top 3 records.
    *   `3`: Specifies that we want the top 3 records.
    *   `by=total_redemptions.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_redemptions` field, in descending order (highest number of redemptions first).

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions where `sender_type` is 0, indicating the sender was a user.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we use `CALCULATE` to create a new set of fields:
    *   `country_of_sender`: The country of the user who sent the transaction, obtained via `sending_user.country`.
    *   `sender_user_id_val`: The unique ID of the sending user, obtained via `sending_user.uid`. This is used for counting distinct users.
    *   `tx_amount_val`: The `amount` of the transaction. Renaming helps clarify its use in subsequent calculations.
3.  Next, we `PARTITION` these `enriched_transactions` by `country_of_sender`. This groups all transactions based on the country of the sending user.
4.  For each country group created by the partition, we `CALCULATE` the aggregate values:
    *   `country`: This is the `country_of_sender` (the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_senders`: The number of unique users who sent transactions from this country. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT` on the `sender_user_id_val` field from the `enriched_transactions` within the current country partition.
    *   `total_amount_sent`: The sum of all transaction amounts (`tx_amount_val`) sent from this country. This is calculated using `SUM` on the `tx_amount_val` field from the `enriched_transactions` within the current country partition.
5.  Finally, we apply `TOP_K(5, by=total_amount_sent.DESC())` to the `country_summary`. This selects the top 5 countries based on the `total_amount_sent`, ordered in descending order.

2.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
3.  Filter these merchants using `WHERE(HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(recent_merchant_transactions_filter)) == 1)`. This ensures that we only consider merchants who have at least one transaction matching our defined filter. This pre-filtering step improves efficiency.
4.  Use the `CALCULATE` method to compute the required information for each of these merchants:

3.  For each of these filtered merchants, access their `balances` sub-collection. Since `balances` is a list and could potentially contain historical balance records, we need to identify the most current balance entry. We achieve this by using the `RANKING` function, ordering the balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order, partitioned per merchant (`per=""Merchants""`). We select the entry ranked as 1 (the latest).
4.  This gives us a collection of the most recent `MerchantBalance` records, one for each qualifying merchant.

1.  Define a contextless expression `earliest_coupon` to find the coupon with the earliest `start_date` for a given merchant. We use `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())` to get the single earliest coupon and `SINGULAR()` to treat it as a singular record, allowing access to its fields like `cid` and `start_date`.
2.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
3.  Filter out merchants who have no coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
4.  Use `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `merchant_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `registration_date`.
    *   The ID (`cid`) of the earliest coupon as `earliest_coupon_id`, using the `earliest_coupon` expression.
    *   The start date (`start_date`) of the earliest coupon as `earliest_coupon_start_date`, also using the `earliest_coupon` expression.
5.  Use a subsequent `WHERE` clause to filter these records. The condition ensures that the `earliest_coupon_start_date` is:
    *   On or after the `registration_date`.
    *   On or before one year after the `registration_date`. We use `DATETIME(registration_date, '1 year')` to calculate the date one year after registration.

This approach ensures we only consider merchants with coupons and correctly identifies those whose first coupon was offered within their first year of operation.

1.  Access the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we check their `notifications` sub-collection.
3.  A user is selected if they have no notifications that were created on or before the date marking one year after their signup date (`Users.created_at`).
    *   The date one year after signup is calculated using `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`.
    *   We filter the `notifications` to find any that occurred within this first year: `notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`.
    *   The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check if this filtered set of early notifications is empty. If it's empty, it means the user either had no notifications at all, or all their notifications occurred after their first year.
4.  Finally, for the users who meet this condition, we select their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`).

```python
users_no_early_notification = Users.WHERE(
    HASNOT(
        notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))
    ) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    username=username,
    email=email,
    signup_date=created_at
)
```
**Explanation:**

*   `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
*   `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This is the core condition. It checks if a user does *not* have any notifications meeting the criteria specified in the inner `WHERE` clause.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`: This filters a user's notifications to include only those whose `created_at` timestamp is less than or equal to one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp (signup date).
        *   `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`: This function calculates the timestamp exactly one year after the user's signup date. `Users.created_at` here refers to the `created_at` field of the current user being evaluated. The inner `created_at` refers to `Notifications.created_at`.
*   If the result of `notifications.WHERE(...)` is an empty collection (meaning no notifications were found within the first year), `HASNOT` will be true, and the user will be included.
*   `.CALCULATE(username=username, email=email, signup_date=created_at)`: For the users who satisfy the condition, this part selects their `username`, `email`, and their original `created_at` field, which is aliased as `signup_date` in the output.",34.72108054161072,"users_no_early_notification = Users.WHERE(
