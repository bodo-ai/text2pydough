**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to include only those customers who have a total transaction count (`COUNT(transactions_made)`) of 5 or more.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates the required output fields:
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate=...`: Calculates the success rate. It does this by:
        *   Counting the number of transactions associated with the customer where the `status` field is exactly 'Completed' (`COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'Completed'))`). *Note: This assumes 'Completed' signifies a successful transaction.*
        *   Counting the total number of transactions for the customer (`COUNT(transactions_made)`).
        *   Dividing the count of successful transactions by the total count. Multiplying by `1.0` ensures the result is a floating-point number representing the rate.
3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection of customers and their success rates based on the calculated `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest success rate to highest).
4.  **`result = ordered_success_rates`**: The final ordered result is assigned to the variable `result`.",20.797606706619263,"# Filter customers who have made at least 5 transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This makes the query easier to read and maintain.
2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
4.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`**: This condition checks if a customer has at least one (`== 1`) transaction (`transactions_made`) that meets a sub-condition.
5.  **`transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`**: This sub-condition filters the customer's transactions, keeping only those where the `symbol` of the associated `ticker` is present (`ISIN`) in the `faang_tickers` list.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:** We first establish the date range using `DATETIME`. `current_week_start_date` marks the beginning of the current week, and `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` marks the beginning of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week's start.
2.  **Filter Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply filters:
    *   `ticker.ticker_type == 'stock'`: Ensures we only consider transactions related to stocks by checking the `ticker_type` of the associated `ticker`.
    *   `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week') >= eight_weeks_ago_start_date`: Includes transactions from the week starting 8 weeks ago onwards.
    *   `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week') < current_week_start_date`: Excludes transactions from the current week.
3.  **Calculate Week Info:** Within the filtered set (`transactions_in_period`), we use `CALCULATE` to determine:
    *   `week_start`: The starting date of the week for each transaction using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
    *   `day_name`: The name of the day (e.g., ""Saturday"") for each transaction using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.
4.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` to group the `transactions_in_period` data by the calculated `week_start` date. Each group (`weekly_groups`) represents a unique week within our 8-week timeframe.
5.  **Aggregate Weekly Counts:** Inside the `CALCULATE` following the `PARTITION`, we compute the required counts for each week:
    *   `week_starting`: Selects the `week_start` date for identification.
    *   `total_stock_transactions`: Counts all transactions within that specific week's group using `COUNT(transactions_in_period)`.
    *   `weekend_stock_transactions`: Counts only the transactions within that week's group where the `day_name` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using `COUNT(transactions_in_period.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.
6.  **Order Results:** The `ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())` clause sorts the final results chronologically by the week's starting date.
7.  **Assign Result:** The final result set is assigned to the `result` variable.",38.36280655860901,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the week 8 weeks prior

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection to define two date boundaries using the `DATETIME` function:
    *   `start_of_current_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., last Sunday or Monday at 00:00:00, depending on system configuration).
    *   `start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
2.  **`last_week_usa_transactions = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Transactions` collection from the context where the date boundaries are defined. We then apply a `WHERE` filter to select transactions that meet two conditions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Filters for transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week) & (date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Filters for transactions whose `date_time` falls within the calculated range for last week (from the start of last week up to, but not including, the start of the current week).
3.  **`result = date_boundaries.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we perform another `CALCULATE` at the `Broker` level to aggregate the results from the filtered `last_week_usa_transactions`:
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(last_week_usa_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions in the filtered set.
    *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(last_week_usa_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all transactions in the filtered set.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window:**
    *   `start_date_cutoff`: Calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the month, exactly 6 months before the current month begins (e.g., if run in July, this would be January 1st).
    *   `end_date_cutoff`: Calculates the date corresponding to the first day of the *current* month (e.g., if run in July, this would be July 1st).
2.  **Filter Customers:**
    *   `Customers.WHERE(...)`: Selects only those customers whose `join_date` is on or after `start_date_cutoff` AND strictly before `end_date_cutoff`. This effectively captures customers who joined in the 6 full months prior to the current month.
3.  **Calculate Signup Month:**
    *   `recent_customers.CALCULATE(...)`: For the filtered customers, a new field `signup_year_month` is created by concatenating the year and the zero-padded month from their `join_date`, resulting in a 'YYYY-MM' format string. `LPAD` ensures months like '5' become '05'.
4.  **Partition by Signup Month:**
    *   `customers_with_signup_month.PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(signup_year_month))`: Groups the customers based on the `signup_year_month` calculated in the previous step. Each partition (`monthly_groups`) contains customers who signed up in the same year and month.
5.  **Calculate Metrics (PMCS & PMAT):**
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Operates on each partition (each month group).
        *   `signup_month=signup_year_month`: Selects the grouping key (the signup month).
        *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: Calculates the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` records within the current partition (month group).
        *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the Per Month Average Transaction amount (PMAT) by navigating from the `Customers` in the current partition to their `transactions_made` and calculating the average of the `amount` field across all those transactions.
6.  **Order Results:**
    *   `.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically based on the signup month.
7.  **Assign Result:**
    *   `result = monthly_metrics`: Assigns the computed monthly metrics to the final `result` variable.",25.867722034454346,"# Define the start and end dates for the 6-month window preceding the current month

# Assign the final result to a variable

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_prices_info = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  **`WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') <= 6)`**: This filters the daily prices to include only records where the date is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current moment (`now`). A value of 0 means today, 1 means yesterday, and so on, up to 6 for six days ago.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(close_price=close, ticker_type=ticker.ticker_type)`**: For the filtered records, we calculate (or select) the `close` price (aliased as `close_price` for clarity, though not strictly necessary here) and retrieve the `ticker_type` by navigating the relationship `ticker` to the corresponding `Tickers` record. This makes `ticker_type` available as a field for partitioning.
4.  **`recent_prices_info.PARTITION(name=""type_group"", by=(ticker_type))`**: We partition the intermediate `recent_prices_info` collection. The data is grouped based on the unique values of the `ticker_type` field calculated in the previous step. Each group is conceptually named `type_group`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_type=ticker_type, ACP=AVG(DailyPrices.close))`**: For each partition (i.e., for each `ticker_type`):
    *   `ticker_type=ticker_type`: We select the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP=AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: We calculate the Average Closing Price (ACP) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `close` field of the `DailyPrices` records belonging to that specific `ticker_type` group (within the date filter applied earlier).
6.  **`result = ticker_type_acp`**: The final result, containing each `ticker_type` and its calculated `ACP` over the specified period, is assigned to the `result` variable.",24.165159702301025,"# Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_filtered`**: This selects customers who meet two criteria:
    *   Their `join_date` falls within the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`).
    *   They have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This ensures we only consider customers relevant to the AR calculation as defined.
2.  **`country_groups`**: This partitions the `customers_filtered` collection into groups based on the `country` field. Each group represents a unique country containing customers who joined in 2022 and have transactions.
3.  **`country_stats`**: This calculates statistics for each country group created by the partition:
    *   `country_name`: Retrieves the country name (the partition key).
    *   `total_customers_with_transactions`: Counts all customers within the current country group (these are the customers filtered in the first step). This serves as the denominator for the AR.
    *   `active_customers_with_transactions`: Counts only the customers within the current country group whose `status` is 'Active'. This serves as the numerator for the AR.
4.  **`result`**: This performs the final calculation and selects the desired output fields:
    *   `country`: Renames `country_name` to `country`.
    *   `AR`: Calculates the Activity Ratio using the formula provided: `(active_customers_with_transactions / total_customers_with_transactions) * 100.0`. The `100.0` ensures floating-point division for a percentage result. An `IFF` statement is included as a safeguard against division by zero, assigning an AR of 0.0 if `total_customers_with_transactions` were somehow zero (though the initial `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` filter makes this unlikely).",27.885735511779785,"# Filter customers who joined in 2022 and have made at least one transaction

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count). `CALCULATE` is used to compute this single value.
2.  **`num_customers = COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_customers` in our result. Its value is determined by the `COUNT` function, which counts the number of records in the collection provided to it.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We provide the `Customers` collection to `COUNT`, but first, we filter it using `WHERE` to only include customers who meet the specified criteria.
4.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This is the first part of the filter condition.
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   The `|` (OR) operator combines these two checks, so a customer matches if *either* condition is true.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This is the second part of the filter condition.
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the customer's state to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
6.  **`&`**: The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition and the state condition. A customer is only included in the final count if *both* the name condition (starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez') AND the state condition (ends with 'a') are true.
