**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by selecting the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer who meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"".
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the results (customers with their names and success rates) are ordered by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).",19.3624050617218,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  `faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_who_bought_faang = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the relevant 8-week period. This period starts 56 days (8 weeks) before the beginning of the current week and ends just before the current week begins.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that:
    *   Are for ""stock"" tickers. We'll assume the `ticker_type` field in the `Tickers` collection is 'stock' for this purpose.
    *   Fall within the defined 8-week time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected transaction, we calculate a standardized week identifier (`week_start_iso`). This is the start date of the week the transaction belongs to, formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD"" for clear grouping and sorting.
4.  **Group by Week**: We partition (group) these transactions by the `week_start_iso`.
5.  **Calculate Counts per Week**: For each week group:
    *   `total_stock_txns`: We count all transactions belonging to that group.
    *   `weekend_stock_txns`: We count transactions within that group where the `date_time` falls on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", determined using the `DAYNAME()` function.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by the week identifier in descending order, showing the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `start_of_current_week` and `eight_weeks_ago_from_start_of_current_week`: These lines define the boundaries for our 8-week analysis period, ensuring we exclude the current week.
2.  `transactions_for_partitioning`:
    *   This variable holds transactions that meet our initial criteria:
        *   `Transactions.ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Filters for transactions related to stocks. (Note: The actual value for 'stock' in `ticker_type` might vary, e.g., ""STK"", ""Equity"". ""stock"" is assumed here).
        *   The `date_time` conditions ensure transactions are within the desired 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these transactions, it computes `week_start_iso`.
        *   `DATETIME(Transactions.date_time, 'start of week')` truncates the transaction's timestamp to the start of its week.
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` are used to format this week-start-date into a ""YYYY-MM-DD"" string, which serves as a unique identifier for each week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=(week_start_iso))`: This groups the `transactions_for_partitioning` by the `week_start_iso`. Each group represents one of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = week_start_iso`: Selects the week identifier.
        *   `total_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions within that specific week's group. `Transactions` here refers to the records from the base `Transactions` collection that fall into the current partition group and meet the initial filtering criteria.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(Transactions.date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts transactions within the current week's group where the `DAYNAME()` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.DESC())`: Sorts the weekly summaries, showing the most recent week first.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries for ""Last Week""**: We use contextless expressions and the `DATETIME` function to define the start of the current week and the start of last week. ""Last week"" is the period from the start of last week (inclusive) up to the start of the current week (exclusive).
    *   `start_of_current_week_expr`: Calculated as the beginning of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_last_week_expr`: Calculated by subtracting 7 days from `start_of_current_week_expr`.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We create a contextless expression `filtered_us_transactions_last_week` that represents the set of transactions meeting all criteria:
    *   The transaction must be associated with a customer whose `country` is ""USA"". This is checked via `customer.country == ""USA""`.
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must be greater than or equal to `start_of_last_week_expr`.
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must be less than `start_of_current_week_expr`.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: We use `Broker.CALCULATE` (the top-level collection) to compute the final aggregates from the `filtered_us_transactions_last_week`:
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of transactions in the filtered set, obtained using `COUNT(filtered_us_transactions_last_week)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions in the filtered set, obtained using `SUM(filtered_us_transactions_last_week.amount)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to compute new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Include the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.
        *   `cr=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (`cr`). The `RANKING` function is used here:
            *   `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()`: Ranks customers based on their `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1).

What are the 2 most frequently bought stock ticker symbols in the past 10 days?

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions of type ""buy"" that occurred within the last 10 days from the current date. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  For these filtered transactions, we use `CALCULATE` to extract the `symbol` from the related `ticker` object and assign it to a new field `ticker_sym`. This makes the ticker symbol available for partitioning.
3.  We then `PARTITION` the resulting collection by the `ticker_sym`. This groups all relevant buy transactions by their stock ticker symbol.
4.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Output the `ticker_symbol` (which is the `ticker_sym` partition key).
    *   Count the number of transactions within that group using `COUNT(Transactions)`, naming this count `num_of_buy_transactions`.
5.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_of_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain up to 2 rows, each with the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding `num_of_buy_transactions`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two dynamic date boundaries using the `Broker` (high-level graph) context. `report_end_date` is set to the first day of the current month. `report_start_date` is calculated by taking `report_end_date` and subtracting 6 months. This effectively gives us a 6-month window *before* the current month.
2.  `date_boundaries.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them based on their `join_date` to include only those who signed up within our calculated `report_start_date` (inclusive) and `report_end_date` (exclusive).
3.  `relevant_customers.CALCULATE(...)`: For these filtered customers, we extract the `signup_year_val` (year of join date) and `signup_month_val` (month of join date). These will be used for grouping.
4.  `customers_with_signup_details.PARTITION(...)`: We partition the customers into monthly cohorts based on their `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (after PARTITION): For each monthly cohort:
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val` and `signup_month=signup_month_val`: These are the year and month identifiers for the cohort.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the Per Month Customer Signups by counting the number of `Customers` records within each partition (i.e., each signup month).
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: This calculates the Per Month Average Transaction Amount. It accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection for all customers within the current monthly cohort, then takes the `amount` from each transaction, and finally computes the average. If a cohort has customers with no transactions, `AVG` will typically return `None`.
6.  `monthly_metrics.ORDER_BY(...)`: The final result is ordered chronologically by `signup_year` and then `signup_month`.

This query will output a table where each row represents a month from the specified 6-month period, showing the year, month, the number of customers who signed up in that month (PMCS), and their average transaction amount (PMAT).",38.18300461769104,"# Step 1: Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month.

2.  For these filtered daily prices, we extract the `ticker_type` from the associated `ticker` and the `close` price. These will be named `dp_ticker_type` and `dp_close_price` respectively.
3.  We then `PARTITION` this intermediate collection by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups all the records from the last 7 days by their ticker type.
4.  Finally, for each group (i.e., for each `ticker_type`), we `CALCULATE` the `ticker_type` (which is our partition key) and the `ACP` (Average Closing Price) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `dp_close_price` values within that group.

Explanation:
The PyDough code first creates an intermediate collection `daily_prices_filtered`. This collection contains records from `DailyPrices` that fall within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). For each such record, it includes the `ticker_type` (aliased as `dp_ticker_type`) and the `close` price (aliased as `dp_close_price`).

Next, the `result` is obtained by partitioning `daily_prices_filtered` by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups the data by ticker type. For each `ticker_type` group, the `CALCULATE` function then outputs the `ticker_type` itself and the Average Closing Price (`ACP`), which is computed by averaging the `dp_close_price` values belonging to that specific ticker type group from the `daily_prices_filtered` collection.",31.590957164764404,"# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days and select relevant fields (ticker_type and close price)

1.  **Filter Customers**: Select only customers who joined in the year 2022.
2.  **Group by Country**: Partition the filtered customers by their `country`.
3.  **Calculate Counts for AR**: For each country group:
    *   **Numerator**: Count the number of customers who are `Active` (based on the `status` field) AND have at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This is the ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"".
    *   **Denominator**: Count the number of customers who have at least one transaction. This is the ""Total Number of Customers with Transactions"".
4.  **Calculate AR**: Apply the formula: `AR = (Numerator / Denominator) * 100`. If the denominator is zero (i.e., no customers in that country group had transactions), the AR will be 0.0 to avoid division by zero errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_from_2022 = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`:
    This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers whose `join_date` falls within the year 2022.

2.  `country_intermediate_stats = customers_from_2022.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the `customers_from_2022` and partitions them into groups based on their `country`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then operates on each country group.
    *   `output_country_name = country`:  Selects the country name for the group.
    *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(Customers.WHERE((status == ""Active"") & (HAS(transactions_made) == 1)))`:
        For each country group, this counts customers who satisfy two conditions: their `status` is ""Active"", AND they have at least one transaction (checked by `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This forms the numerator for the AR calculation.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`:
        For each country group, this counts all customers who have at least one transaction. This forms the denominator for the AR calculation.

3.  `result = country_intermediate_stats.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the intermediate statistics for each country.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Renames `output_country_name` to `country` for the final output.
    *   `AR = IFF(num_total_with_transactions > 0, (num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions, 0.0)`:
        This calculates the Activity Ratio (AR). It multiplies the ratio by `100.0` to express it as a percentage.
        The `IFF` function handles cases where `num_total_with_transactions` is zero (meaning no customers in that country group had transactions) by setting AR to `0.0`, thus preventing division by zero.

    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause is used to filter customers based on specific criteria.

2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with the letter 'j'.

3.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with the substring 'ez'.

4.  **`(STARTSWITH(...) | ENDSWITH(...))`**:
    *   The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions. A customer is selected if their name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez' (case-insensitively).

1.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select transactions that are of type ""sell"" and occurred within the last month. The date range will be from exactly one month ago to the current moment.
2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: The filtered transactions will be partitioned by their associated ticker symbol.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each ticker symbol group, we'll calculate:

4.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values, we'll apply the SPM formula:
    `(Total Amount from Sells - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`.
    We will also handle potential division by zero if `Total Amount from Sells` is 0, by setting SPM to 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_sell_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection. It keeps only transactions where `transaction_type` is ""sell"" AND the `date_time` is between one month ago (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`) and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`), inclusive.
2.  `grouped_by_ticker`:
    *   This takes `filtered_sell_transactions` and partitions them using `PARTITION(name=""ticker_sales_group"", by=(ticker.symbol))`. This groups transactions by the `symbol` of their associated `ticker`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group:
        *   `p_ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol`: Captures the ticker symbol (which is the partition key) for later use.
        *   `total_sell_amount_val=SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of `amount` for all transactions in the current ticker's group.
        *   `total_tax_val=SUM(Transactions.tax)`: Calculates the sum of `tax`.
        *   `total_commission_val=SUM(Transactions.commission)`: Calculates the sum of `commission`.
3.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the SPM:
    *   `ticker_symbol=p_ticker_symbol`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `spm=IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin.
        *   `IFF(total_sell_amount_val == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This checks if `total_sell_amount_val` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   Otherwise, SPM is calculated as `((total_sell_amount_val - (total_tax_val + total_commission_val)) / total_sell_amount_val) * 100.0`. The `100.0` ensures the result is a floating-point percentage.

2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Group the prepared daily data by ticker symbol, year, and month. For each group, calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price. This results in a collection where each row represents one month of data for a specific ticker.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC Calculation**: Take the monthly aggregated data and group it by ticker symbol. This creates series of monthly data for each ticker.
4.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: Within each ticker's monthly series, use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month. This requires ordering the data by year and month.
5.  **Calculate MoMC**: Compute the MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - previous_month_avg_close) / previous_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker) or zero to avoid errors.

Explanation:
The query is constructed in several stages:
1.  `daily_price_details`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices` and calculate necessary attributes for each record: the ticker symbol (`ticker_sym_field` from the related `ticker` object), the year (`price_year_field`), and month (`price_month_field`) of the price date, along with the closing, high, and low prices.
2.  `monthly_aggregates`: This step takes `daily_price_details` and partitions it by `ticker_sym_field`, `price_year_field`, and `price_month_field`. For each unique combination (i.e., for each ticker each month), it calculates the average closing price (`avg_c`), maximum high price (`max_h`), and minimum low price (`min_l`). The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a specific ticker.
3.  `result_with_prev_close`: This is a crucial step for calculating the Month-over-Month Change (MoMC).
    *   It takes `monthly_aggregates` and partitions it again, this time only by the ticker symbol (`ticker_s`). This groups all monthly records for each ticker together.
    *   The expression `.ticker_series_group.monthly_aggregates` accesses the series of monthly aggregate records belonging to the current ticker group.
    *   On this per-ticker monthly series, we use `CALCULATE` to pass through the existing monthly stats (`ticker_s_calc`, `year_m_calc`, `month_m_calc`, `avg_c_calc`, `max_h_calc`, `min_l_calc`).
    *   Crucially, it calculates `prev_avg_c_val` using the `PREV(avg_c, by=(year_m.ASC(), month_m.ASC()), per=""ticker_series_group"")` function. This function looks up the `avg_c` (average closing price) from the previous record within the same ticker's data, ordered by year and month. The `per=""ticker_series_group""` ensures that the `PREV` function resets for each new ticker.
4.  `final_ticker_monthly_performance`: The final `CALCULATE` step takes the output from `result_with_prev_close` and:
    *   Formats the month into ""YYYY-MM"" string using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD`.
    *   Selects the required fields: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, and `lowest_price`.
    *   Calculates `MoMC` using the current month's average closing price (`avg_c_calc`) and the previous month's average closing price (`prev_avg_c_val`). The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_avg_c_val` is `None` (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker) or zero, setting MoMC to `None` in such scenarios to prevent errors.

The final result, `final_ticker_monthly_performance`, will contain one row for each ticker for each month, including all the requested financial metrics. The data will be implicitly ordered by ticker symbol, then by year and month due to the partitioning and `PREV` function's ordering.",124.60953164100647,"# Step 1: Prepare daily data with necessary fields (ticker symbol, year, month, close, high, low)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The first `CALCULATE` creates new fields for each customer:
        *   `c_id`: Stores the customer's `_id`.
        *   `c_name`: Stores the customer's `name`.
        *   `signup_year`: Extracts the year from the customer's `join_date`.
        *   `signup_month`: Extracts the month from the customer's `join_date`.
    *   The second chained `CALCULATE` then computes:
        *   `num_signup_month_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same year and month as their `join_date`.
            *   It accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which lists all transactions for that customer).
            *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where `YEAR(date_time)` matches `signup_year` and `MONTH(date_time)` matches `signup_month`.
            *   `COUNT(...)` then counts these filtered transactions.

2.  **`highest_transaction_customer = customer_join_transactions.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This takes the `customer_join_transactions` collection (which now includes each customer and their count of transactions in their signup month).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_signup_month_transactions.DESC())` selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `num_signup_month_transactions`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` then formats the output to return only the requested fields:
        *   `_id`: The customer's ID (from the previously calculated `c_id`).
        *   `name`: The customer's name (from `c_name`).

result = top_3_transaction_types_by_customer_count
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Filtering**:
    *   First, a `date_condition` is defined to filter transactions. It selects transactions where the `date_time` is on or after January 1, 2023, and before April 1, 2023. Using `DATETIME(<date_string>, 'start of day')` ensures comparisons are made from the beginning of the respective days. This range inclusively covers all transactions from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(date_condition)` applies this filter to the `Transactions` collection, resulting in `filtered_transactions_by_date`.

2.  **Grouping and Aggregation**:
    *   `filtered_transactions_by_date.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))` groups the filtered transactions based on their `transaction_type`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`:  The transaction type itself.
        *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT` is used on `customer_id` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
        *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG` is used on `shares` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
    *   This step results in `transaction_type_summary`, a collection where each row represents a transaction type with its associated distinct customer count and average shares.

3.  **Selecting Top 3**:
    *   `transaction_type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` takes the `transaction_type_summary` and selects the top 3 records.
    *   The ranking is based on `num_distinct_customers` in descending order (`DESC()`), so transaction types with more distinct customers rank higher.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The final `result` variable holds a collection containing the `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares` for the top 3 transaction types as requested.",37.28563904762268,"# Define the date range condition for filtering transactions

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection, as each entry in this collection represents a unique customer.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction of type 'buy'. We can use the `HAS` function to check the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
    *   Inside `HAS`, we filter `transactions_made` for records where `transaction_type == 'buy'`.
3.  For the customers who meet this criterion, select their `_id` field, which is the customer's unique identifier.
4.  Rename the `_id` field to `customer_id` in the output as requested.

This approach ensures distinctness because we are iterating over the `Customers` collection, and each customer appears only once.

1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records to include only those where the `date` field is greater than or equal to '2023-04-01'.
3.  Group the filtered records by `ticker_id` to ensure distinctness. This can be achieved using the `PARTITION` function.
4.  Select the `ticker_id` from these distinct groups.

```python
distinct_ticker_ids_after_date = DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= ""2023-04-01"").PARTITION(name=""unique_tickers_by_id"", by=(ticker_id)).CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= ""2023-04-01"")`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection and then filters it. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those records where the `date` is on or after April 1, 2023. We assume the `date` field can be directly compared with the string ""2023-04-01"".
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""unique_tickers_by_id"", by=(ticker_id))`: After filtering, the `PARTITION` function is used to group the remaining `DailyPrices` records. It groups them by the `ticker_id` field. This effectively creates a group for each unique `ticker_id` present in the filtered data.
3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is applied to the result of the partitioning. For each unique group (representing a distinct `ticker_id`), it selects the `ticker_id` itself. The field `ticker_id` is directly used as it's the partitioning key.

    *   `== 1` is used because `HASNOT` returns a boolean-like value (0 or 1), and we are interested in cases where it's true (i.e., no historical prices).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id, symbol=symbol)`**: For the tickers that satisfy the `WHERE` condition (i.e., have no daily prices), this step selects and renames the `_id` field to `ticker_id` and selects the `symbol` field.",4.836139917373657,"tickers_without_daily_prices = Tickers.WHERE(HASNOT(historical_prices) == 1).CALCULATE(

2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_status=status, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`**:
    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` (i.e., for each unique transaction status):
        *   `transaction_status=status`: We select the `status` field and rename it to `transaction_status` for clarity in the output.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: We count the number of transactions within each `status` group. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to counting the records in the `Transactions` sub-collection within the current partition group.

Explanation:
1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We first process the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields: `cust_state` (derived from `transaction.customer.state`) and `tick_type` (derived from `transaction.ticker.ticker_type`).
2.  `state_ticker_combinations = transaction_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transaction_details` collection.

What is the monthly average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023?,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-01', sbTxDateTime) AS datetime, AVG(sbTxPrice) AS avg_price FROM sbTransaction WHERE sbTxStatus = 'success' AND sbTxDateTime BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31' GROUP BY datetime ORDER BY datetime;",Broker,"To determine the monthly average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with a `status` of ""successful"".
2.  From these successful transactions, calculate the `year` and `month` of the `date_time`. We also need to carry forward the `price` for aggregation.
3.  Further filter these transactions to include only those occurring in the 1st quarter of 2023 (Year 2023, and Months 1, 2, or 3).
4.  Partition the filtered transactions by year and month.
5.  For each month, calculate the average transaction `price`.
6.  The final result will show the year, month, and the calculated average transaction price, ordered by year and then month.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This selects only transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each successful transaction:
    *   `transaction_year = YEAR(date_time)`: Extracts the year from the `date_time` field.
    *   `transaction_month = MONTH(date_time)`: Extracts the month from the `date_time` field.
    *   `price = price`: Ensures the original `price` field is available for later aggregation.
3.  `.WHERE((transaction_year == 2023) & ISIN(transaction_month, (1, 2, 3)))`: This filters the records to include only those from January (1), February (2), or March (3) of the year 2023, effectively selecting the 1st quarter of 2023. The resulting collection is named `transactions_q1_2023_successful`.
4.  `transactions_q1_2023_successful.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered transactions by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`. Each group is named `monthly_group`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the original `Transactions` items that fall into the current partition.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by year in ascending order, and then by month in ascending order.

    *   `is_weekend_payment_calc = ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, resulting in a boolean value.
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the payments based on their `payment_week_start_date_calc` to include only those from the last 8 full calendar weeks, excluding the current week.
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc >= DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-56 days')`: Ensures the payment week is on or after the start of the week that began 56 days (8 weeks) before the start of the current week.
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc < DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Ensures the payment week is before the start of the current week, effectively excluding the current week.

1.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate the number of sales they made. This involves:
    *   Accessing their `sales_made` sub-collection.
    *   Filtering these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days. We use the `DATEDIFF` function for this: `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current moment.
        *   A `sale_date` of today results in a difference of 0 days.
        *   A `sale_date` from 29 days ago results in a difference of 29 days.

4.  The fields selected in the final `CALCULATE` are `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, `num_of_sales`, and `SR`.
5.  Finally, order the results by `SR` in ascending order, which effectively presents the salespersons from highest sales rank (best performance) to lowest.

```python
result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    # Pass through original fields and calculate sales metrics
    first_name=first_name,
    last_name=last_name,
    total_sales_amount=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.sale_price), 0.0),

```
**Explanation:**

*   `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: The first `CALCULATE` processes each salesperson.
    *   `first_name=first_name`, `last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's first and last names.
    *   `total_sales_amount=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.sale_price), 0.0)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of all sales in their `sales_made` sub-collection. If a salesperson has no sales, `SUM` might return NULL, so `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures their total sales amount is 0.0.
    *   `num_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the output of the first one.
    *   It passes through `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, and `num_of_sales`.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: Assigns a sales rank (`SR`) to each salesperson. The ranking is based on `total_sales_amount` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that salespersons with 0 sales (or if `DEFAULT_TO` was not used and `SUM` returned NULL) are ranked at the end. The `RANKING` function by default does not allow ties (`allow_ties=False`), meaning each salesperson gets a unique rank.
*   `.ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())`: Finally, the results are ordered by the calculated sales rank (`SR`) in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",48.33646559715271,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

3.  For each car associated with a sale, determine its latest inventory status. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the car's `inventory_snapshots`.
    *   Using the `RANKING` window function to find the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` for that specific car (`per=""car""`).
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to select this single latest snapshot.
    *   Checking the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot.
4.  Filter the sales records to include only those where the car's latest inventory status indicates it is no longer in inventory (i.e., `is_in_inventory == False`).
5.  Partition these filtered sales records by the car's `make` and `model`.
6.  For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` using `MAX(Sales.sale_price)`. This aggregates the original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records that fall into each partition group.

1.  Access the `Cars` collection.
2.  Filter these cars using a `WHERE` clause. The condition will check if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. We use `LIKE` with wildcards (`%`) for partial matching and `LOWER()` for case-insensitivity.
3.  For each car that matches the filter, use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select the `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `vin_number`.
    *   Calculate the `avg_sale_price` by applying the `AVG()` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field of the `sale_records` sub-collection associated with each car. If a car has no sale records, `AVG()` will typically result in a null value for `avg_sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""GMC Ford"", ""fordable""). `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains ""mustang"".
*   `|`: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'Ford' OR its model contains 'Mustang'.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These expressions select the respective car details directly.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries and Criteria**: We establish the start and end years for salesperson hiring (2022-2023). We also define the reporting period: the last 6 months, excluding the current month. Dates are truncated to the start of the month for aggregation.
2.  **Filter Salespersons**: We select salespersons hired within the specified years.
3.  **Identify Active Months**: We look at all sales made by any salesperson within the 6-month reporting window. From these sales, we extract all unique months (truncated to the start of the month) that had at least one sale. These unique months will form the rows of our report. This ensures that if the dealership had sales in a particular month within the window, that month will be listed.
4.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**: For each unique active month identified in step 3, we calculate:
    *   **PMSPS**: The total count of sales made by the *filtered salespersons* (from step 2) where the sale date falls into that specific month.
    *   **PMSR**: The total sum of `sale_price` from sales made by the *filtered salespersons* where the sale date falls into that specific month. If there are no sales for the filtered salespersons in a given active month, these metrics will correctly be 0.
5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in ascending order.

This approach ensures that any month within the last six (excluding the current) that had *any* sales activity at the dealership level will be included in the report. The PMSPS and PMSR for the specified group of salespersons will then be calculated for these months, appearing as 0 if they had no activity in a month that otherwise saw sales.

Explanation:

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we want a single aggregated result.
2.  `AVG(PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...).days_to_payment)`: This part calculates the average of the day differences.
    *   `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_to_payment=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`: For each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection, we calculate a new field `days_to_payment`.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)`: This function calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` (accessed via the `sale_record` relationship) and the `payment_date` of the payment.
    *   `.days_to_payment`: We then take this calculated `days_to_payment` for the `AVG` function.
3.  `ROUND(..., 2)`: The result of the `AVG` function is then rounded to 2 decimal places.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: `GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023**: We'll start by accessing the `Sales` collection and filtering for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **Calculate Total Revenue**: For these 2023 sales, the total revenue is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  **Calculate Total Cost**: For the cars sold in 2023, the total cost is the sum of the `cost` of each car. The cost of the car is accessed via the `car` relationship from a `Sale` record (i.e., `Sales.car.cost`).
4.  **Apply GPM Formula**: Using the calculated total revenue and total cost, we apply the GPM formula. This calculation is done at the `Dealership` level to produce a single GPM value for all relevant sales.
5.  **Structure**: We use a `CALCULATE` clause on the `Dealership` collection to compute `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023`. A subsequent `CALCULATE` clause is used to compute the `gpm_value` based on these intermediate results.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from all sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of all cars sold in 2023
    total_cost_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    # The result will be a single GPM value for the year 2023.
    gpm_value = (total_revenue_for_2023 - total_cost_for_2023) / total_cost_for_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following steps:

1.  It starts at the `Dealership` level, which is the top-level collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` clause computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023`: This is the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records in the `Sales` collection where the year of `sale_date` is 2023.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023`: This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales records in 2023. It accesses the car's cost via `Sales.car.cost`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause uses the `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023` values (calculated in the previous step) to compute the `gpm_value` according to the provided formula.
4.  The final result, `gpm_calculation`, will be a collection containing a single row with one column: `gpm_value`, representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",33.48591446876526,"gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection.
2.  For each sale, access its associated `car`.
3.  For that `car`, check its `inventory_snapshots`.
4.  We need to find sales where there is an inventory snapshot for the car indicating it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) and the `snapshot_date` of that inventory event is the same as the `sale_date` of the sale.
5.  From these filtered sales, identify the one with the maximum `sale_price`.
6.  Finally, retrieve the `make` and `model` of the car from this top sale, along with its `sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales.
    *   `HAS(collection) == 1` checks if the sub-collection (derived from `car.inventory_snapshots`) is not empty.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots` accesses the list of inventory snapshots for the car associated with each sale.
    *   The inner `WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))` filters these inventory snapshots to find entries where:
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: The car is marked as out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: The date of this inventory snapshot matches the `sale_date` of the current sale record. The `sale_date` here refers to the `sale_date` of the `Sales` record being evaluated.
    *   So, `sales_on_inventory_out_day` will contain all sales records for cars that went out of inventory on the same day they were sold.

2.  `top_priced_sale = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales from the previous step.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`k=1`) that has the highest `sale_price`. The `DESC()` ensures descending order, so the top one is the highest.

3.  `result = top_priced_sale.CALCULATE(car_make=car.make, car_model=car.model, highest_sale_price=sale_price)`:
    *   This line takes the single top-priced sale record.

The result should include all months present in the data, ordered chronologically.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Extract Year and Month**:
    First, we process the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, we extract the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions. These are stored as `pay_year` and `pay_month`.

2.  **Group by Month and Calculate Monthly Totals**:
    The `payments_info` collection (containing `pay_year`, `pay_month` for each payment) is then partitioned by `pay_year` and `pay_month`. This creates groups for each unique year-month combination present in the data.
    For each group, we calculate:
    *   `year_of_payment`: The year of the payment group.
    *   `month_of_payment`: The month of the payment group.
    *   `total_payments_this_month`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values from `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into the current year-month group. This gives the total payments for that specific month.

3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    On the `monthly_payment_summary` (which contains total payments for each month), we perform further calculations:
    *   `previous_month_total_payments`: We use the `PREV()` window function to get the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding month. The `by=(year_of_payment.ASC(), month_of_payment.ASC())` clause ensures that ""previous"" is determined chronologically. A `default=0.0` is provided for the `PREV` function; this means for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the `previous_month_total_payments` will be 0.0.
    *   `month_over_month_change`: This is calculated as `total_payments_this_month - previous_month_total_payments`, adhering to the specified definition.

4.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the results are ordered by `year_of_payment` and then `month_of_payment` in ascending order to present a chronological view of monthly payments and their MoM changes.

The query will include entries for all year-month combinations for which there is at least one payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` table. If a month has no payment records, it will not appear in the output.

3.  For the remaining salespersons, calculate their ASP. ASP is defined as `total sales amount / number of sales`.
    *   `total sales amount` is `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. `HAS(sales_made) == 1` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (list of sales for that salesperson) is not empty. This is crucial to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(calc_first_name=first_name, calc_last_name=last_name, calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))`: For each salesperson who has made sales:
    *   `calc_first_name=first_name` and `calc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's first and last names, storing them in temporary variables `calc_first_name` and `calc_last_name`.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP).
        *   `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` sums the `sale_price` of all sales made by the salesperson.
        *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
        *   The result is stored in the `calculated_asp` field.

The goal is to return a distinct list of salesperson IDs who have processed at least one sale that was paid for in cash.
To achieve this, we will:
1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, check their `sales_made`.
3.  For each sale made, check its `payment` (list of `PaymentsReceived`).
4.  Filter these payments to find any where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
5.  If a salesperson has at least one such sale with a cash payment, we include their `_id` (as `salesperson_id`) in the result.
6.  Selecting `_id` from the filtered `Salespersons` collection inherently provides a distinct list.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`: This is the core filtering logic.
    *   `sales_made`: This accesses the list of sales associated with each salesperson.

    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`: This filters the payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one record resulting from the nested path (`sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`). If a salesperson has at least one sale paid in cash, this condition will be true.
3.  `.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = _id)`: For each salesperson that satisfies the `WHERE` condition, this selects their `_id` and renames it to `salesperson_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made) == 1)`**: This filters the `Salespersons` collection.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",44.77393436431885,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` and `end_period_date = DATETIME('now')`: These lines define the time window for our analysis. `start_period_date` is set to exactly three months before the current date/time, and `end_period_date` is the current date/time.
2.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  `sales_in_defined_period = sales_made.WHERE((sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date <= end_period_date))`: In the first `CALCULATE`, for each salesperson, we create a temporary sub-collection `sales_in_defined_period`. This sub-collection contains only the sales from `sales_made` where the `sale_date` falls within our defined 3-month window.
4.  The second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `first_name = first_name, last_name = last_name`: We select the salesperson's first and last names.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_defined_period.sale_price)`: We calculate the `total_revenue` for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of all sales in their `sales_in_defined_period` sub-collection. This aligns with the provided definition of revenue.
    *   `total_sales = COUNT(sales_in_defined_period)`: We count the number of sales in `sales_in_defined_period` to get the `total_sales` for each salesperson.
5.  `.WHERE(total_sales > 0)`: This filters out salespersons who had no sales during the specified 3-month period. This ensures that `TOP_K` operates on relevant data and avoids potential issues with zero or null revenues if those salespersons were not filtered.
6.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, we select the top 3 salespersons based on their `total_revenue`, with the highest revenue ranked first.

    *   `_current_week_start_date`: The start of the current ISO week.

2.  **Filter Payments**: We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated previous ISO week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: From the filtered payments, we extract the day part of the `payment_date` (to aggregate daily) and carry forward the `payment_method` and `payment_amount`.

4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: We then partition these prepared records by the extracted `payment_day` and `payment_method`. For each group, we sum the `payment_amount` to get the total daily amount for that specific payment method.

5.  **Format Output**: The final result will show the transaction date (day), the payment method type, and the total received amount for that combination.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_context`: This calculates two key dates using the main `Dealership` collection as a starting point:
    *   `_current_week_start_date`: Determined by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`) and truncating it to the 'start of week'. We assume this means Monday 00:00:00 of the current week as per ISO 8601.
    *   `_previous_week_start_date`: Calculated by subtracting 7 days from `_current_week_start_date`, giving Monday 00:00:00 of the previous week.

2.  `payments_in_scope`:
    *   This starts by accessing the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection from the `date_context` (which makes `_previous_week_start_date` and `_current_week_start_date` available).
    *   It filters these payments using `WHERE` to include only those where `payment_date` is on or after `_previous_week_start_date` and before `_current_week_start_date`. This range covers the entire previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday).
    *   `CALCULATE` then prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_for_grouping`: Extracts the date part (day with time truncated to 00:00:00) from `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This allows for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method`: The original `payment_method` is carried over for grouping.
        *   `payment_amount`: The original `payment_amount` is carried over for summation.

3.  `result`:
    *   This takes `payments_in_scope` and partitions it using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""daily_payment_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partitioned groups (not strictly used later in this query but good practice).
    *   `by=(payment_day_for_grouping, payment_method)`: Groups the records by the unique combinations of the extracted day and payment method.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` transforms each group into a single output row:
        *   `transaction_date`: The day of the transactions, taken from `payment_day_for_grouping`.
        *   `payment_method_type`: The payment method for this group, taken from `payment_method`.
        *   `total_received_amount`: The sum of `payment_amount` for all records within that specific day and payment method group, calculated using `SUM(payments_in_scope.payment_amount)`.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  For each sale, extract the customer's state, the month, and the year of the sale.
3.  Calculate the first month of the quarter (1 for Q1, 4 for Q2, 7 for Q3, 10 for Q4) based on the sale month.
4.  Construct a string representation for the first date of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This will serve as a partitioning key.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_base_data`: Filters sales to include only those from the year 2023. It then calculates `customer_state_attr` (customer's state), `sale_month_attr` (month of sale), and `sale_year_attr` (year of sale).
2.  `sales_with_quarter_month`: Takes the previous result and calculates `q_start_month_attr`, which is the first month number of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, etc.).
3.  `sales_for_partition`: Constructs `quarter_date_key`, a string representing the first day of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This uses `JOIN_STRINGS` to combine the year, the formatted quarter start month (using `LPAD` to ensure two digits), and ""01"" for the day.
4.  `quarterly_sales_by_state`: This is the final step.
    *   It partitions the `sales_for_partition` data using `customer_state_attr` and `quarter_date_key` as grouping keys.
    *   Within each group (a unique combination of state and quarter), it calculates:
        *   `state`: The customer's state.
        *   `quarter_representation`: The string representing the first date of the quarter.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales falling into that specific state and quarter. `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates values from the original `Sales` collection context corresponding to the records in each partition group.
5.  `result`: The variable `result` holds the final dataset with total quarterly sales grouped by customer state.",84.57148241996765,"# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and extract necessary attributes like customer state, sale month, and sale year.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the average Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each drug based on the provided definition.

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection and aims to calculate new fields for each drug.
    *   `drug_name_output=drug_name`: It selects the `drug_name` and assigns it to `drug_name_output`.
    *   `avg_ddd_value=AVG(...)`: It calculates the average DDD for the drug and assigns it to `avg_ddd_value`.

2.  **`AVG(treatments_used_in. ... .individual_treatment_ddd)`**: This part computes the average of DDD values derived from the treatments associated with each drug.
    *   `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.
    *   `.WHERE((HASNOT(end_dt) == 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
        *   `HASNOT(end_dt) == 0`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total duration of the treatment in days is positive. This is crucial to avoid division by zero or undefined DDDs for zero-duration treatments. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of full days between the start and end dates.
    *   `.CALCULATE(individual_treatment_ddd=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD.
        *   `tot_drug_amt`: This is the total drug amount consumed during that specific treatment.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the total days of that specific treatment.
        *   The result of the division is the DDD for that single treatment, assigned to `individual_treatment_ddd`.
    *   `.individual_treatment_ddd`: This extracts the calculated `individual_treatment_ddd` values from the inner `CALCULATE` operation, forming a collection of DDDs for all relevant treatments of the current drug.
    *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `individual_treatment_ddd` values, yielding the `avg_ddd_value` for the drug.

If a drug has no treatments that meet the specified criteria (e.g., all its treatments have a null `end_dt` or a non-positive duration), the `avg_ddd_value` for that drug will be null. The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name_output` and its corresponding `avg_ddd_value`.",41.693597078323364,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date References Calculation (`date_references`):**
    *   The query first calculates the year and month for three specific time periods: the last full month (M-1), the month before last (M-2), and two months before last (M-3). This is done relative to the current date using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` as a base and subtracting 1, 2, or 3 months.
    *   These date components (`m1_year_val`, `m1_month_val`, etc.) are calculated at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level, making them available as context for subsequent operations on the `Treatments` collection.

2.  **Filtering and Augmenting Treatments (`treatments_in_target_months`):**
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection via `date_references.Treatments`.
    *   For each treatment, it extracts the `treatment_yr` (year of `start_dt`) and `treatment_mth` (month of `start_dt`).
    *   It stores the `patient_id` as `patient_identifier` for later distinct counting.
    *   It adds a boolean flag `is_biologic_drug_treatment` which is true if the treatment's associated drug has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these augmented treatments, keeping only those whose `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth` match one of the three target months calculated in `date_references`.

3.  **Partitioning and Aggregation (`monthly_patient_summary`):**
    *   The `treatments_in_target_months` collection is then partitioned by `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth`. This groups all treatments by the month they occurred in.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each of the target months that has treatment data):
        *   `month_label`: A display string for the month is created in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-10"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `start_period_inclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This calculates the date that is exactly 6 months before the first day of the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` would be July 1st, 2024. Subtracting 6 months gives January 1st, 2024. Treatments on or after this date are included.
    *   `end_period_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This calculates the first day of the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, this would be July 1st, 2024. Treatments before this date are included (i.e., up to June 30th, 2024).

2.  **Filter Patients**:
    *   `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This selects all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".

3.  **Access and Filter Treatments**:
    *   `.treatments_received`: For the selected patient(s), this accesses their list of treatments.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_period_inclusive) & (start_dt < end_period_exclusive))`: This filters the treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` (start date of the treatment) falls within the defined six-month period, excluding the current month.

    *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the number of treatments that satisfy all the above conditions.
    *   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(num_alice_treatments_last_6m_exclusive = ...)`: The final count is assigned to the field `num_alice_treatments_last_6m_exclusive` within the main `DermTreatment` context, resulting in a single aggregated value.

1.  First, for each doctor, we calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by navigating from the `Doctors` collection to their `prescribed_treatments`, then to the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique `drug_id`s. We also select the doctor's ID and specialty, using intermediate names for clarity and potential renaming.
2.  Next, we partition this collection of doctors (now with their distinct drug counts) by their specialty. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  Finally, for the doctors within each specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed (in descending order, so more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures this ranking is done independently for each specialty. We also format the output fields to match the requested names (`doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs`, `SDRSDR`).

)
```

**Explanation:**

The query is designed to provide a ranked list of doctors based on the diversity of drugs they prescribe, with the ranking performed within each medical specialty.

1.  **`doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `doc_id_val=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID and assigns it to `doc_id_val`.
    *   `speciality_val=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty and assigns it to `speciality_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs_val=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: This calculates the number of unique drugs prescribed by each doctor. It navigates through `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments for the doctor), then to the `drug` for each treatment, and finally to the `drug_id` of that drug. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `drug_id`s. If a doctor has prescribed no drugs, this count will be 0.

2.  **`specialty_partition = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection (where each doctor now has their distinct drug count).
    *   `name=""specialty_group_partition""`: Names the resulting partition structure.
    *   `by=(speciality_val)`: Groups the doctors based on their `speciality_val`. All doctors with the same specialty will be in the same group within this partition.

3.  **`result = specialty_partition.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `specialty_partition.Doctors`: This accesses the individual doctor records within each group of the partition created in the previous step.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id=doc_id_val`: Assigns the doctor's ID to the output field `doc_id`.
        *   `specialty=speciality_val`: Assigns the doctor's specialty to the output field `specialty`. Note the change in spelling from the database field `speciality` to the requested `specialty`.
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs_val`: Assigns the count of distinct drugs to `number_of_distinct_drugs`.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC(), per=""specialty_group_partition"", allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (doctors prescribing more unique drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., Rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_group_partition""`: Crucially, this ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group. A doctor's rank is relative to other doctors in the same specialty.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors within the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each item represents a doctor and includes their `doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs` they prescribed, and their `SDRSDR` rank within that specialty.",77.06411743164062,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   The query first establishes the time window: the last 12 full months, excluding the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_date` is calculated as the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `period_start_date` is calculated by subtracting 12 months from `current_month_start_date`, effectively giving the start of the 12-month observation window.
    *   These dates are calculated once at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level for efficiency.

2.  **Filtering Treatments**:
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Treatments are filtered using `WHERE` to include only those whose `start_dt` falls on or after `period_start_date` and before `current_month_start_date`. This ensures we get exactly 12 months of data, excluding the current month.

3.  **Preparing for Aggregation**:
    *   For the filtered treatments, `CALCULATE` is used to extract `treatment_start_year = YEAR(start_dt)` and `treatment_start_month = MONTH(start_dt)`. These will serve as keys for monthly aggregation. The instruction ""Truncate start_dt to month for aggregation"" is achieved by grouping by these year and month components.

4.  **Monthly Aggregation (Partitioning)**:
    *   The `PARTITION` function groups the `treatments_in_period` by `treatment_start_year` and `treatment_start_month`.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `month_display_label`: A string representation of the month (e.g., ""2023-01"") for easy readability, using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `PMPD` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received treatments (and thus had associated diagnoses) within that specific month.
        *   `PMTC` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated as `COUNT(Treatments.treatment_id)`. This counts the total number of treatments administered in that month.

5.  **Ordering**:
    *   The results are ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC())`.

6.  **Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to match the requested output: `month` (the YYYY-MM label), `PMPD`, and `PMTC`.

This query will return a row for each of the last 12 months (if there was activity), showing the month, the count of unique patients diagnosed (PMPD), and the total count of treatments (PMTC).",60.67799234390259,"# Define date boundaries for the last 12 months, excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin')`**: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Drugs` collection and filters it to find the drug record where the `drug_name` is 'Drugalin'.

2.  **`.treatments_used_in`**: From the filtered drug (Drugalin), this accesses the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which lists all treatments where Drugalin was used.

3.  **`.patient`**: For each treatment in the `treatments_used_in` list, this navigates to the linked `patient` record. This results in a collection of all patients who have received Drugalin.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(average_patient_weight_kg=AVG(weight_kg))`**: Finally, this applies a `CALCULATE` operation on the collection of patients who received Drugalin.
    *   `AVG(weight_kg)`: This aggregation function calculates the average of the `weight_kg` field for all patients in the collection.
    *   `average_patient_weight_kg=...`: The calculated average weight is assigned to a new field named `average_patient_weight_kg`.

The query will return a collection containing a single row and a single column (`average_patient_weight_kg`), which holds the average weight of patients treated with 'Drugalin'.

1.  Identify the relevant `Outcomes` records: We are interested in records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the condition `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` to check for non-null numeric values, as comparisons with `NULL` typically yield `NULL`, and `NULL` in a `WHERE` condition filters out the row.
2.  Calculate Averages: From these filtered outcomes, we need to compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` globally.
3.  Apply the Formula: Use the given formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
4.  Handle Division by Zero: If the average `day7_pasi_score` is zero, the formula would lead to division by zero. In this case, the result should be `null`.

This will be done using a two-stage `CALCULATE`:
-   The first `CALCULATE` computes `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100` from the filtered `Outcomes`.
-   The second `CALCULATE` uses these averages to compute the final `d7d100pir_percentage`.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block is performed on the top-level `DermTreatment` collection.
    *   It computes two aggregate values:
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d7`: This is the average of `day7_pasi_score` from `Outcomes` records. The `Outcomes` are filtered to include only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` works because if `field` is `NULL`, comparisons like `NULL > 0` result in `NULL`, and `NULL | NULL` is `NULL`, causing the `WHERE` clause to filter out such rows.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: Similarly, this is the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the same set of filtered `Outcomes`.
    *   The result of this stage (`calculation_stage`) is a collection with a single row containing `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100`.

2.  The second `CALCULATE` block operates on `calculation_stage`.
    *   It calculates `d7d100pir_percentage` using the averages computed in the previous stage.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `avg_pasi_score_d7` might be zero. If it is zero, `KEEP_IF(0.0, 1==0)` (which evaluates to `null`) is returned to prevent division by zero errors. Otherwise, the D7D100PIR formula `(avg_pasi_score_d100 - avg_pasi_score_d7) / avg_pasi_score_d7 * 100.0` is applied. The `100.0` ensures floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.

The final `result` will be a collection with one row and one column, `d7d100pir_percentage`, containing the overall D7D100PIR value. A negative percentage indicates an improvement (reduction) in PASI score from day 7 to day 100.",85.01945424079895,"# Stage 1: Calculate average PASI scores for day 7 and day 100 from valid outcomes

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want to calculate a single aggregated value (the count of specific patients).
2.  **`pic_female_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `pic_female_patients` which will hold the result of our count.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Female"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`**:
    *   We access the `Patients` collection.
    *   We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these patients based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `gender == ""Female""`: Selects only patients whose `gender` is ""Female"".
        *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Selects only patients whose `ins_type` is ""Private"", based on the definition of PIC (private insured patient count).
4.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function then counts the number of patients who satisfy both conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to calculate the total number of relevant adverse events.
3.  To do this, we iterate through each `treatment` associated with the drug (`treatments_used_in`).
4.  For each `treatment`, we then iterate through its associated `adverse_events`.
5.  For each `adverse_event`, we check if its `reported_dt` falls within the same month and year as the `start_dt` of its parent `treatment`.
    *   We create a calculated field `is_relevant_ae` for each adverse event, which is 1 if the condition (same month and year) is met, and 0 otherwise. The condition is `(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`. Here, `treatment.start_dt` refers to the start date of the parent treatment of the current adverse event.
6.  We then `SUM` these `is_relevant_ae` values across all adverse events for all treatments associated with a drug. This gives the `count_of_adverse_events` for that drug.
7.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(1, by=count_of_adverse_events.DESC())` to select the drug with the highest count.

This PyDough code snippet performs the following actions:
1.  It iterates over each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, it calculates three fields:
    *   `drug_identifier`: The ID of the drug.
    *   `name_of_drug`: The name of the drug.
    *   `count_of_adverse_events`: This is the sum of adverse events that meet a specific criterion.
        *   It navigates from the drug to its `treatments_used_in`, and then to each treatment's `adverse_events`.
        *   For every adverse event, it calculates `is_relevant_ae`. This field is set to 1 if the adverse event's `reported_dt` occurs in the same calendar month and year as its parent `treatment`'s `start_dt`. Otherwise, it's 0.
        *   The `SUM(...)` function then adds up all these `is_relevant_ae` values (effectively counting the relevant adverse events) for the current drug.

2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `prescribed_treatments` is a sub-collection within `Doctors` representing all treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` checks if this sub-collection is not empty (i.e., the doctor has prescribed at least one treatment).
    *   `== 1` completes the condition, ensuring we only keep doctors who have prescribed one or more treatments.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_id=doc_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**: This selects the specified fields for the doctors who met the filter criteria.

1.  **`Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1)`**:

    *   `HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1` checks if the `treatments_received` sub-collection for each patient is empty. `treatments_received` is a list of treatments associated with a patient.

The result should include the diagnosis name, the count of distinct patients, and this maximum itch score.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Calculate Metrics per Diagnosis**:
    *   Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
    *   For each diagnosis, calculate:
        *   `diag_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis.
        *   `max_itch_score_val`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score found in the `outcome_records` linked to the diagnosis through `treatments_for`. The `MAX` aggregation function will be used here.
        *   `num_patients_val`: The number of distinct patients (`patient_id`) who received treatments for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT` on `treatments_for.patient.patient_id`.

2.  **Determine Top 3 Diagnoses**:
    *   Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 3 diagnoses.
    *   The primary sorting criterion for ""top"" will be `max_itch_score_val` in descending order. The phrase ""by maximum itch VAS score ... and number of distinct patients"" is interpreted as primarily sorting by the itch score, with the number of patients being an attribute to display.
    *   `na_pos='last'` is used with `DESC` to ensure that diagnoses with no (null) itch scores are ranked at the bottom.

3.  **Format Output**:
    *   Use a final `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `six_months_ago_from_today = DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
2.  `today_date = DATETIME('now')`: This line defines a variable holding the current date and time.
3.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters:
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition filters treatments where the associated diagnosis's name (`diagnosis.diag_name`) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `LIKE` with `%` wildcards allows 'psoriasis' to appear anywhere in the name.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the drug used in the treatment (`drug`) has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function checks for the existence or non-nullity of this date.
    *   `(end_dt >= six_months_ago_from_today) & (end_dt <= today_date)`: This compound condition filters treatments that have an `end_dt` (end date) that is on or after 6 months ago from today, and on or before today. This effectively selects treatments that ended within the last 6-month period.
4.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(count_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`: Finally, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a calculation. `COUNT(filtered_treatments)` counts the number of treatment records that met all the conditions in the `WHERE` clause. The result is assigned to a new field named `count_of_qualifying_treatments`.",27.04844045639038,"# Define date boundaries for the ""last 6 months""

1.  **Determine the Target Registration Year**: We calculate the year corresponding to ""2 years ago"" by subtracting 2 from the current year, obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`.
2.  **Filter Doctors**: We select doctors from the `Doctors` collection whose `year_reg` matches this target year. We also ensure these doctors have at least one prescribed treatment using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`.
3.  **Identify the First Treatment**: For each selected doctor, we need to find their earliest prescribed treatment.
    *   We access the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection.
    *   We use the `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)` function to rank treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `per=""Doctors""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each doctor. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single treatment is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date (though the specific tie-breaking rule is implicit).
    *   We filter for the treatment where this rank is 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR()` is then used to convert the resulting single-item collection into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields.
4.  **Select and Rename Fields**: We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`, and from their first treatment, the `start_dt` (as `first_treatment_date`) and `treatment_id` (as `first_treatment_id_val`). We interpret ""treatment _id"" as the `treatment_id` field from the `Treatments` collection, as it's the primary identifier for treatments.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Establish Context**: We'll start from the `Ewallet` collection to calculate `current_week_start_val`, which is the start date of the current week. This will be used as a reference for identifying the target weeks.
2.  **Filter Users**: Navigate to `Users` and filter for users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""CA"".
3.  **Process Notifications**: For the `notifications` of these filtered users:
    *   Calculate `notification_actual_week_start`: Truncate the `created_at` timestamp of each notification to the start of its week. This will be used for grouping.
    *   Calculate `is_notification_weekend`: A boolean flag set to true if the notification's `created_at` day is a Saturday or Sunday.
    *   Calculate `num_weeks_before_current`: Determine how many full weeks the `notification_actual_week_start` is before the `current_week_start_val`.
4.  **Filter by Week**: Keep only those notifications where `num_weeks_before_current` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
5.  **Partition by Week**: Group these filtered notifications using `PARTITION` by the `notification_actual_week_start`.
6.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each weekly group:
    *   Output `week_start_date_output` (the week's start date).
    *   Calculate `total_notifications_count` by counting all notifications in the group.
    *   Calculate `weekend_notifications_count` by summing the `is_notification_weekend` flag (True becomes 1, False becomes 0 in SUM).
7.  **Order Results**: Sort the weekly summaries by `week_start_date_output` in descending order to show the most recent of the three weeks first.

This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  It initializes a context by calculating `current_week_start_val` (the start date of the current week) at the `Ewallet` (top) level.
2.  It filters users to include only those from the ""US"" or ""CA"".
3.  For each notification associated with these users, it calculates:
    *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the notification was created.
    *   `is_notification_weekend`: A boolean flag that is true if the notification was created on a Saturday or Sunday.
    *   `num_weeks_before_current`: The difference in weeks between the notification's week start and the `current_week_start_val`.
4.  It filters these processed notifications to retain only those where `num_weeks_before_current` is 1, 2, or 3, effectively selecting notifications from the three full weeks prior to the current week.
5.  The `relevant_notifications` are then partitioned by `notification_actual_week_start`, grouping them by the week they were sent.
6.  For each weekly group, it calculates:
    *   `week_start_date_output`: The start date of that specific week.

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and then apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.

    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `category` is ""retail"". `LOWER()` is used to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition filters for merchants who have at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS()` function checks for the existence of records in the `coupons` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use the `CALCULATE` function to define the output fields.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions_by_us_users_last_7_days = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by creating a contextless expression `filtered_transactions_by_us_users_last_7_days` that represents the set of transactions we are interested in.
    *   We access the `Transactions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause applies two conditions:
        *   `sending_user.country == ""US""`: This filters transactions where the `country` attribute of the `sending_user` (accessed via the relationship from `Transactions` to `Users`) is ""US"". This ensures the transaction was made by a user from the US.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters transactions based on their `created_at` timestamp.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's creation date and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` ensures that we include transactions from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago (effectively covering the last 7 days inclusive of today).

2.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Ewallet` collection to perform a global calculation.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to derive new fields:
        *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions_by_us_users_last_7_days)`: This counts the number of transactions in the `filtered_transactions_by_us_users_last_7_days` set.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions_by_us_users_last_7_days.amount)`: This sums the `amount` field for all transactions in the `filtered_transactions_by_us_users_last_7_days` set.

1.  **Filter `UserBalances`**: Select all `UserBalances` records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today and 7 days prior. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now'))` which calculates the number of full days between `updated_at` and the current moment. A result of 0 means `updated_at` is today, and 7 means `updated_at` was exactly 7 days ago. So, we filter for values between 0 and 7.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: For each unique `user_id` found in the filtered balances, calculate their average `balance` from these records. This gives the AMB for each user over the specified one-week period, as per the definition ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". This is achieved by partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id` and then calculating the average of `balance` for each user group.

2.  `user_uid=uid, user_username=username`: We select the `uid` and `username` as identifiers for each user, renaming them to `user_uid` and `user_username` respectively.
3.  `latest_user_balance=...`: This defines the LUB.
    *   `balances`: This refers to the sub-collection of `UserBalances` associated with the current user.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:

This involves summing the amounts from successfully received transactions where the receiver type indicates a merchant, and then ranking merchants based on these total amounts.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Start with the `Merchants` collection**: This is because we need to output information and rankings for each merchant.
2.  **Calculate Revenue for Each Merchant**:
    *   For each merchant, we access their `transactions_received`. These are transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only ""successful"" ones. The problem implies ""successfully received transactions"", so we'll filter by `status == ""completed""` (a common status for successful transactions).
    *   Additionally, we filter by `receiver_type == 1` as specified in the problem description for transactions pertaining to merchants.
    *   The `amount` of these filtered transactions is summed up to get `calculated_revenue` for each merchant. If a merchant has no such transactions, this sum might be NULL or 0. We assume `SUM` over an empty set results in NULL.
    *   We also select the merchant's `name` and `category` for the final output, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` temporarily to avoid potential naming conflicts.
3.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Fields**:
    *   The previously calculated `m_name`, `m_category`, and `calculated_revenue` are carried forward.
    *   The `RANKING` function is used to determine `revenue_rank`.
        *   It ranks merchants based on `calculated_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the highest revenue gets rank 1.
        *   `na_pos='last'` is used within `DESC()` to ensure that merchants with NULL revenue (i.e., no qualifying transactions) are ranked last, contributing to deterministic output.
        *   `allow_ties=True` ensures that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects the required fields with the specified names: `merchant_name`, `category`, `revenue_amount`, and `revenue_rank`.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average of Daily Active Users (DAU) for each month in the specified period.
- A **Daily Active User (DAU)** for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from transactions where `sender_type == 0` on that particular day.
- The **PMDAU** for a month is the average of these DAU counts over all days in that month.
- The results are aggregated and presented per month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"").

The calculation involves the following steps:
1.  **Determine Date Range**: Identify the start of the month two months ago and the start of the current month. The transactions considered will be within this range (e.g., if the current month is May, transactions from March 1st up to, but not including, May 1st will be included, covering all of March and April).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that have `sender_type == 0` and fall within the calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Aggregation**: For each relevant transaction, extract:
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-03"") for final monthly grouping.
    *   `day_date`: The date of the transaction, truncated to the start of the day (e.g., ""2023-03-15 00:00:00""), for daily grouping.
    *   `sender_id`: The ID of the sender.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transactions by `year_month_str` and `day_date`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each day), count the number of distinct `sender_id`s. This gives the `dau_count` for that day.
5.  **Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   Group the daily `dau_count`s by `year_month_str`.
    *   For each month, calculate the average of the `dau_count`s. This average is the PMDAU for that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable stores the result of filtering `UserSessions`. It includes only those sessions that started between June 1, 2023 (inclusive) and June 8, 2023 (exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_session_duration` which is the duration of that single session in seconds. The `user_id` is also explicitly selected to be used as a key in the next step.
2.  `user_aggregated_data`: This step takes `sessions_with_duration` and partitions it by `user_id`.
    *   `name=""user_partition_group""` gives a name to the groups within the partition.
    *   `by=(user_id)` specifies that sessions should be grouped based on their `user_id`.
    *   In the subsequent `CALCULATE` clause:
        *   `user_id_key=user_id` selects the partitioning key (the user's ID).
        *   `summed_duration_seconds=SUM(user_partition_group.calculated_session_duration)` calculates the total session time for each user by summing up the `calculated_session_duration` of all sessions belonging to that user within the partition group.
3.  `sorted_user_durations`: The data is then sorted by `summed_duration_seconds` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.
4.  `result`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested by the prompt. The `total_duration` will be an integer value representing seconds.",78.04167890548706,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by date and calculate duration for each session.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`**: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Merchants` collection and filters it to select only the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is equal to `1`.
2.  **`.coupons`**: From the selected merchant (with `mid == 1`), this accesses its `coupons` sub-collection. This gives us a list of all coupons offered by this specific merchant.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is then applied to each coupon in the list obtained from the previous step.
    *   **`coupon_id=cid`**: It selects the `cid` (coupon ID) for each coupon and renames it to `coupon_id` in the output.
    *   **`total_transacted_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`**: For each coupon, it accesses the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which lists all transactions where this coupon was used). It then calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these transactions, effectively giving the total amount transacted using that specific coupon. The result is named `total_transacted_amount`.

The final result, `coupon_transaction_totals_for_merchant_1`, will be a collection where each record contains the `coupon_id` and the `total_transacted_amount` for that coupon, specifically for coupons offered by merchant with ID 1.",14.714916467666626,"coupon_transaction_totals_for_merchant_1 = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons.CALCULATE(

1.  Define the time window: from exactly one month ago relative to the current moment, up to the current moment.
2.  Access the `UserSessions` collection.
3.  Filter the sessions where `session_start_ts` falls within this time window.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we are calculating an aggregate value (total count) across a subset of `UserSessions`.
2.  `tuc_count = COUNT(...)`: This defines a new field `tuc_count` which will hold the total number of user sessions.
3.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `UserSessions` collection and apply a filter.
4.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This function call generates a timestamp representing exactly one month prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function call generates the current timestamp.
    *   The condition filters sessions whose `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to one month ago and less than or equal to the current moment, effectively covering the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"".
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `UserSessions` records that satisfy the `WHERE` clause condition.

What was the STR for wallet transactions in the previous month?STR (success transaction rate) = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions,"SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) AS STR FROM wallet_transactions_daily WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', created_at) = strftime('%Y-%m', 'now', 'start of month', '-1 month');",Ewallet,"To calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR) for wallet transactions in the previous month, we need to follow the definition: STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions.

Here's how we'll construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll identify transactions that occurred from the start of the last month up to, but not including, the start of the current month. We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')` for the start and `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` for the end of this period. The `created_at` field of the `Transactions` collection will be used for this filtering.
2.  **Identify ""Wallet Transactions""**: We assume all transactions within the `Transactions` collection are considered ""wallet transactions"" for this query, as no specific `transaction_type` for ""wallet"" was provided.
3.  **Identify ""Successful Transactions""**: We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` field is equal to `""COMPLETED""`.
4.  **Calculate Counts**:
    *   Filter the `Transactions` collection to get only those from the previous month.
    *   Count the total number of these filtered transactions.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (where `status == ""COMPLETED""`) among these.
5.  **Calculate STR**: Divide the count of successful transactions by the total count of transactions. We'll ensure floating-point division and handle cases where the total number of transactions is zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).
6.  **Output**: The query will produce a single value representing the STR for the previous month. This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` graph level to ensure an aggregated result.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_in_prev_month`: This expression filters the `Transactions` collection. It selects transactions where the `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous calendar month. The start of the previous month is determined by `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`, and the end is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
2.  `str_intermediate_calculation`: This starts a calculation at the `Ewallet` (top-level graph) scope.
    *   `count_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `transactions_in_prev_month` that have a `status` of `""COMPLETED""`.
    *   `count_total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions from `transactions_in_prev_month`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` computes `calculated_str_value`:
        *   It uses `IFF` to check if `count_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
        *   If there are transactions, it calculates STR by dividing `count_successful_tx_prev_month` by `count_total_tx_prev_month`. Multiplication by `1.0` ensures the result is a float.
        *   If there are no transactions, STR is set to `0.0`.
3.  `previous_month_success_transaction_rate`: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the `calculated_str_value` and renames it to `previous_month_str`, providing the final STR value as requested.",54.69628691673279,"# Filter transactions for the previous month.

    *   `_merchant_creation_year = YEAR(created_at)` and `_merchant_creation_month = MONTH(created_at)`: These lines extract the year and month of the merchant's creation date. The underscore prefix is used to distinguish these calculated values.
    *   `num_matching_coupons = COUNT(coupons.WHERE(...))`: This calculates the number of coupons for the current merchant that satisfy the condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
    *   `LOWER(country) == 'us'`: This condition filters users whose country is 'US', performing a case-insensitive comparison by converting the `country` field to lowercase.
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition ensures that the user has at least one notification that satisfies both sub-conditions:
        *   `notification_type == 'promotional'`: The notification's type must be exactly 'promotional'.
        *   `status == 'unread'`: The notification's status must be exactly 'unread'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two main conditions, so a user must be from the US AND have at least one relevant unread promotional notification.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the users who pass the `WHERE` clause, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   `username=username`: Selects the `username` of the user.

**Explanation:**

1.  `relevant_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table.
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Selects transactions only from the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Ensures that the sender is a user, not a merchant.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successful transactions.
    *   `(HAS(sending_user) == 1) & (sending_user.status == ""active"")`: Ensures the transaction is linked to a sending user and that this user is 'active'.

2.  `transactions_for_partition`: This takes the `relevant_transactions` and adds a new calculated field `tx_month_date`.
    *   `tx_month_date = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`: This function converts the `created_at` timestamp of each transaction to a datetime representing the first day of that transaction's month. This standardized date will be used for grouping.

3.  `monthly_summary`: This line performs the core aggregation.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(tx_month_date))`: Groups the `transactions_for_partition` data by the `tx_month_date`. Each group will contain all relevant transactions for a specific month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each monthly group:
        *   `month_as_date = tx_month_date`: Selects the month (which is already the start date of the month, fulfilling the ""month as a date"" requirement).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_id` values within each monthly group. `Transactions.sender_id` here refers to the `sender_id` of the transactions that belong to the current partition (i.e., specific month and met all prior filters).

Return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications.,SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM notifications WHERE type = 'transaction';,Ewallet,"To return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Notifications` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION')`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection and then filters it to retain only those notifications where the `notification_type` field is equal to `'TRANSACTION'`. This isolates notifications specifically related to transactions.
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""users_partitioned_by_id"", by=(user_id))`: After filtering, this partitions the remaining notifications. The `by=(user_id)` clause groups these notifications based on unique `user_id` values. The `name=""users_partitioned_by_id""` assigns a temporary name to these partitioned groups, though it's not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` in this simple case. The effect of partitioning by `user_id` is that we will operate on each distinct `user_id` once.
3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id=user_id)`: Finally, this selects the `user_id` from each partition.

5.  Use `TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())` to select the top 2 merchants based on the `total_amount` in descending order.
6.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to return the `merchant_name`, `total_num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount` for these top merchants.

        -   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME(""now"")) <= 150)`: Ensures the transaction occurred within the last 150 days. `DATETIME(""now"")` provides the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days.
    -   `total_amount=SUM(qualifying_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of amounts for the `qualifying_transactions`.

1.  **Identify Relevant Merchants and Their Latest Balances**:
    *   Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those that are 'active' and whose `category` field contains the string 'retail'.
    *   Ensure that these merchants have at least one balance record using `HAS(balances) == 1`.
    *   For each of these qualifying merchants, determine their most recent balance. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as the balance amount from the `MerchantBalances` record with the latest `updated_at` timestamp for that merchant.
    *   This is achieved by accessing the merchant's `balances` sub-collection, ranking the balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order (this ranking is done per merchant using `per=""Merchants""`), selecting the entry with rank 1 (the latest), and then extracting its `balance` value using `SINGULAR()`.
    *   This process results in a temporary collection, `active_merchants_latest_balances`, where each row corresponds to a qualifying merchant and contains their `latest_balance_amount`.

2.  **Calculate the Median Balance**:
    *   Using the `Ewallet` (top-level) context, calculate the median of all `latest_balance_amount` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` function will compute a single value representing the median wallet balance across all selected merchants. If any `latest_balance_amount` is null, it will be ignored in the median calculation.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection called `session_durations`.
    *   Inside `CALCULATE`, we select the `device_type`.
    *   We calculate `duration_seconds` for each session using the `DATEDIFF` function. `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` computes the difference between the session end time and start time in seconds.

2.  **`average_session_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `session_durations` collection (which now includes `duration_seconds`).
    *   We use `PARTITION` to group the sessions.
        *   `name=""sessions_by_device""`: This names the groups created by the partition.
        *   `by=(device_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the sessions based on their `device_type`.
    *   After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` again on these groups:
        *   We select the `device_type` (which is our partition key).
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_by_device.duration_seconds)`: For each `device_type` group, we calculate the average of the `duration_seconds` values. We access the `duration_seconds` from the partitioned data using `sessions_by_device.duration_seconds` (where `sessions_by_device` is the name we gave to our partition).
