1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate two aggregate values:
    *   The total number of transactions they've made (`num_total_transactions`).
    *   The number of successful transactions they've made (`num_successful_transactions`). We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` is ""Completed"".
3.  Filter these customers to include only those where `num_total_transactions` is 5 or more.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate their `success_rate` as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. We use `IFF` to handle potential division by zero, although the filter `num_total_transactions >= 5` already ensures the divisor is positive. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and uses floating-point arithmetic.
5.  Select the customer's name and their calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Order the final result by `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
# Step 1: Calculate total and successful transaction counts for each customer
customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(
    cust_name=name,
    total_trans_count=COUNT(transactions_made),
    successful_trans_count=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))

1.  **Define FAANG Ticker Symbols**: We'll create a list of the ticker symbols for FAANG companies ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX').
2.  **Filter Customers**: We'll access the `Customers` collection and apply filters:
    *   Ensure the customer's `email` ends with '.com' using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   Check if the customer has made any transactions (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` of the transacted stock is one of the FAANG symbols. This involves:
        *   Accessing the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   Filtering these transactions to include only those where `ticker.symbol` is in our defined FAANG list (using `ISIN`).
        *   Using the `HAS` function to verify that at least one such transaction exists for the customer.
3.  **Count Distinct Customers**: We'll count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. Since each record in the filtered `Customers` collection represents a distinct customer, a `COUNT` on this collection will give the desired number.
4.  **Format Output**: The final count will be presented as `num_distinct_customers` using a `Broker.CALCULATE` operation.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_meeting_criteria = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then filters it based on two conditions combined with a logical AND (`&`):
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, '.com')`: This condition checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string '.com'.
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`: This is a more complex condition:
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: Filters these transactions. For each transaction, it accesses its related `ticker` (which is a `Tickers` record) and then the `symbol` of that ticker. The `ISIN` function checks if this `symbol` is present in the `faang_symbols` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the preceding filtered list of transactions (i.e., FAANG stock transactions for the customer) is not empty (has at least one record).
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_distinct_customers = COUNT(customers_meeting_criteria))`:
    *   This line performs a calculation at the `Broker` (top) level.
    *   `COUNT(customers_meeting_criteria)`: Counts the number of records in the `customers_meeting_criteria` collection. Since each record in this collection represents a distinct customer who met all specified conditions, this count gives the total number of such distinct customers.

1.  **Identify Stock Transactions**: Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
2.  **Calculate Week Information**: For each stock transaction:
    *   Determine the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. The definition of ""start of week"" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the system's date configuration.
    *   Flag whether the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.
3.  **Filter for the Target Period**:
    *   Establish the current week's start date: `current_week_start_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Define the date range for the 8 weeks of interest:
        *   The most recent week to include is ""last week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-1 week')`.
        *   The oldest week to include is ""8 weeks ago from the current week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-8 weeks')`.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

    *   Calculate the start of last week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week: `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to define two helper variables:

    *   `_start_of_last_week_dt`: Stores the timestamp for the beginning of the previous week.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` clause computes the final results:
    *   `num_of_transactions`:
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")`: Filters for customers whose country is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made`: Accesses the transactions made by these USA customers.
        *   `.WHERE((date_time >= _start_of_last_week_dt) & (date_time < _start_of_current_week_dt))`: Filters these transactions to include only those that occurred on or after the start of last week and before the start of the current week.

    *   `total_trans_amount`:
        *   The filtering logic is identical to `num_of_transactions` to identify the same set of transactions.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these amounts.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with `transaction_type` as ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred within the last 10 days from the current date. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10` for this, meaning the difference between the transaction date and now is 10 days or less.
3.  For these filtered transactions, we extract the `ticker.symbol` and assign it to `ticker_symbol_for_grouping`. This field will be used for grouping.
4.  We then `PARTITION` the filtered transactions by `ticker_symbol_for_grouping`.
5.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we `CALCULATE` the ticker symbol itself (renaming `ticker_symbol_for_grouping` to `ticker_symbol` for the output) and count the number of transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`. This count represents the number of buy transactions for that specific ticker in the last 10 days.
6.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need to identify customers whose `join_date` falls within the last 6 full months prior to the current month.
    *   `start_of_current_month`: This will be the first day of the current month.
    *   `start_of_lookback_period`: This will be the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month.
    *   The relevant `join_date` range will be `>= start_of_lookback_period` and `< start_of_current_month`.

2.  **Prepare Customer Data**:
    *   Filter `Customers` based on the `join_date` falling into the defined time window.
    *   For these customers, extract the year and month of their `join_date` to be used for grouping. Let's call these `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`.

3.  **Partition by Signup Month**:
    *   Group the filtered customers by `signup_yr` and `signup_mth` using the `PARTITION` function.

4.  **Calculate Metrics (PMCS and PMAT)**:
    *   For each group (i.e., each signup month):
        *   **PMCS**: Count the number of customers in that group. This can be done using `COUNT(Customers)`.
        *   **PMAT**: Calculate the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in that group. This can be done using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This will average over all individual transaction amounts from the customers who signed up in that specific month.

5.  **Order Results**: Optionally, order the results by signup year and month for better readability.

```python
# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions
start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
start_of_lookback_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month` and `start_of_lookback_period`: These variables define the date range for customer signups. `start_of_lookback_period` marks the beginning of the 6-month window (e.g., if today is July 15th, this would be January 1st). `start_of_current_month` marks the end of this window (exclusive, e.g., July 1st).
2.  `customers_with_signup_info`: We first access the `Customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to add new fields `signup_yr` (year of join date) and `signup_mth` (month of join date), while also keeping `cust_join_date` (the original join date) for filtering.
3.  `filtered_customers_for_period`: This step filters the augmented customer data to include only those customers whose `cust_join_date` falls within our defined 6-month window.
4.  `customer_signup_monthly_groups`: The filtered customers are then partitioned into groups based on their `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`. Each group represents a cohort of customers who signed up in the same month.
5.  `monthly_metrics`: For each `monthly_signup_cohort` (partition):
    *   `signup_year` and `signup_month` are carried over from the partition keys.
    *   `pmcs` (Per Month Customer Signups) is calculated as `COUNT(Customers)`, which counts the number of customers in the current signup cohort.
    *   `pmat` (Per Month Average Transaction Amount) is calculated as `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions made by the customers in the current signup cohort and computes the average of their `amount` values.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `signup_year` and `signup_month` for clarity.",56.611801862716675,"# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `active_with_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer's status is ""active"" AND they have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). Otherwise, it's `False`.
    *   `has_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer has made at least one transaction. Otherwise, it's `False`.
3.  We then partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `active_with_tx_bool` flag. This counts customers who are active and have transactions. This forms the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `num_total_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `has_tx_bool` flag. This counts all customers who have transactions. This forms the denominator of the AR formula.
    (We assume `SUM` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, consistent with PyDough examples like `SUM(cust_info.is_active)`).
5.  Finally, we calculate the Activity Ratio (AR) using the provided formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `num_total_customers_with_transactions` is zero (i.e., no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), setting AR to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

Here's the PyDough code to find the number of customers matching your criteria:

```python
filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

        Customers.WHERE(

            ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We are calculating a new field called `num_customers`. The value of this field will be the count of customers who meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` starts with 'j'.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` ends with 'ez'.
6.  **`(... | ...)`**: The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions, so a customer matches if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `state` ends with 'a'.
8.  **`(... & ...)`**: The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition (already an OR) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.
9.  **`LOWER(...)`**: The `LOWER` function is used on both `name` and `state` fields to ensure the comparisons are case-insensitive as requested.",11.830718278884888,"filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll start by accessing the `Transactions` collection. We then filter these transactions to include only those that:
    *   Are of `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred within the last month. The date range is from exactly one month ago up to the current moment (`now`). This is achieved using `date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` and `date_time <= DATETIME('now')`.
2.  **Prepare Data for Aggregation**: For the filtered transactions, we calculate:
    *   `ticker_symbol_val`: The symbol of the ticker associated with the transaction, which will be used for grouping.
    *   `current_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
    *   `current_charges`: The sum of `tax` and `commission` for the transaction.
3.  **Group by Ticker and Aggregate**: We then `PARTITION` the prepared transaction data by `ticker_symbol_val`. For each ticker group:
    *   `total_amount_from_sells`: We sum `current_amount` for all transactions in that group.
    *   `total_tax_plus_commission`: We sum `current_charges` for all transactions in that group.
4.  **Calculate SPM**: Finally, using the aggregated values for each ticker, we calculate the SPM according to the provided formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_tax_plus_commission) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `total_amount_from_sells` is zero to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to `0.0` in such instances.
5.  **Select Output Fields**: The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `SPM`.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",112.98786568641663,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

2.  `filtered_prices`: It filters these records using `WHERE` to retain only those where `price_date` falls between ""2023-04-01"" and ""2023-04-04"", inclusive.
3.  `stock_performance_summary`: It then partitions the `filtered_prices` by `ticker_id` and `ticker_symbol`. For each distinct stock (each partition group named `stock_group`), it calculates the `overall_min_low` (the minimum of `low_price` within that group over the period) and `overall_max_high` (the maximum of `high_price`).
4.  `stock_price_changes`: This step calculates the `price_change_value` for each stock by subtracting `overall_min_low` from `overall_max_high`.
5.  `top_3_stocks_by_price_change`: It uses `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_value.DESC())` to select the 3 stocks with the highest `price_change_value`.
6.  `result`: Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` to output only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `price_change` for these top 3 stocks.",41.67236542701721,"# Step 1 & 2: Access DailyPrices and include ticker symbol, date, low, and high

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, we calculate:
    *   `customer_id_val=_id`: The customer's ID.
    *   `customer_name_val=name`: The customer's name.
    *   `num_tx_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This counts the transactions for the current customer that satisfy a specific condition.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions made in the same month and year as the customer's `join_date` are counted. `date_time` refers to the transaction's timestamp, and `join_date` refers to the customer's signup date.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_tx_in_join_month.DESC())`: After calculating `num_tx_in_join_month` for all customers, this operation selects the top 1 customer based on this count in descending order. This effectively gives us the customer with the highest number of transactions in their signup month.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=customer_id_val, name=customer_name_val, number_of_transactions=num_tx_in_join_month)`: This final step takes the data for the top customer and formats it as requested, renaming `customer_id_val` to `_id`, `customer_name_val` to `name`, and `num_tx_in_join_month` to `number_of_transactions`.",49.99046277999878,"# Step 1: For each customer, calculate their _id, name, and the number of transactions

2.  Filter these tickers to find those that have at least one associated `DailyPrices` record (via the `historical_prices` sub-collection) meeting the date condition. The `HAS` function is suitable for this.
3.  The date condition is that the `date` of the daily price record must be on or after April 1, 2023. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to check this: `DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0`.
4.  For the tickers that satisfy this condition, select their unique identifier (`_id`) and present it as `ticker_id`.

2.  `HAS(historical_prices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0)) == 1`: This is the main filtering condition.
    *   `historical_prices` is a sub-collection of `Tickers` containing `DailyPrices` records for each ticker.
    *   `historical_prices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0)`: This filters the daily price records for each ticker, keeping only those where the `date` is on or after April 1, 2023.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date)` calculates the number of full days from ""2023-04-01"" to the `date` of the price record.
        *   If this difference is greater than or equal to 0, it means the `date` is on or after ""2023-04-01"".
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one record in the filtered `historical_prices` sub-collection. If a ticker has at least one daily price record satisfying the date condition, it passes this filter.
3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id)`: For the tickers that pass the filter, this part selects the `_id` field (which is the unique identifier for a ticker in the `Tickers` collection) and renames it to `ticker_id` in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields:
    *   `c_state`: Stores the state of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.state`).
    *   `t_type`: Stores the type of the ticker associated with the transaction (`ticker.ticker_type`).

2.  `state_ticker_combinations = transaction_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""state_type_groups"", by=(c_state, t_type))`: This groups the records from `transaction_info` based on unique combinations of `c_state` and `t_type`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=c_state, ticker_type=t_type, number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination) created by the partition:

        *   `ticker_type=t_type`: Selects the ticker type for the group.
        *   `number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions that fall into this specific combination of customer state and ticker type.

3.  `result = state_ticker_combinations.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the collection of state-ticker combinations (with their transaction counts) and selects the top 5.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total number of transactions).
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70)`**:
    *   This part filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and the current date.
    *   The `WHERE` clause keeps only those customers for whom this difference is less than or equal to 70 days (i.e., joined in the past 70 days).
3.  **`.transactions_made`**: After filtering the customers, this accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection for all these recently joined customers. This effectively gives a list of all transactions made by this group of customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This selects only customers who have at least one transaction. `HAS(transactions_made)` checks for the existence of records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: This includes the customer's original `_id` in the result.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: This calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This complex expression retrieves the date and time of the customer's first transaction:
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions.
                *   `RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"")`: Ranks the customer's transactions by their `date_time` in ascending order. The `per=""Customers""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer.
                *   `== 1`: Selects the transaction(s) with the earliest rank (i.e., the first transaction).
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the resulting collection (which should contain the single earliest transaction, or one of them if ties exist and `allow_ties` defaults to `False`) into a single record context.
            *   `.date_time`: Accesses the `date_time` field of that first transaction.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in January, February, or March of 2023 and had a status of ""successful"".
2.  Extract the month from the `date_time` of these filtered transactions.
3.  Group these transactions by the extracted month.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction `price`.
5.  The final result will show each month of Q1 2023 and its corresponding average transaction price.

# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 that were successful
# and extract the month number.
q1_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(
    (status == ""successful"") &
    (YEAR(date_time) == 2023) &

result = monthly_average_transaction_prices
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures we only consider transactions that were completed successfully.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitute the first quarter.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month_number = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, we create a new field `transaction_month_number` which stores the month of each transaction. The original `price` field from `Transactions` is implicitly available for later aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month_number))`: We then partition the filtered and augmented transactions into groups based on the `transaction_month_number`. Each group will contain all successful transactions for a specific month in Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month_number, average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each partition (i.e., for each month):
    *   `month = transaction_month_number`: We select the month number for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: We calculate the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` of the transactions belonging to the current partition.
5.  `result = monthly_average_transaction_prices`: The final result contains each month of Q1 2023 (as a number 1, 2, or 3) and the calculated average transaction price for successful transactions within that month.",33.6540846824646,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 that were successful

final_weekly_report = weekly_payment_summary.ORDER_BY(week_as_date.ASC())
```
**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    First, we establish the time frame of interest using `Dealership.CALCULATE`. `current_w_start_dt` marks the beginning of the current week (payments must be before this date). `eight_w_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of the 8-week period, calculated as 8 weeks prior to `current_w_start_dt` (payments must be on or after this date).

2.  **Filter Sales**:
    We select `Sales` records where `sale_price` exceeds $30,000. The date boundaries calculated in the previous step are implicitly available.

3.  **Filter Payments**:
    From the filtered high-value sales, we access their associated `payment` records. These payments are then filtered to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within our 8-week window (`>= eight_w_ago_start_dt` and `< current_w_start_dt`).

4.  **Augment Payment Data**:
    Each payment within the window is further processed using `CALCULATE` to add two new fields:
    *   `payment_week_start_dt`: Determined by truncating the `payment_date` to the start of its week using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend_day_payment`: A boolean flag, true if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, checked using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.

5.  **Group and Aggregate Payments by Week**:
    The augmented payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start_dt` using `PARTITION`. This groups all payments that occurred in the same calendar week.
    For each group (i.e., for each week):
    *   `week_as_date`: The start date of the week (taken from the partition key `payment_week_start_dt`).
    *   `total_payments_in_week`: The total number of payments in that week is counted using `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`.
    *   `weekend_payments_in_week`: The number of payments made on a weekend is calculated by summing `1` for each payment where `PaymentsReceived.is_weekend_day_payment` is true (using `SUM(IFF(..., 1, 0))`).

6.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the summarized weekly data is ordered by `week_as_date` in ascending order, presenting the report chronologically.

This query will return a list of weeks (represented by their start date) from the last 8 full calendar weeks (excluding the current one), along with the total number of payments and the count of weekend payments for sales over $30,000 in each of those weeks.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step:
    *   Select the `first_name` and `last_name` of the salesperson, aliasing them to temporary names (e.g., `sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`) because they will be used in a subsequent `CALCULATE`.
    *   Calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` sub-collection. This will be aliased to `calculated_total_sales`.
    *   Calculate the number of sales for each salesperson by counting the records in their `sales_made` sub-collection. This will be aliased to `calculated_num_sales`.
3.  In the second `CALCULATE` step:
    *   Pass through the `first_name` and `last_name` using their final requested names, referencing the temporary aliases from the previous step.
    *   Pass through the `total_sales_amount` and `number_of_sales` using their final requested names, referencing the calculated aliases from the previous step.
    *   Calculate the Sales Rank (`SR`) using the `RANKING()` window function. The ranking will be based on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order, which aligns with the definition of SR provided.
4.  Finally, order the results by `SR` in ascending order to list salespersons from highest rank (best sales) to lowest.

```
**Explanation:**

The query starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
-   `sp_first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
-   `sp_last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
-   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made` sub-collection).
-   `calculated_num_sales`: The count of all sales associated with the salesperson.

The second `CALCULATE` then uses these intermediate values to produce the final output:
-   `first_name`: Renamed from `sp_first_name`.
-   `last_name`: Renamed from `sp_last_name`.
-   `total_sales_amount`: Renamed from `calculated_total_sales`.
-   `number_of_sales`: Renamed from `calculated_num_sales`.
-   `SR`: The sales rank, calculated using the `RANKING()` function on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order. This means salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank number.

Finally, `ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())` sorts the resulting list of salespersons by their sales rank in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",43.981727838516235,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

1.  **Identify Cars with Known Inventory Status**: Start with the `Cars` collection. Filter for cars that have at least one entry in `inventory_snapshots`, as this is required to determine their latest inventory status. For each of these cars, calculate its make, model, and a boolean flag (`latest_inventory_status_bool`) indicating if it's currently in inventory based on its most recent snapshot. The most recent snapshot is found by ranking snapshots by `snapshot_date` in descending order and picking the top one.
2.  **Filter for Cars No Longer in Inventory**: From the above set of cars, filter further to retain only those where `latest_inventory_status_bool` is `False`. These are the cars confirmed to be no longer in inventory.
3.  **Get Sales Details for These Cars**: For the cars identified in step 2, access their `sale_records`. This effectively gives us all sales of cars that are confirmed to be no longer in inventory. For each sale, we extract the car's make and model (propagated from the parent car context) and the `sale_price` of that specific sale.
4.  **Group by Make and Model**: The resulting collection of individual sales (each with make, model, and price) is then partitioned by make and model.
5.  **Calculate Highest Sale Price per Group**: For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` among all sales in that group.
6.  **Order and Format Output**: Finally, order these grouped results by the calculated maximum sale price in descending order. The final output will include the make, model, and the highest sale price.

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
2.  **` (LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")) `**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase make name contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards, allowing ""ford"" to appear anywhere in the make name.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase model name contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The logical OR operator, so cars matching either condition are included.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this function is used to select the desired fields and calculate the average sale price for each car that met the criteria.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These select the specified car details.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within those sale records. The `AVG()` function aggregates these prices to compute the average for that specific car.

2.  **Identify Relevant Months**: We first find all unique months within this time window that have any sales activity at all. This forms the basis for our report, ensuring that we consider every month in the period that has data.
3.  **Filter Salespersons**: We are interested in salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023.

    *   Count the number of sales (PMSPS) made by the filtered salespersons.
    *   Sum the sale prices (PMSR) from sales made by the filtered salespersons.
    If a month had sales activity in general but none from the specified salespersons, PMSPS and PMSR for that month will correctly be 0.
5.  **Order Results**: The final output will be ordered by month in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_val` and `end_period_val` define the date range for the last six full months, excluding the current month. For example, if ""now"" is July 15th, 2024, this range would be from January 1st, 2024, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2024.
2.  `report_months_base`:
    *   First, we take all `Sales` and calculate `sale_month_dt` by truncating `sale_date` to the start of its month.
    *   We filter these to include only sales falling within our defined 6-month window (`start_period_val` to `end_period_val`).
    *   Then, we use `PARTITION` by `sale_month_dt` and `CALCULATE month_val = sale_month_dt` to get a distinct list of months within the window that had at least one sale (from any salesperson). This forms the set of months for our report.
3.  `result`:
    *   We iterate over each `month_val` from `report_months_base`.
    *   For each `month_val`, we calculate:
        *   `month`: This is simply `month_val`, representing the month of the report row.
        *   `PMSPS`: We count records in the `Sales` collection. These sales must satisfy two conditions:
            1.  Their `sale_date` (truncated to the month) matches the current `month_val`.
            2.  The sale was made by a salesperson whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
        *   `PMSR`: We sum the `sale_price` of sales records meeting the same two conditions as for `PMSPS`.
    *   If, for a given `month_val`, no sales meet these criteria (e.g., sales in that month were not by the specified salespersons), `COUNT` will be 0 and `SUM` will effectively be 0, satisfying the requirement to include months where metrics are 0.

- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- `AVG(Sales.WHERE(...).sale_price)` calculates the average sale price.
- `Sales.WHERE(...)` filters the `Sales` collection:

**Explanation:**

*   `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, which will produce a single row of results.
*   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the expression provided.

1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for all sales in 2023.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of the `cost` of each car sold in 2023. The cost of the car is accessed via `Sales.car.cost`.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The query will be performed on the `Dealership` graph level to aggregate data across all relevant sales.

```python

    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

    gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across multiple sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For each of these sales, it accesses the `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all filtered sales to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale, it navigates to the associated `Car` record (via `Sales.car`) and then accesses its `cost`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used because the GPM calculation depends on `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`, which were defined in the first `CALCULATE`.
5.  `gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100`: This line implements the GPM formula using the previously calculated totals. The result is assigned to `gpm_2023`.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to find sales where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `car` associated with each sale.
    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:
        *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.
        *   `model=car.model`: Retrieves the `model` of the car.
        *   `sale_price=sale_price`: Retrieves the `sale_price` from the sale record.

    *   `total sales amount` will be the `SUM` of `sale_price` from all their `sales_made`.
    *   `number of sales` will be the `COUNT` of their `sales_made`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 3 salespersons based on their calculated ASP in descending order.
4.  Finally, select and display the `first_name`, `last_name`, and the calculated `ASP` for these top 3 salespersons.

```python
top_3_salespersons_by_asp = Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1).CALCULATE(
    # Calculate intermediate fields for salesperson details and ASP components
    sp_first_name=first_name,

    # The WHERE clause ensures COUNT(sales_made) is not 0
    calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only salespersons who have at least one sale record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. The `HAS(sales_made) == 1` condition ensures that `COUNT(sales_made)` will be greater than zero, preventing division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this `CALCULATE` function computes new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Stores the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Stores the salesperson's last name.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP). `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` aggregates the total sales amount from all sales made by the salesperson, and `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the total number of sales.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This function takes the result from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 3 salespersons. The ranking is based on the `calculated_asp` field, in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the highest ASP are ranked first.
4.  `.CALCULATE(first_name=sp_first_name, last_name=sp_last_name, ASP=calculated_asp)`: This final `CALCULATE` function formats the output for the top 3 salespersons, selecting their first name, last name, and their calculated ASP, renaming them to the requested output field names.",25.23335862159729,"top_3_salespersons_by_asp = Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_car_keys = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved in the sale using `car.make` and `car.model`. These are stored as `car_make_key` and `car_model_key` respectively, which will be used for grouping. The original `sale_price` from each sale record is implicitly carried forward.

2.  `model_performance_metrics = sales_with_car_keys.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the records from `sales_with_car_keys` based on unique combinations of `car_make_key` and `car_model_key`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make = car_make_key, model = car_model_key, ...)`: For each group (each unique make and model):
        *   `make = car_make_key` and `model = car_model_key`: These lines select the make and model for the output.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records belonging to the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
        *   `total_sales = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records in the current make/model group, giving the total number of units sold for that model.

3.  `top_models_by_revenue = model_performance_metrics.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This takes the aggregated data for all car models and selects the top 5 based on the `total_revenue`, sorted in descending order.

4.  `result = top_models_by_revenue`: The final result is assigned to the variable `result`, containing the make, model, total sales count, and total revenue for the top 5 car models.",57.68965125083923,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales, augmenting with car make and model for partitioning.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, two new fields are derived for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: This extracts the `state` from the `customer` associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
        *   `q_start_date`: This determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the sale:
            *   Months 1, 2, 3 (Q1) map to ""2023-01-01"".
            *   Months 4, 5, 6 (Q2) map to ""2023-04-01"".
            *   Months 7, 8, 9 (Q3) map to ""2023-07-01"".
            *   Months 10, 11, 12 (Q4) map to ""2023-10-01"".
    *   The `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records is implicitly available for aggregation in the next step.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`result`):**
    *   The `sales_data_for_partition` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""quarterly_sales_groups"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   After partitioning, another `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_start_date = q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_sales = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific customer state and quarter. The `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records belonging to each partition group.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",53.36214256286621,"# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

    a.  Accessing the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for the current drug.
    b.  Filtering these treatments to include only those where `end_dt` is not null, as specified in the DDD definition.

    d.  Further filter these treatments to include only those where `treatment_duration_days` is greater than 0. This ensures the treatment had a positive duration and avoids division by zero when calculating DDD.
    e.  For each valid treatment, calculate its individual DDD value using the formula: `ddd_for_this_treatment = tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    f.  The `AVG` aggregation function is then used on the collection of these `ddd_for_this_treatment` values to compute the average DDD for the current drug.
3.  The final result will include the `drug_name` and the calculated `avg_ddd_value`.

        ).ddd_for_this_treatment  # Project the calculated DDDs for AVG function
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code starts by iterating through each record in the `Drugs` collection.

For each drug:
-   It selects the `drug_name`.
-   It calculates `avg_ddd_value` using the `AVG` aggregation function. The input to `AVG` is a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`).
-   The process to get these individual DDD values is as follows:
    1.  `treatments_used_in.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments to only include those where `end_dt` is present (not null).
    2.  `.CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For these filtered treatments, it calculates the duration in days between `start_dt` and `end_dt`.
    3.  `.WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`: It further filters the treatments to ensure the calculated `treatment_duration_days` is positive, preventing division by zero and ensuring meaningful DDDs.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment=tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days)`: For treatments that pass both filters, it calculates the DDD using the formula `tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    5.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values, forming a collection of numbers that `AVG` can then average.

The final output `drug_avg_ddd` will contain each drug's name and its corresponding average DDD. If a drug has no valid treatments to calculate DDD (e.g., all treatments have null `end_dt` or zero/negative duration), its `avg_ddd_value` will typically be null.",41.74776887893677,"drug_avg_ddd = Drugs.CALCULATE(

2.  **Filter Treatments**: Select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this three-month period.
3.  **Enhance Treatment Data**: For each selected treatment, determine:
    *   The year and month of the treatment (`treatment_month_year_str`) for grouping.
    *   A flag (`is_biologic_treatment`) indicating if the treatment used a biologic drug (where `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`).
4.  **Group by Month**: Partition the enhanced treatment data by `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month's partition:
    *   Count the total number of distinct patients (`distinct_patient_count`).
    *   Count the number of distinct patients who received at least one biologic treatment in that month (`biologic_treatment_patient_count`). This uses `KEEP_IF` to consider only patients associated with biologic treatments for the distinct count.
6.  **Order Results**: Sort the final results by month.

```
This PyDough code snippet will:
1.  Establish date boundaries for the last three full months using `DermTreatment` as the context.
2.  Filter `Treatments` to include only those starting within this period.
3.  For these treatments, it calculates a `treatment_month_year_str` (e.g., ""2023-07"") and an `is_biologic_treatment` flag.
4.  It then partitions these processed treatments by `treatment_month_year_str`.

1.  **Calculate Metrics per Doctor**: For each doctor, we first calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by accessing the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection, then the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the distinct drug identifiers (`drug_id`). This result is stored in an intermediate collection `doctor_metrics`.

2.  **Partition Doctors by Specialty**: We then partition the `doctor_metrics` collection by the `speciality` field. This groups doctors based on their specialty. Each group (partition) is named `specialty_group`.

3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**: For each `specialty_group` (i.e., for each specialty), we access the `Doctors` records belonging to that group. For these doctors, we then:
    *   Select the required fields: `doc_id` and `speciality`.
    *   Use the previously calculated count of distinct drugs, renaming it to `number_of_distinct_drugs` for the final output.
    *   Calculate `SDRSDR` (Specialty Drug Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `by` the number of distinct drugs in descending order (so more drugs mean a better/lower rank number, e.g., rank 1) and `per=""specialty_group""` ensures the rank is calculated independently within each specialty.

This approach ensures that each doctor's rank is relative to other doctors within the same specialty.

For example, if the current date is July 15, 2024, the window will span from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each selected treatment, we extract the year and month from its `start_dt`. These will serve as keys for grouping. This step effectively truncates the `start_dt` to the month level as requested.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the filtered and prepared treatments by year and month. This creates distinct groups, each representing one month within our 12-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each monthly group, we count the number of unique `patient_id` values associated with the treatments in that month. This represents the number of distinct patients who received a diagnosis (as implied by a treatment record) during that month.

-   `.patient`: For each treatment in that list, this accesses the corresponding patient record. This results in a collection of patients who were treated with 'Drugalin'.
-   `.weight_kg`: From this collection of patients, this accesses their `weight_kg` attribute, resulting in a collection of weights.

1.  **Identify Each Patient's First Treatment**: For each patient, find all treatments they've received (`Patients.treatments_received`). Then, rank these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The treatment with rank 1 is the patient's first-ever treatment.
2.  **Filter for First Treatments**: Keep only those treatments that are identified as a patient's first treatment. Each record at this stage represents a patient becoming ""new"" to the system.
3.  **Determine Year of First Treatment**: For each of these first treatments, extract the year from its `start_dt`. This is the year the patient became a ""new patient"".
4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function is used here. For the earliest year in the data, NPI will be `None` as there's no preceding year for comparison.

Here's the PyDough code:

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year. If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the data), `PREV` returns `None`, making the `npi` also `None`.",86.58913064002991,"# Step 1: Access treatments for each patient and rank them by start date

2.  **Calculate Average Scores**: Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` from these filtered records. This will be done at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level to get overall averages.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`: This line defines a subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It filters records to include only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (not null). The `HAS(field_name)==1` construct is used to check for non-null values.
2.  `avg_scores_calc`: This calculation is performed on the `DermTreatment` graph, ensuring global averages.
    *   `avg_day7_pasi_val`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
    *   `avg_day100_pasi_val`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
3.  `overall_d7d100pir`: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the D7D100PIR.
    *   It uses the `avg_day7_pasi_val` and `avg_day100_pasi_val` computed previously.
    *   The `IFF` function checks if `avg_day7_pasi_val` is zero. If it is, `None` (null) is returned to prevent division by zero. Otherwise, the D7D100PIR formula `(avg_day100_pasi_val - avg_day7_pasi_val) / avg_day7_pasi_val * 100.0` is applied. The multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a float representing the percentage.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to count the relevant adverse events. To do this:
    a.  Access the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for the current drug.
    b.  For each treatment in `treatments_used_in`, calculate the year (`treatment_start_yr`) and month (`treatment_start_mth`) of its `start_dt`. This is done using an inner `CALCULATE`.
    c.  Access the `adverse_events` sub-collection for each of these treatments.
    d.  Filter these `adverse_events` to include only those where the `YEAR(reported_dt)` and `MONTH(reported_dt)` match the `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` of their parent treatment, respectively.
    e.  The `COUNT` aggregation function then sums up all such filtered adverse events across all treatments associated with the current drug. This gives `num_adverse_events`.
3.  The outer `CALCULATE` selects the `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and the calculated `num_adverse_events` for each drug.
4.  Finally, `TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events.DESC())` is used to select the single drug with the highest count of these relevant adverse events.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have prescribed at least one treatment where the drug used is of type 'Biologic'. This involves checking the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection and, for each treatment, the `drug` associated with it, and then the `drug_type` of that drug.

3.  From the filtered list of doctors, select their `loc_state`. This might result in a list with duplicate states if multiple doctors are from the same state.

It also requires the count of distinct patients for each of these insurance types.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)`.
    *   For these filtered treatments, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve the patient's insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) and the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`). These are stored as `ins_type_val` and `patient_id_val` respectively. The `day100_pasi_score` will be accessed later from the `outcome_records`.

2.  **Group by Insurance Type**:
    *   The prepared treatment data (`treatments_info`) is then partitioned by `ins_type_val` using `PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(ins_type_val))`. This groups all treatments belonging to the same insurance type.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates per Insurance Type**:
    *   For each insurance group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `insurance_type_name`: The name of the insurance type (from `ins_type_val`).
        *   `avg_day100_pasi`: The average `day100_pasi_score`. This is calculated by `AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`, which averages all `day100_pasi_score` values from all `outcome_records` associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients`: The number of distinct patients. This is calculated by `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_val)`, counting the unique `patient_id_val` values within the current insurance type group.

4.  **Select Top 5 Insurance Types**:
    *   The resulting summary (`insurance_summary`) is then processed by `TOP_K(5, by=avg_day100_pasi.ASC())`. This selects the top 5 insurance types, sorting them in ascending order based on their `avg_day100_pasi` (lowest average PASI score first).

The final result will contain the insurance type, its average day 100 PASI score, and the count of distinct patients for these top 5 insurance types.

    *   `== 1`: This ensures we only keep patients for whom the `HAS` condition is true.
3.  `.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, p_first_name=first_name, p_last_name=last_name)`: For each patient who meets the `WHERE` condition, this step selects the specified fields.

The approach is as follows:
1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  For each diagnosis, calculate:
    *   The diagnosis name (`diag_name`).
    *   The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score from its associated treatments and their outcome records. This is achieved using `MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`.
    *   The number of distinct patients treated for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`.
3.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The primary sorting criterion will be the maximum itch score in descending order. Diagnoses for which this score is not available (null) will be ranked last.
4.  Finally, select and rename the fields as requested: `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score`.

```python
result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate intermediate fields for each diagnosis
    diagnosis_name_val=diag_name,
    max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas),
    num_distinct_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)
).TOP_K(
    3, # Select top 3 diagnoses
    by=max_itch_score_val.DESC(na_pos='last') # Order by the calculated max itch score, highest first

    diagnosis_name=diagnosis_name_val,
    number_of_patients=num_distinct_patients_val,
    maximum_itch_score=max_itch_score_val
)
```
Explanation:
- The query starts by accessing the `Diagnoses` collection.
- In the first `CALCULATE` step, we compute three values for each diagnosis:
    - `diagnosis_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis, taken directly from the `diag_name` field.
    - `max_itch_score_val`: The highest `day100_itch_vas` score recorded across all outcome records associated with treatments for that particular diagnosis. This is found by navigating `treatments_for` (plural relationship to `Treatments`), then `outcome_records` (plural relationship from `Treatments` to `Outcomes`), and applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `day100_itch_vas` field.
    - `num_distinct_patients_val`: The count of unique patients who have received treatment for the diagnosis. This is determined by navigating `treatments_for`, then to the linked `patient` (singular relationship from `Treatments` to `Patients`), and using `NDISTINCT` on their `patient_id`.
- The `TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))` function then filters these results to keep only the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking is based on `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). The `na_pos='last'` argument ensures that any diagnoses without a `day100_itch_vas` score (resulting in a null `max_itch_score_val`) are placed at the end of the ranking and are less likely to be included in the top 3.
- Finally, the second `CALCULATE` step selects these three computed values and renames them to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested for the output.",49.61732864379883,"result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(

Return the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount.","SELECT d.specialty, COUNT(*) AS num_treatments, SUM(t.tot_drug_amt) AS total_drug_amt FROM treatments AS t JOIN doctors AS d ON t.doc_id = d.doc_id WHERE t.start_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months') GROUP BY d.specialty ORDER BY total_drug_amt DESC LIMIT 3;",DermTreatment,"The query aims to identify the top 3 doctor specialties based on the total drug amount they prescribed. This analysis is restricted to treatments that commenced within the last six calendar months. The final output should list the specialty, the total number of treatments administered by that specialty within the period, and the corresponding total drug amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is augmented using `CALCULATE` to include:
        *   `treatment_start_dt_calc`: The start date of the treatment, derived from the `start_dt` field.
        *   `doc_specialty_calc`: The specialty of the doctor who prescribed the treatment, accessed via `doctor.speciality`.
    *   Original fields like `tot_drug_amt` remain accessible.

2.  **Filter by Date**:
    *   The augmented treatment data is filtered using `WHERE` to include only treatments where `treatment_start_dt_calc` is on or after the start of the calendar month that was five months prior to the current month's start. This effectively covers the ""past 6 calendar months"" (e.g., if 'now' is July, this includes treatments from February 1st onwards).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-5 months')` calculates this boundary date.

3.  **Group by Specialty and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered `recent_treatments_info` collection is then partitioned by `doc_specialty_calc` using `PARTITION(name=""docs_by_specialty"", by=(doc_specialty_calc))`.
    *   Within each specialty group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The doctor's specialty (from `doc_specialty_calc`).
        *   `number_of_treatments`: The count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered period, obtained using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments by that specialty in the filtered period, obtained using `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`.

4.  **Select Top 3 Specialties**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_summary` to retrieve the top 3 specialties ranked by `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount for the top 3 specialties.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` to compute aggregated values for each `ins_type` group.
    *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` for each group and rename it to `insurance_type`.
    *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that specific `ins_type` group.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code addresses the request by performing the following steps:

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   It starts with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   For each drug, it calculates three new fields:
        *   `d_name`: Stores the `drug_name`.
        *   `n_treatments`: Counts the number of treatments associated with the drug using `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`. The `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection linking drugs to their treatments.
        *   `avg_d_amount`: Calculates the average total drug amount for all treatments associated with the drug using `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`. `tot_drug_amt` is a field in the `Treatments` collection. If a drug has no treatments, `COUNT` will be 0 and `AVG` will likely result in `NULL` (or be handled gracefully by the aggregation).

2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=n_treatments.DESC())`**:
    *   This function selects the top 5 drugs.
    *   The ranking is determined by the `n_treatments` field in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning drugs with the highest number of treatments will be ranked higher. The phrase ""by number of treatments and average drug amount"" is interpreted as primarily ranking by the number of treatments, as `TOP_K`'s `by` parameter typically takes a single primary sorting expression.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Finally, this selects and renames the fields for the output, as requested:
        *   `drug_name`: From the calculated `d_name`.
        *   `number_of_treatments`: From the calculated `n_treatments`.
        *   `average_drug_amount`: From the calculated `avg_d_amount`.

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three conditions:
    *   The associated diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive, wildcard match). This is achieved using `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`.
    *   The drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date, indicating it's FDA-approved. This is checked using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   The treatment's end date (`end_dt`) is within the last 6 months from the current date. This is checked by ensuring `end_dt` exists, is greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`), and is less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`).
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions using `COUNT()`.
4.  The final count will be presented as a field in a `CALCULATE` operation on the `DermTreatment` graph.

```python
# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, drug approval, and end date
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(

# Calculate the total count of such treatments
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    count_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition filters treatments where the `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` contains the substring ""psoriasis"". `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `%` are wildcards for matching any sequence of characters.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the `drug` associated with the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`), implying it is FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition filters treatments that ended on or after the date 6 months prior to the current date. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition filters treatments that ended on or before the current date.
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so a treatment must satisfy all of them.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(count_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result. We use the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to perform a `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_treatments)` counts the number of treatment records that remained after applying all the filters defined in the `filtered_treatments` expression.

2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE(is_placebo == True)` to select only placebo treatments.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each selected placebo treatment.

5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To find the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we need to perform the following steps:
1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (obtained using `DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  Round the resulting average age to the nearest integer using the `ROUND` function with 0 decimal places.
6.  The final result will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to compute this.

Explanation:
-   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want to compute a single aggregated value over the entire dataset.
-   `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'private'))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only male patients who have 'private' insurance. We assume 'private' is the value stored in the `ins_type` field for private insurance.
-   `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age.
    -   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This effectively gives the age in integer years.
    -   The result of this calculation is stored in a temporary field `current_age_in_years`.
-   `.current_age_in_years`: This accesses the calculated ages for the `AVG` function.
-   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients who met the filter criteria.
-   `ROUND(..., 0)`: This rounds the calculated average age to 0 decimal places, effectively providing an integer result as requested.
-   The final average age is assigned to the field `avg_male_patient_age_private_ins`.",31.42279314994812,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, calculate two intermediate values:
    *   `distinct_coupons_count`: The number of distinct coupons used in successful transactions. This is found by filtering the merchant's `transactions_received` for those with `status == ""completed""` and where a coupon was used (`HAS(coupon) == 1`), then counting the distinct `coupon.cid`.
    *   `distinct_transactions_count`: The number of distinct successful transactions. This is found by filtering the merchant's `transactions_received` for those with `status == ""completed""`, then counting the distinct `txid`.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, compute the `CPUR` by dividing `distinct_coupons_count` by `distinct_transactions_count`.
4.  Use the `IFF` function to handle cases where `distinct_transactions_count` is zero (to prevent division by zero), defaulting `CPUR` to `0.0` in such instances.
5.  The final result will include the merchant's name (`name`) and the calculated `CPUR`.

        *   Accesses `transactions_received` for each merchant.
        *   Filters these transactions using `WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`. This keeps only transactions that are ""completed"" (assumed successful) AND have an associated coupon.

2.  `cpur_for_merchants = merchant_transaction_data.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the result from the previous `CALCULATE` step (`merchant_transaction_data`) and performs further calculations.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: Passes through the merchant's name.
    *   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `IFF(distinct_transactions_count > 0, ...)`: Checks if the count of distinct successful transactions is greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors.
        *   `distinct_coupons_count / distinct_transactions_count`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to distinct successful transactions.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter Recent Balances**: It first filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of 7 days ago. This is done using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7`.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**:
    *   The filtered balances are then partitioned by `user_id`. This groups all recent balance entries for each user.
    *   For each user group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute `user_specific_amb = AVG(UserBalances.balance)`. This calculates the average balance for each specific user based on their balance entries from the past week, fulfilling the definition of AMB for that user over the specified period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, it calculates the average of all these `user_specific_amb` values. This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `user_specific_amb` field from the collection generated in the previous step. The result is stored in a field named `average_balance`.

1.  We start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we will calculate a new field called `LUB`.
3.  To determine the `LUB`, we look into the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user. These are `UserBalances` records, each having an `updated_at` timestamp and a `balance` amount.
4.  We use the `RANKING` window function on these `balances`. The ranking is performed `by` the `updated_at` field in descending order (`DESC()`), ensuring the most recent balance gets the top rank. The `per=""Users""` argument ensures this ranking is done independently for each user's set of balances.
5.  We then filter these ranked balances to keep only the one where `RANKING(...) == 1`, which corresponds to the latest balance entry.

This involves summing up the amounts from successfully received transactions where the merchant is the receiver and `receiver_type` is 1. Then, merchants are ranked based on this revenue.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant**:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue. This revenue is the sum of `amount` from their `transactions_received`.
    *   These transactions are filtered to include only those that were ""successfully received"" (assumed `status == ""completed""`) and where the `receiver_type` on the transaction record is 1 (as specified for merchants).
    *   The merchant's `name` and `category` are also selected. These intermediate results are stored in `merchant_data`.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Output**:
    *   Using the `merchant_data` (which now has `m_name`, `m_category`, and `m_revenue` for each merchant), we perform a second `CALCULATE`.
    *   We select the `merchant_name` (from `m_name`), `category` (from `m_category`), and `revenue_amount` (from `m_revenue`).
    *   The `revenue_rank` is computed using the `RANKING()` window function. It ranks merchants in descending order of their `m_revenue` (so rank 1 is the highest revenue), which aligns with the definition of MRR.
    *   The final result includes the merchant's name, category, their total revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

1.  **Determine the Date Range**: We need to identify transactions that occurred from the start of the month, two months prior to the current month, up to the start of the current month (exclusive). For example, if the current date is in July, we'll consider transactions from May 1st up to (but not including) July 1st.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this calculated date range and have a `sender_type` of 0, as per the PMDAU definition.
3.  **Extract Temporal Information**: For each relevant transaction, extract the year and month from its `created_at` timestamp. This is necessary for monthly aggregation. We also carry forward the `sender_id` for the distinct count.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the filtered transactions by year and month. For each year-month group, calculate the PMDAU by counting the number of distinct `sender_id`s.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by year and month for clarity.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the query:
# 'two_months_ago_start_date' is the beginning of the month that was two months ago (e.g., if today is July 15th, this will be May 1st).

# Order the results by year and then by month for a clear, chronological view.
final_pmdau_result = pmdau_calculation.ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `two_months_ago_start_date` and `current_month_start_date` are contextless expressions defining the time window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')` calculates the date for the start of the month that was two full months prior to the current month.
2.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified date range and were initiated by a sender of `sender_type = 0`.
3.  The first `CALCULATE` call on `relevant_transactions_for_pmdau` creates a new collection `transactions_with_month_info`. For each transaction, it adds `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` (extracted from `created_at`) and includes `sender_id` under the new name `sender_id_val`. This prepares the data for monthly aggregation.
4.  `PARTITION(name=""monthly_active_users_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))` groups the `transactions_with_month_info` data by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
5.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these monthly groups. It outputs `year_of_transaction` and `month_of_transaction` (which are the partitioning keys) and `pmdau`. The `pmdau` is calculated using `NDISTINCT(sender_id_val)`, which counts the unique sender IDs within each monthly group, fulfilling the PMDAU definition.
6.  Finally, `ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())` sorts the monthly PMDAU figures chronologically.",58.97687530517578,"# Define the date boundaries for the query:

1.  Start with the `Users` collection to process each user.
2.  For each user, calculate the sum of durations of their sessions that fall within the specified date range.
    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).
    *   Filter these sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01T00:00:00"" and before ""2023-06-08T00:00:00"".

    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).
5.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each user in the `Users` collection.
    *   `user_id_val = uid`: We store the user's unique identifier (`uid`) as `user_id_val`.
    *   `total_duration_val = SUM(...)`: For each user, we calculate the sum of session durations.
        *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the user's `sessions` (which are `UserSessions` records linked to this user) and filter them based on the `session_start_ts` to include only those within the range \[2023-06-01 00:00:00, 2023-06-08 00:00:00).
        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter this collection to select the merchant with `mid == 1`.
3.  Access the `coupons` sub-collection of this specific merchant.
4.  For each coupon in this sub-collection, calculate the sum of the `amount` from all transactions associated with it (via the `transaction_used_in` relationship).
5.  The final result will include the coupon's ID (`cid`) and the calculated total transaction amount.

```python
coupon_transaction_totals = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons.CALCULATE(

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection to select only the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is 1.
2.  `.coupons`: This accesses the `coupons` sub-collection associated with the filtered merchant. This gives us a list of all coupons offered by merchant 1.
3.  `.CALCULATE(coupon_id=cid, total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount))`: This operation is performed for each coupon obtained in the previous step.
    *   `coupon_id=cid`: It selects the `cid` (coupon ID) of the current coupon and renames it to `coupon_id` in the output.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: For the current coupon, it accesses its `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which lists all transactions where this coupon was used). It then calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all these transactions. This sum is named `total_amount` in the output.

1.  **Define the time window**: The ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" means we need to consider sessions that started from exactly one month before the current timestamp up to the current timestamp. We can define the start of this period using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
2.  **Access User Sessions**: We will use the `UserSessions` collection, which contains records of user sessions.
3.  **Filter Sessions**: We'll filter these sessions based on their `session_start_ts` to include only those that fall within our defined time window.
4.  **Count Sessions**: After filtering, we will count the number of resulting sessions.
5.  **Return the Count**: The final result will be a single value representing the total count, aliased as TUC.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the start of the time window: exactly one month ago from the current moment.
one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')

# Filter UserSessions to include only those started in the past month (inclusive of 1 month ago).
sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)

# The result is presented as a single value from the Ewallet context.
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a contextless expression. It calculates the timestamp corresponding to exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`). This timestamp will serve as the lower bound for our time window.
2.  `sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)`: This line accesses the `UserSessions` collection and filters its records. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is greater than or equal to `one_month_ago_ts`. This effectively selects all sessions that occurred from one month ago up to the present.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   It operates on the `Ewallet` (the high-level graph) context to produce a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)` counts the number of records in the `sessions_in_past_month` collection (which are the sessions that met our time window criteria).

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll calculate the start and end dates for the previous month based on the current date. The previous month starts on the first day of the month preceding the current month and ends on the last day of that same month (or, equivalently, just before the first day of the current month).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated ""previous month"" period using their `created_at` timestamp.
3.  **Identify Successful Transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`. This is a common convention, but if a different status indicates success, this condition should be adjusted.
4.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions that occurred in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (as defined above) within that same period.
5.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We'll ensure this is a floating-point division and handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).

We will use contextless expressions to define the date boundaries and the initial filtered set of transactions for clarity. The final result will be a single value representing the STR for the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `_prev_month_start_boundary`: This contextless expression calculates the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, this will be June 1st, 00:00:00.
2.  `_current_month_start_boundary`: This calculates the first moment of the current month (e.g., July 1st, 00:00:00). This serves as the exclusive upper bound for the ""previous month"" period.
3.  `_transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `_prev_month_start_boundary` and before `_current_month_start_boundary`.
4.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `_transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is `""completed""`.
    *   `num_total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions in `_transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  The second `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `str_value`: Computes the Success Transaction Rate. It uses `IFF` to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero. If there are transactions, it calculates the ratio; otherwise, it defaults to `0.0`. The `1.0 *` ensures the division results in a float.
6.  The final `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `previous_month_str = str_value`: This selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str` for the final output, ensuring the result contains just this single requested value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `m_id=mid, m_name=name`: We select the merchant's ID (`mid`) and `name`, renaming them to avoid conflicts and for clarity.
    *   `merchant_create_year=YEAR(created_at), merchant_create_month=MONTH(created_at)`: We extract the year and month of the merchant's creation date.
2.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` is then piped into a second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `m_id=m_id, m_name=m_name`: We carry forward the merchant's ID and name.
    *   `num_coupons_in_creation_month=COUNT(...)`: This is the core logic.
        *   `coupons.WHERE(...)`: We access the `coupons` sub-collection for the current merchant and filter them.
        *   `(YEAR(created_at) == merchant_create_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == merchant_create_month)`: This condition ensures that we only consider coupons whose creation year and month match the `merchant_create_year` and `merchant_create_month` (calculated in the previous step for the current merchant).
        *   `COUNT(...)`: We count how many coupons satisfy this condition for the current merchant.
3.  `merchant_coupon_info.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the collection of merchants (each now having the `num_coupons_in_creation_month` attribute) and selects the top 1 merchant.
    *   `by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC()`: The ranking is based on `num_coupons_in_creation_month` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest count comes first.
4.  `top_merchant_details.CALCULATE(...)`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table. It selects transactions that:
    *   Occurred in 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   Were initiated by a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
    *   Were successful (`status == ""successful""`).
    *   Were sent by a user who is currently marked as active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
2.  `transactions_with_month_and_user_id`: This `CALCULATE` step processes the `filtered_transactions`. For each transaction, it:
    *   Derives `transaction_month_asat_date` by taking the `created_at` timestamp and truncating it to the start of its month (e.g., ""2023-01-15 10:00:00"" becomes ""2023-01-01 00:00:00""). This provides a consistent date value for each month.
    *   Extracts `sender_user_uid` which is the `uid` of the `sending_user`. This ID will be used for counting distinct users.
3.  `monthly_distinct_active_users`: This is the core aggregation step.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_sends"", by=(transaction_month_asat_date))` groups the records from `transactions_with_month_and_user_id` based on the `transaction_month_asat_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., each month).
        *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_asat_date`: Selects the month (which is the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(transactions_with_month_and_user_id.sender_user_uid)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_user_uid` values within that month's group. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
4.  `result`: This line orders the `monthly_distinct_active_users` by `month_as_date` in ascending order, so the earliest month appears first.

**Explanation:**

*   `Coupons`: We start by accessing the `Coupons` collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new fields or select existing ones for each coupon.
    *   `coupon_code=code`: Selects the coupon's code and names it `coupon_code` in the output.
    *   `total_number_of_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each coupon (i.e., how many times it was redeemed) and names this field `total_number_of_redemptions`. The `transaction_used_in` is a sub-collection of `Coupons` linking to `Transactions`.
    *   `total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions where the coupon was used and names this field `total_amount_redeemed`.
*   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_number_of_redemptions.DESC())`: This function selects the top 3 coupons.

    *   `by=total_number_of_redemptions.DESC()`: Orders the coupons by the `total_number_of_redemptions` field (calculated in the previous step) in descending order, so the most frequently used coupons appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == 'active'`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, 'retail')`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   `HAS(balances) == 1`: Ensures that the selected merchants have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (i.e., they have `MerchantBalances` records).
2.  `.CALCULATE(latest_balance_value = ...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered merchants. For each such merchant, it calculates a new field named `latest_balance_value`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This accesses the `balances` sub-collection for the current merchant. It then ranks these balance records by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each merchant. The `WHERE` clause filters these to keep only the top-ranked (most recent) balance record.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should yield exactly one record (the most recent balance), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record.
    *   `.balance`: This extracts the `balance` amount from that single, most recent `MerchantBalances` record.
    *   The result of this `CALCULATE` step is a new collection where each record corresponds to a filtered merchant and contains their `latest_balance_value`.
3.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_wallet_balance = MEDIAN(...))`: This takes the collection of `latest_balance_value`s (obtained by `.latest_balance_value` from the previous step's result) and calculates their median.
    *   `MEDIAN(collection.attribute)`: The `MEDIAN` function computes the median value of the specified `attribute` across all records in the `collection`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only records where the `snapshot_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered 2023 snapshots.
    *   `tx_limit_daily_val = tx_limit_daily`, `tx_limit_monthly_val = tx_limit_monthly`: These expressions select the daily and monthly transaction limits, assigning them to new field names for clarity or further use.
    *   `date_rank = RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates a rank for each snapshot within the 2023 set. `by=snapshot_date.ASC()` orders them from earliest to latest. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest `snapshot_date`, they all receive rank 1.

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To find the average user session duration in seconds, split by device_type, we will perform the following steps:
1.  Access the `UserSessions` collection.
2.  For each session, calculate its duration in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts`. We also select the `device_type` for grouping.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `device_type`. This groups all sessions belonging to the same device type together.
4.  For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the session durations computed in step 2.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select its device_type.
# We rename device_type to p_device_type to clearly indicate it's prepared for partitioning.
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    p_device_type = device_type,

    # values for all records within the current partition group.
    avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line processes the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `p_device_type = device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for each session and assigns it to a new field `p_device_type`. This field will be used as the key for partitioning.
    *   `duration_in_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in the `duration_in_seconds` field.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_grouped_by_device"", by=(p_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `p_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type = p_device_type, avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds))`: This operation is performed for each group created by the `PARTITION`.
        *   `device_type = p_device_type`: Includes the `device_type` (which is the partition key `p_device_type`) in the final output.
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_in_seconds` field for all sessions within the current `sessions_grouped_by_device` group. The expression `sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds` refers to the collection of `duration_in_seconds` values for the records in that specific partition group.

The final `result` will contain one record for each `device_type`, showing the `device_type` and its corresponding `avg_session_duration_seconds`.",53.73459553718567,"# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select its device_type.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection and filter for those who have at least one coupon using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
2.  For each of these merchants, we need to find their registration date (`created_at`) and identify their earliest coupon. The earliest coupon can be found by taking their `coupons` sub-collection, ordering it by `start_date` in ascending order, and selecting the top one using `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`. We then use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this single coupon record as directly accessible. This information is captured in a `CALCULATE` step.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, we extract the `cid` (coupon ID) and `start_date` from the earliest coupon record obtained in the previous step.
4.  We then filter these merchants using a `WHERE` clause. The condition is that the earliest coupon's `start_date` must be within one year of the merchant's `created_at` (registration date). This is checked by ensuring that the difference in days, calculated by `DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant_registration_date, earliest_coupon_start_date)`, is between 0 and 365, inclusive. This means the coupon started on or after the registration date, but no later than one year after.
5.  Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: merchant ID (`mid`), registration date (`created_at`), the earliest coupon's ID (`cid`), and the earliest coupon's start date (`start_date`).

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, calculate two helper fields:

    *   `end_of_first_year_field`: This will be calculated as exactly one year after `user_signup_date_field` using the `DATETIME` function.
3.  Filter these users based on their notifications:
    *   A user is kept if they have *no* notifications whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the interval `[user_signup_date_field, end_of_first_year_field)`.
    *   This is achieved by using `HASNOT` on the `notifications` sub-collection. The sub-collection is first filtered to include only those notifications created on or after the user's signup date and strictly before the calculated `end_of_first_year_field`.
