1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate their total number of transactions and the number of successful transactions. We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is ""Completed"".
3.  Filter these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 total transactions.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate their success rate as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`.
5.  Select the customer's name and their calculated success rate.
6.  Order the results by the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
result = Customers.CALCULATE(
    c_name=name,
    num_total_trans=COUNT(transactions_made),
    num_successful_trans=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))

).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=c_name,
    success_rate=(num_successful_trans * 100.0) / num_total_trans
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_name=name`: Selects the customer's name and assigns it to `c_name`.
    *   `num_total_trans=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for each customer from their `transactions_made` list.
    *   `num_successful_trans=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This assumes ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction.

2.  `.WHERE(num_total_trans >= 5)`: This filters the results from the previous step, keeping only customers who have `num_total_trans` (total transactions) greater than or equal to 5.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the filtered customers, we calculate the final output fields.
    *   `customer_name=c_name`: Selects the customer's name for the final output.
    *   `success_rate=(num_successful_trans * 100.0) / num_total_trans`: Calculates the success rate as a percentage. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures floating-point division. Since `num_total_trans` is guaranteed to be at least 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause, division by zero is avoided.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`: Finally, the results are ordered by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).",32.07071256637573,"result = Customers.CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in conjunction with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol`.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering and then counting records from the `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, obtained by using `Broker.CALCULATE`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple of FAANG stock ticker symbols. This is a contextless expression used for better readability in the query.
2.  `com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`: This condition checks if the customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that involves a FAANG stock.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: This filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through `transactions_made.ticker.symbol`) is present in the `faang_tickers` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function returns true if the preceding filtered sub-collection (`transactions_made` for FAANG stocks) is not empty for the customer.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so a customer must satisfy both to be included.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_of_customers = COUNT(com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result. It uses the `Broker` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.

1.  **Identify Stock Transactions**: Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
2.  **Calculate Week Information**: For each stock transaction:
    *   Determine the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. The definition of ""start of week"" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the system's date configuration.
    *   Flag whether the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.
3.  **Filter for the Target Period**:
    *   Establish the current week's start date: `current_week_start_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Define the date range for the 8 weeks of interest:
        *   The most recent week to include is ""last week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-1 week')`.
        *   The oldest week to include is ""8 weeks ago from the current week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-8 weeks')`.
    *   Filter transactions whose calculated `week_start_dt` falls within this range.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**:

5.  **Order Results**: Order the final summary by week start date for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first calculate the start of the current week and the start of the last week. ""Last week"" is defined as the 7-day period starting from `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` up to, but not including, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions_last_week_usa)`: Counts the number of records in the `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa` collection.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step, we will:
    *   Select the customer's `name` and alias it as `customer_name`.
    *   Calculate the total number of transactions for each customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)` and alias it as `num_transactions`.
    *   Calculate the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)` and alias it as `total_trans_amount`.
3.  In the second `CALCULATE` step, we will:
    *   Include the `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` fields from the previous step.
    *   Calculate the `CR` (Customer Rank) using the `RANKING()` window function. The rank will be based on `total_trans_amount` in descending order. We'll set `allow_ties=True` so that customers with the same total transaction amount receive the same rank (standard ranking behavior).

```python
# Calculate basic aggregates: customer name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount for each customer.

    customer_name=name,
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)

**Explanation:**

*   The first `CALCULATE` call processes the `Customers` collection to compute `customer_name`, `num_transactions` (total count of transactions for that customer), and `total_trans_amount` (sum of amounts from all transactions for that customer).
*   The second `CALCULATE` call takes the output of the first one. It includes the previously calculated fields and adds a new field `CR`.
*   `CR` is determined by the `RANKING()` function, which ranks customers based on their `total_trans_amount`. `total_trans_amount.DESC()` ensures that customers with higher total transaction amounts get lower (better) rank numbers. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple customers have the same total transaction amount, they will share the same rank.",40.134907484054565,"# Calculate basic aggregates: customer name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount for each customer.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with `transaction_type` as ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred within the last 10 days from the current date. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10` for this, meaning the difference between the transaction date and now is 10 days or less.
3.  For these filtered transactions, we extract the `ticker.symbol` and assign it to `ticker_symbol_for_grouping`. This field will be used for grouping.
4.  We then `PARTITION` the filtered transactions by `ticker_symbol_for_grouping`.
5.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we `CALCULATE` the ticker symbol itself (renaming `ticker_symbol_for_grouping` to `ticker_symbol` for the output) and count the number of transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`. This count represents the number of buy transactions for that specific ticker in the last 10 days.
6.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions.

The result will contain the ticker symbol and the corresponding number of buy transactions.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined 6-month window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month and Year**: For these filtered customers, we extract the year and month of their `join_date`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_boundary` and `six_months_ago_start_boundary` define the date range for customer signups. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gets the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` gets the first day of the month that was six months ago.
2.  `Customers.WHERE(...)` filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is within the last six full months (e.g., if today is July 15th, this includes customers who joined from January 1st up to, but not including, July 1st).
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))` extracts the year and month from the `join_date` for these customers.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_signup_cohorts"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))` groups these customers by the year and month they signed up.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the requested metrics for each group:
    *   `signup_month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", signup_year_val, LPAD(signup_month_val, 2, ""0""))`: Formats the signup year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January).
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers in each `monthly_signup_cohorts` group, giving the Per Month Customer Signups.
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: Calculates the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in each group. `Customers.transactions_made` accesses the related transactions. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, PMAT will be 0.0 instead of null.

2.  From these filtered records, we use `CALCULATE` to extract:
    *   The `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record (aliased as `tick_type`).
    *   The `close` price (aliased as `price_close`).
    This results in an intermediate collection named `daily_prices_filtered`.
3.  We then `PARTITION` the `daily_prices_filtered` collection by `tick_type`. This groups all the daily price records from the last 7 days by their respective ticker types.
4.  Finally, for each `tick_type` group (partition), we use `CALCULATE` to:

1.  **Filter Customers**: Select customers whose `join_date` is in the year 2022.
2.  **Prepare Data for Aggregation**: For these filtered customers, create two boolean flags:
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (i.e., `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty).
    We also select the `country` to be used for partitioning.
3.  **Partition by Country**: Group the prepared customer data by their `country`.
4.  **Aggregate Counts per Country**: For each country group:
    *   Calculate `num_active_with_trans`: The number of customers who are active (`is_active_flag` is True) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True). This is the numerator for the AR.
    *   Calculate `num_total_with_trans`: The number of customers who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True). This is the denominator for the AR.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: For each country, compute AR using the formula: `(num_active_with_trans * 100.0) / num_total_with_trans`. If `num_total_with_trans` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to avoid division by zero errors.
6.  **Select Final Output**: Return the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_filtered_info`: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022. It then calculates three new fields for each of these customers:
    *   `cust_country`: The customer's country, which will be used as a key for grouping.
    *   `is_active_flag`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the customer's `status` is 'Active', and `False` otherwise.
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), and `False` otherwise.

2.  `country_aggregated_data`: This line takes `customers_filtered_info` and partitions it by `cust_country`. For each country group, it calculates:
    *   `output_country`: The name of the country for the current group.
    *   `num_active_with_trans`: The count of customers in that country group who are both active (`is_active_flag` is True) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True). This is achieved by summing `1` for each customer meeting the criteria (and `0` otherwise).
    *   `num_total_with_trans`: The count of customers in that country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True).

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the Activity Ratio (AR) for each country:
    *   It selects the `country` (from `output_country`).
    *   It calculates `AR` using the formula `(num_active_with_trans * 100.0) / num_total_with_trans`.
    *   The `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `num_total_with_trans` might be zero (i.e., no customers in that country group had transactions). In such cases, AR is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of customers meeting the criteria).
2.  **`number_of_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `number_of_customers` that will hold the count.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is used on the `name` and `state` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the first condition for the customer's name:
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two name conditions.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This part checks the second condition: if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
7.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name condition (itself a combination of two ORed conditions) and the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria.
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: After filtering, `COUNT()` counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy all the specified conditions.",13.368775844573975,"customer_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  Define the start of the ""past month"" period using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
2.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only ""sell"" transactions that occurred on or after this date.
3.  For these filtered transactions, calculate necessary fields: the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction amount (`amount`), and the combined costs (`tax + commission`).
4.  Partition these processed transactions by the ticker symbol.
5.  For each ticker symbol group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_amount_from_sells` by summing the `transaction_amount` for all transactions in that group.
    *   Calculate `total_transaction_costs` by summing the `transaction_costs` for all transactions in that group.
6.  Finally, calculate the SPM using the formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_transaction_costs) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `total_amount_from_sells` is zero to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` for SPM in such instances.

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly one month prior to the current moment. This will be used to filter transactions.
2.  `relevant_transactions_data = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time >= one_month_ago_date))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that are of `transaction_type` ""sell"" AND occurred on or after `one_month_ago_date`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate:
        *   `ticker_symbol_val = ticker.symbol`: Extracts the stock symbol associated with the transaction.
        *   `current_transaction_amount = amount`: Takes the transaction amount.
        *   `current_transaction_costs = tax + commission`: Calculates the sum of tax and commission for the transaction.
3.  `spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker = relevant_transactions_data.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the `relevant_transactions_data` by `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `name=""transactions_for_ticker""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(ticker_symbol_val)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol_output = ticker_symbol_val`: Carries over the ticker symbol.
        *   `total_sells_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_amount)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_amount` values for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
        *   `total_costs_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_costs)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_costs` for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
4.  `result = spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the SPM for each ticker.
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_output`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `SPM = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin.
        *   `IFF(total_sells_for_ticker == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This checks if `total_sells_for_ticker` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   `(total_sells_for_ticker - total_costs_for_ticker) / total_sells_for_ticker * 100.0`: If `total_sells_for_ticker` is not zero, this calculates the SPM according to the provided formula. The `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

1.  **Prepare Daily Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, calculate the ticker symbol (from the related `ticker` object), the year, and the month of the transaction. Also, keep the daily close, high, and low prices.
2.  **Group and Aggregate Monthly**:
    *   First, partition the prepared daily data by `ticker_symbol_field`. This creates groups for each unique ticker.
    *   Then, within each ticker group, partition by `year_field` and `month_field`. This creates subgroups for each month within each ticker.
    *   For each ticker-month subgroup, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price using the daily values. This results in a collection where each row represents a ticker's performance for a specific month.
3.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: On this monthly aggregated data:
    *   Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the *previous* month for the *same ticker*.
    *   The `PREV` function will operate `per=""ticker_level_group""` (the name of the partition by ticker) and will be ordered by year and month number to correctly identify the preceding month.
    *   If a month is the first one for a ticker, there's no previous month, so `PREV` will return a default value (e.g., `None`).
4.  **Calculate MoMC and Format Output**:
    *   With the current month's average close and the previous month's average close, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where the previous month's average close is `None` or zero to avoid errors.
    *   Format the month as 'YYYY-MM'.
    *   Select the required fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by ticker symbol alphabetically and then by month chronologically.

1.  Start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Create calculated fields for the ticker symbol (accessed via the `ticker` relationship), the date, high price, and low price. This makes them available as scalar fields for filtering and partitioning.
3.  Filter these records to include only those within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"" (inclusive).
4.  Partition the filtered data by the calculated ticker symbol. This groups all price records for each distinct stock.
5.  For each stock group (partition), calculate the maximum high price (`period_max_high`) and the minimum low price (`period_min_low`) observed during the specified date range.
6.  Calculate the `price_change_val` for each stock by subtracting `period_min_low` from `period_max_high`.
7.  Use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest `price_change_val`, ordering in descending order.
8.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to `ticker_symbol` and `price_change` for the output.

```python

1.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that occurred within the specified date range (January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023, inclusive). We'll use `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` to ensure the comparison is done at the day level, accommodating `date_time` fields that might include time components.
2.  **Partition by Transaction Type**: Group the filtered transactions by `transaction_type`.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each transaction type group:
    *   Count the number of distinct customers (`NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`).
    *   Calculate the average number of shares (`AVG(Transactions.shares)`).
4.  **Select Top 3**: Use `TOP_K` to get the top 3 transaction types based on the number of distinct customers, in descending order.
5.  **Return Requested Fields**: The final result will include `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `dated_transactions`: This variable stores transactions filtered to be within the date range of January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` function ensures that the time component of `date_time` is ignored, making the date comparison accurate for inclusivity.
2.  `type_summary`:
    *   We partition `dated_transactions` by `transaction_type`. This groups all transactions of the same type together.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
        *   `num_distinct_customers`: The count of unique `customer_id`s who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)` achieves this.
        *   `avg_shares`: The average number of `shares` for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG(Transactions.shares)` calculates this.
3.  `result`: This variable takes `type_summary` and applies `TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`. This sorts the transaction types by `num_distinct_customers` in descending order and selects the top 3, providing the transaction type, the count of distinct customers, and the average number of shares for each.",55.36009740829468,"# Step 1: Filter transactions by the specified date range.

**Explanation:**

1.  `ticker_transaction_summary = Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Tickers` collection.
    *   It calculates `num_transactions` by counting all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection for each ticker.
    *   It also calculates `total_transaction_amount` by summing the `amount` field from all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.
    *   The original `symbol` field from `Tickers` is implicitly carried forward.

2.  `top_10_tickers_by_total_amount = ticker_transaction_summary.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `TOP_K(10, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the `ticker_transaction_summary` and selects the top 10 records based on the `total_transaction_amount` field, sorted in descending order.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=symbol, number_of_transactions=num_transactions, total_transaction_amount=total_transaction_amount)`: This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:
        *   The `symbol` field (carried from the original `Tickers` collection) and renames it to `ticker_symbol`.
        *   The `num_transactions` field (calculated in the first step) and renames it to `number_of_transactions`.
        *   The `total_transaction_amount` field (calculated in the first step).

The result, `top_10_tickers_by_total_amount`, will contain the top 10 ticker symbols along with their respective number of transactions and total transaction amounts.",27.932496786117554,"# Calculate the number of transactions and total transaction amount for each ticker

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(cust_state=customer.state, tick_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create two new fields for each transaction:
        *   `cust_state`: Derived from `customer.state`, which is the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
        *   `tick_type`: Derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, which is the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `transaction_details.PARTITION(name=""state_ticker_combinations"", by=(cust_state, tick_type))`:
    *   We take the `transaction_details` collection (which now includes `cust_state` and `tick_type`).
    *   `PARTITION` groups these records based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. Each group is named `state_ticker_combinations`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`:
    *   This `CALCULATE` operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the customer state for the current group.
    *   `ticker_type=tick_type`: Selects the ticker type for the current group.
    *   `number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of original `Transactions` records that fall into the current combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

4.  `.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_prepared = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions in January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""completed""`: Filters for successful transactions. **Note:** We are assuming ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction. If ""successful"" corresponds to a different value in the `status` field, this condition should be adjusted.
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time), transaction_price_val = price)`: This selects and prepares the data needed for the next steps. It creates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from `date_time`, and it selects the `price`, renaming it to `transaction_price_val` for clarity.

2.  `monthly_average_prices = transactions_prepared.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `transactions_prepared` data and groups it.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups"", by=(transaction_month)`: Partitions the data by the `transaction_month`. Each group will correspond to a unique month (1, 2, or 3).
    *   `.CALCULATE(month_num = transaction_month, avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val))`: For each monthly group, this calculates:
        *   `month_num = transaction_month`: The month number for the group.
        *   `avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val)`: The average of `transaction_price_val` for all transactions within that specific month's group.

3.  `result = monthly_average_prices.CALCULATE(...)`: This line formats the final output.
    *   `month = month_num`: Selects the month number.
    *   `average_transaction_price = avg_price`: Selects the calculated average price and gives it the requested name.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Orders the final result by month in ascending order (January, February, March).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    First, we establish the time frame of interest using `Dealership.CALCULATE`. `current_w_start_dt` marks the beginning of the current week (payments must be before this date). `eight_w_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of the 8-week period, calculated as 8 weeks prior to `current_w_start_dt` (payments must be on or after this date).

2.  **Filter Sales**:
    We select `Sales` records where `sale_price` exceeds $30,000. The date boundaries calculated in the previous step are implicitly available.

3.  **Filter Payments**:
    From the filtered high-value sales, we access their associated `payment` records. These payments are then filtered to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within our 8-week window (`>= eight_w_ago_start_dt` and `< current_w_start_dt`).

4.  **Augment Payment Data**:
    Each payment within the window is further processed using `CALCULATE` to add two new fields:
    *   `payment_week_start_dt`: Determined by truncating the `payment_date` to the start of its week using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend_day_payment`: A boolean flag, true if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, checked using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.

5.  **Group and Aggregate Payments by Week**:
    The augmented payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start_dt` using `PARTITION`. This groups all payments that occurred in the same calendar week.
    For each group (i.e., for each week):
    *   `week_as_date`: The start date of the week (taken from the partition key `payment_week_start_dt`).
    *   `total_payments_in_week`: The total number of payments in that week is counted using `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`.
    *   `weekend_payments_in_week`: The number of payments made on a weekend is calculated by summing `1` for each payment where `PaymentsReceived.is_weekend_day_payment` is true (using `SUM(IFF(..., 1, 0))`).

6.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the summarized weekly data is ordered by `week_as_date` in ascending order, presenting the report chronologically.

This query will return a list of weeks (represented by their start date) from the last 8 full calendar weeks (excluding the current one), along with the total number of payments and the count of weekend payments for sales over $30,000 in each of those weeks.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the required metrics at the `Dealership` graph level.
- It first defines a common filter for `Sales` records:
    - `Sales.car.make == ""Toyota""`: Ensures only sales of Toyota cars are considered.
    - `DATEDIFF(""days"", Sales.sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: Filters sales to the last 30 days, including today. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days between the sale date and the current date. A value of 0 means the sale occurred today, and 29 means it occurred 29 days ago.
- `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales records that satisfy both conditions. This result is assigned to `number_of_sales`.
- `SUM(...).sale_price`: Sums the `sale_price` of the sales records that satisfy both conditions. This result is assigned to `total_revenue`.
The final output `result` will be a single record containing `number_of_sales` and `total_revenue` for Toyota cars sold in the specified period.",29.903799772262573,"result = Dealership.CALCULATE(

    *   `first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons.
    *   `total_sales_amount_calc=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: For each salesperson, it calculates the sum of `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (found in the `sales_made` sub-collection). This sum is stored as `total_sales_amount_calc`.
    *   `number_of_sales_calc=COUNT(sales_made)`: For each salesperson, it counts the number of sales records in their `sales_made` sub-collection. This count is stored as `number_of_sales_calc`.

2.  `result = sales_data.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the intermediate `sales_data` collection (which now includes `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount_calc`, and `number_of_sales_calc` for each salesperson).
    *   `first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: Passes through the names.
    *   `total_sales_amount=total_sales_amount_calc`: Renames `total_sales_amount_calc` to `total_sales_amount` for the final output.
    *   `number_of_sales=number_of_sales_calc`: Renames `number_of_sales_calc` to `number_of_sales` for the final output.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount_calc.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `total_sales_amount_calc` field, and `DESC()` ensures that the ranking is in descending order (higher sales amount gets a better rank, e.g., rank 1).

2.  For each sale, retrieve the car's `make`, `model`, and `sale_price`.

    *   Finding the most recent snapshot using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`.
    *   Extracting the `is_in_inventory` status from this latest snapshot.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_details_with_inventory_status`: We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection. For every sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (`car.make`, `car.model`), the `sale_price` of that transaction, and determine the car's `latest_inventory_status`.
    *   The `latest_inventory_status` is found by looking at the car's `inventory_snapshots`. We select the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`. `SINGULAR()` is used to access the fields of this single snapshot.
    *   `IFF(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots) == 1, ..., True)` handles cases where a car might not have any inventory snapshots. If snapshots exist, we use the latest one; otherwise, we default the status to `True` (in inventory), ensuring these cars are filtered out later.
2.  `sold_cars_not_in_inventory`: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only records where `latest_inventory_status` is `False`, meaning the car has been sold and is confirmed to be out of inventory based on its latest snapshot.
3.  `max_prices_by_make_model`: We then use `PARTITION` to group these filtered sales by `car_make_val` and `car_model_val`. Within each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination), we `CALCULATE` the final output fields:
    *   `make`: The car's make.
    *   `model`: The car's model.
    *   `highest_sale_price`: The maximum `current_sale_price` found among all sales for that specific make and model combination that met the criteria.
4.  `final_result`: Finally, we sort these grouped results using `ORDER_BY` on the `highest_sale_price` in descending order, as requested.",66.02550673484802,"# Step 1: For each sale, get car details (make, model), sale price, and its latest inventory status.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and then filter it.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""NewFord"", ""FordMotors""). `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"", allowing for case-insensitive partial matches.
    *   **`|`**: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains ""ford"" OR its model contains ""mustang"".

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each car that meets the filter criteria, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields directly from the `Cars` collection.
    *   **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car.
        *   `sale_records` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each car.
        *   `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)` computes the average of the `sale_price` from all sale records associated with that car. If a car has no sale records, the `AVG` function will typically result in `null` for `avg_sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates Per Month Salesperson Sales count (PMSPS) and Per Month Sales Revenue (PMSR) for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive), focusing on sales made in the last six full months (excluding the current month).

1.  **Date Boundaries Definition (`date_config`):**
    *   It first establishes the reporting period by calculating the start of the current month (`calc_current_month_start`) and the start of the month six months prior (`calc_report_period_start`). These values are calculated once at the `Dealership` (graph) level.

2.  **Salesperson Filtering (`hired_salespersons`):**
    *   It filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 and 2023, inclusive.

3.  **Sales Data Retrieval and Filtering (`all_sales_from_hired_persons`, `sales_for_period`):**
    *   It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection for the filtered salespersons.
    *   These sales records are then filtered to include only those with a `sale_date` falling within the defined six-month reporting window (i.e., on or after `calc_report_period_start` and before `calc_current_month_start`).

4.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   For each relevant sale, the `sale_date` is truncated to the start of its month (`sale_month_truncated`). This standardized month value will be used for grouping.
    *   The `sale_price` is carried over as `price_of_sale` to be used in sum aggregation.

5.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_metrics_calc`):**
    *   The prepared sales data is partitioned (grouped) by `sale_month_truncated`.
    *   For each month group, it calculates:
        *   `PMSPS_val`: The count of sales records (`COUNT(Sales)`) in that month.
        *   `PMSR_val`: The sum of `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month.
    *   The results are ordered by the month (`report_month_val`) in ascending order.

6.  **Final Output Formatting (`final_report_data`):**

- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We use the `AVG()` aggregation function on the `sale_price` of the `Sales` collection.
- The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only sales where:
    - The `YEAR(sale_date)` is 2023.
    - The `MONTH(sale_date)` is in the set (1, 2, 3), representing January, February, or March, using the `ISIN()` function.

1. Access each payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2. For each payment, find its corresponding sale record using the `sale_record` relationship.
3. Calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Compute the average of these day differences across all payments.
5. Round the final average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph to compute a single aggregate value.

1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  For these sales, calculate the total revenue, which is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  For these same sales, calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the `cost` of the cars sold. The cost of each car is accessed via the `car` relationship from the `Sales` collection to the `Cars` collection.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to get a single GPM value for all sales in 2023.

```python
result = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

)
```
Explanation:
The PyDough code performs the GPM calculation as follows:
1.  It starts with the `Dealership` collection, which represents the top-level graph.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` clause computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_2023`: This is the sum of `sale_price` for all records in the `Sales` collection where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
    *   `total_cost_2023`: This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales in 2023. It accesses `Sales.car.cost` to get the cost of each car sold.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause uses the previously calculated `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` to compute the `gpm_2023`.
    *   The formula `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100` is applied.
    *   An `IFF` condition is added to handle the case where `total_cost_2023` might be zero (e.g., if no sales occurred or costs were zero), preventing a division-by-zero error. In such a case, GPM is set to 0.
The final result is a single record with the field `gpm_2023` representing the Gross Profit Margin for car sales in 2023.",25.964128971099854,"result = Dealership.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change as follows:

1.  **Extract Date Parts**: First, it processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, it extracts the `pay_year` (year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (month of `payment_date`) using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions, respectively. This augmented data is stored in `payments_with_date_parts`.

2.  **Aggregate Monthly Payments**:
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` method to group the records in `payments_with_date_parts` by `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
    *   For each unique year-month group, it calculates `total_payments_this_month` by summing up the `payment_amount` of all payments belonging to that group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`. The result is stored in `monthly_aggregated_payments`.

3.  **Calculate MoM Change**:
    *   On the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection (which contains one record per year/month with total payments), it calculates the `mom_change`.
    *   The `mom_change` is computed as `total_payments_this_month - PREV(total_payments_this_month, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()))`.
    *   The `PREV()` function retrieves the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding record, determined by ordering records by `year_val` (ascending) and then `month_val` (ascending).
    *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV()` will return `None` (as there's no preceding month), resulting in `mom_change` being `None` for that first month.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the `final_monthly_payments_report` is ordered by `year` and then `month` in ascending order for a clear and chronological presentation.

"What is the TSC in the past 7 days, inclusive of today?TSC = Total Sales Count.","SELECT COUNT(_id) AS TSC FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Dealership,"To calculate the Total Sales Count (TSC) for the past 7 days, inclusive of today, we need to:
1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current moment. If this difference is less than or equal to 6, it means the sale occurred today or in the preceding 6 days, covering a total of 7 days.
3.  Count the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.
4.  Assign this count to the alias `TSC`.
5.  The query will be performed on the `Dealership` graph level to produce a single result.

```python
total_sales_count_last_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    TSC=COUNT(Sales.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6))
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `Dealership` collection to produce a single aggregated result.
2.  `TSC=COUNT(...)`: We define a new field `TSC` (Total Sales Count).
3.  `Sales.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Sales` collection and filter its records.
4.  `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    *   `<= 6`: This condition ensures that we include sales from today (0 days difference), yesterday (1 day difference), and so on, up to 6 days ago (6 days difference). This covers a total span of 7 days, inclusive of today.
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `Sales` records that meet the `WHERE` condition.",21.13135528564453,"total_sales_count_last_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(

3.  For each remaining salesperson, calculate their ASP. ASP is defined as `total sales amount / number of sales`.
    *   `total sales amount` can be calculated as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`.
    *   `number of sales` can be calculated as `COUNT(sales_made)`.
4.  Select the top 3 salespersons based on their calculated ASP in descending order. This is done using `TOP_K(3, by=asp_value.DESC())`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. This is crucial because ASP calculation involves division by the number of sales.
2.  `.CALCULATE(s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name, asp_value=(SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)))`:
    *   This step calculates new fields for each salesperson.

    *   `asp_value=(SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))` calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP). `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` gets the total monetary value of all sales made by the salesperson, and `COUNT(sales_made)` gets the total number of sales.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=asp_value.DESC())`: This takes the result from the previous step and selects the top 3 salespersons based on the `asp_value` in descending order (highest ASP first).

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(customer_state_val = customer.state)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   It calculates a new field `customer_state_val` by accessing the `state` of the related `customer` for each sale (`customer.state`).
    *   Fields like `sale_price` and `customer_id` from the `Sales` collection are implicitly carried forward.

2.  `state_summary = sales_info.PARTITION(name=""state_sales_group"", by=(customer_state_val)).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This partitions the `sales_info` data by the `customer_state_val`. Each partition (`state_sales_group`) contains all sales records for a particular state.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these state-level groups:
        *   `state_name_output = customer_state_val`:  Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
        *   `total_revenue_output = SUM(sales_info.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for the current state by summing the `sale_price` of all sales belonging to that state in the `sales_info` collection.
        *   `num_unique_customers_output = NDISTINCT(sales_info.customer_id)`: Counts the number of unique customers in the current state by finding the distinct `customer_id` values from sales records in that state.

3.  `top_states_result = state_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue_output.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the `state_summary` (which has one record per state with its total revenue and unique customer count) and selects the top 5 records based on `total_revenue_output` in descending order.

4.  `result = top_states_result.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This final step renames the fields from `top_states_result` to match the desired output: `state`, `unique_customers`, and `total_revenue`.",48.2237982749939,"# Step 1: Prepare sales data by calculating customer state.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection.

2.  `grouped_by_model = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: The `sales_with_details` collection is then partitioned. The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by unique combinations of `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model`. Each group is named `sales_per_model_group`.
3.  `model_summary = grouped_by_model.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**: We calculate the start and end dates of the full ISO week (Monday to Sunday) that occurred before the current week.
    *   The start of the previous ISO week is 7 days before the start of the current ISO week.
    *   The end of the previous ISO week is 1 day before the start of the current ISO week (i.e., the Sunday immediately preceding the current week's Monday).
2.  **Filter Payments**: We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Grouping**: For each filtered payment, we extract the date part (truncating any time component) from the `payment_date` field. This ensures that all payments on the same day are grouped together, regardless of the time they were recorded.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: We then partition these payments based on the extracted `day_of_payment` and the `payment_method`.
5.  **Calculate Daily Totals**: Within each partition (i.e., for each day and payment method combination), we sum the `payment_amount` to get the total amount received.
6.  **Format Output**: Finally, we select and rename the fields to present the payment date, payment method, and the corresponding total amount.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters sales to include only those made in the year 2023.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` derives two new fields for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: Stores the `state` from the linked `customer` record.
        *   `q_start_date`: Determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. This is done using nested `IFF` functions based on the month of the sale. String literals like ""2023-01-01"" are used to represent these dates.

2.  `result = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`: Groups the records from `sales_info` based on unique combinations of `c_state` (customer state) and `q_start_date` (quarter start date).
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=c_state, quarter_start_date=q_start_date, total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price))`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `customer_state=c_state`: Selects the customer state for the output.
        *   `quarter_start_date=q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the output.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific state and quarter group. `Sales.sale_price` refers to the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(customer_state.ASC(), quarter_start_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final result first by customer state in ascending order, and then by the quarter start date in ascending order. This ensures a structured and predictable output.

    d.  Further filter these treatments to include only those where `treatment_duration_days` is greater than 0. This ensures the treatment had a positive duration and avoids division by zero when calculating DDD.
    e.  For each valid treatment, calculate its individual DDD value using the formula: `ddd_for_this_treatment = tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    f.  The `AVG` aggregation function is then used on the collection of these `ddd_for_this_treatment` values to compute the average DDD for the current drug.

```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code starts by iterating through each record in the `Drugs` collection.

For each drug:
-   It selects the `drug_name`.
-   It calculates `avg_ddd_value` using the `AVG` aggregation function. The input to `AVG` is a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`).
-   The process to get these individual DDD values is as follows:
    1.  `treatments_used_in.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments to only include those where `end_dt` is present (not null).
    2.  `.CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For these filtered treatments, it calculates the duration in days between `start_dt` and `end_dt`.
    3.  `.WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`: It further filters the treatments to ensure the calculated `treatment_duration_days` is positive, preventing division by zero and ensuring meaningful DDDs.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment=tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days)`: For treatments that pass both filters, it calculates the DDD using the formula `tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    5.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values, forming a collection of numbers that `AVG` can then average.

The final output `drug_avg_ddd` will contain each drug's name and its corresponding average DDD. If a drug has no valid treatments to calculate DDD (e.g., all treatments have null `end_dt` or zero/negative duration), its `avg_ddd_value` will typically be null.",43.93435049057007,"drug_avg_ddd = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need to identify treatments that started in the three full months prior to the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `three_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month, three months before the current month.
    *   The relevant treatments will have `start_dt >= three_months_ago_start_dt` and `start_dt < current_month_start_dt`.

2.  **Prepare Treatment Data**: For each treatment within this time window:
    *   Extract the `patient_id`.
    *   Determine the month of treatment in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-01"") using its `start_dt`.
    *   Check if the treatment involved a biologic drug (`drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`).

3.  **Group by Month and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the prepared treatment data by the ""YYYY-MM"" month string.
    *   For each month:
        *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s. This is the `patient_count`.
        *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s for treatments that were biologic. This is the `biologic_treatment_count`.

4.  **Order Results**: Sort the results by month in ascending order.

The `LPAD` function for formatting the month string is assumed to be available as it appears in the provided PyDough examples.

```python
# Define the start of the current month and the start of the period 3 months ago
current_month_start_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
three_months_ago_start_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')

    patient_id = patient_id,  # Select patient_id from Treatments
    # Create a 'YYYY-MM' string for the treatment month
    treatment_month_year_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(start_dt), LPAD(MONTH(start_dt), 2, ""0"")),
    # Flag if the treatment used a biologic drug
    is_biologic_treatment = (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')

    biologic_treatment_count = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(patient_id, is_biologic_treatment == True))
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC()) # Order results by month
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_dt` and `three_months_ago_start_dt` define the time range for treatments: the three full calendar months preceding the current month.
2.  `Treatments.WHERE(...)` filters treatments to include only those starting within this defined three-month period.
3.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` processes these filtered treatments:
    *   `patient_id = patient_id`: Selects the `patient_id` for each treatment.
    *   `treatment_month_year_str = JOIN_STRINGS(...)`: Creates a string representation of the treatment month (e.g., ""2024-01"") from the `start_dt`. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment = (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')`: Checks if the drug used in the treatment is of type 'biologic' and creates a boolean flag.
4.  `treatments_info.PARTITION(...)`: Groups the processed treatment records by the `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  The final `CALCULATE` operates on each monthly group:
    *   `month = treatment_month_year_str`: Outputs the month string.
    *   `patient_count = NDISTINCT(patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id`s within that month's group.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(patient_id, is_biologic_treatment == True))`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id`s for whom `is_biologic_treatment` was true in that month's group. `KEEP_IF` returns `patient_id` only if the condition is met, otherwise null; `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique non-null `patient_id`s.

3.  Next, we `PARTITION` the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection by `speciality`. We name these partitions `specialty_group`.
4.  After partitioning, we access the items within each `specialty_group` (which are the records from `doctors_with_drug_counts` belonging to that specialty).

6.  In this final `CALCULATE`, we also compute `SDRSDR`. This is done using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `per=""specialty_group""` (meaning within each specialty), ordered by `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (so doctors prescribing more distinct drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., rank 1).

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first determine the relevant 12-month period. This period starts from the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current month and ends on the last day of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is July 15, 2024, the window will span from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each selected treatment, we extract the year and month from its `start_dt`. These will serve as keys for grouping. This step effectively truncates the `start_dt` to the month level as requested.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the filtered and prepared treatments by year and month. This creates distinct groups, each representing one month within our 12-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each monthly group, we count the number of unique `patient_id` values associated with the treatments in that month. This represents the number of distinct patients who received a diagnosis (as implied by a treatment record) during that month.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each monthly group, we count the total number of treatment records. This gives the total treatments administered in that month.
6.  **Format and Order**: We format the year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for clear presentation and order the results chronologically.

The final output will list each of the last 12 months along with its corresponding PMPD and PMTC values.

1.  **Identify First Treatment Year for Each Patient**: For each patient, we find the earliest start date of any treatment they received. The year of this date is considered the year they became a ""new patient"". We filter out patients who have never received any treatment.
2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: We group the patients by their ""first treatment year"" and count how many unique patients fall into each year. This gives us the number of new patients for each year.
3.  **Order by Year**: The yearly counts of new patients are then ordered chronologically by year. This is necessary for the next step, which involves comparing with the previous year.
4.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI (New Patients Increase) is calculated as the number of new patients in the current year minus the number of new patients in the previous year. For the earliest year in the dataset (which has no preceding year), the NPI will be equal to the number of new patients in that year (assuming zero new patients before that).

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`: This line starts with the `Patients` collection. It filters out patients who have no treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`. Then, for each remaining patient, it calculates `year_of_first_treatment` by finding the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` among all their `treatments_received` and extracting the year from that date.
2.  `new_patients_by_year`: This takes `patient_first_treatment_info` and partitions it by `year_of_first_treatment`. For each year group, it calculates:
    *   `year_val`: The year of the group.
    *   `num_new_patients_val`: The count of patients whose first treatment occurred in `year_val`. `COUNT(Patients)` counts the items (which originated from the `Patients` collection) within each partition.
3.  `ordered_new_patients_by_year`: This sorts the `new_patients_by_year` collection in ascending order based on `year_val`. This chronological ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function used in the next step.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` step produces the desired output:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `number_of_new_patients`: The count of new patients in that year.
    *   `NPI`: The New Patients Increase. This is calculated by subtracting the previous year's `num_new_patients_val` (obtained using `PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's `num_new_patients_val`.

1.  **Identify Relevant Outcomes**: Filter the `Outcomes` collection to include only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. This ensures that we only consider treatments/patients for whom both data points are available.
2.  **Calculate Average PASI Scores**: From this filtered set of outcomes, calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` and the average `day100_pasi_score` across all included records.

**Explanation:**

1.  `relevant_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))`
    *   This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. It creates a temporary collection named `relevant_outcomes` containing only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null.

3.  `overall_d7d100pir_result = average_pasi_scores_calc.CALCULATE(...)`
    *   This line takes the result from the previous step (`average_pasi_scores_calc`) and calculates the final D7D100PIR.
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = IFF(avg_pasi_d7 != 0, (avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0, None)`:

        *   `IFF(avg_pasi_d7 != 0, ..., None)` checks if `avg_pasi_d7` is not zero. If it is zero, the expression returns `None` to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, it computes the percentage.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.

This can be achieved using the `HAS` function in conjunction with a `WHERE` clause on the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection, checking the `drug.drug_type`.
3.  From this filtered list of doctors, we need to find the distinct states (`loc_state`). We can use the `PARTITION` method, grouping by `loc_state`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_prescribing_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1)`:
    *   We start with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1` checks if a doctor has at least one entry in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection that satisfies the inner condition.
    *   The inner condition `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')` filters the treatments to only those where the `drug_type` of the associated `drug` is 'Biologic'.
    *   So, this line selects all doctors who have prescribed at least one 'Biologic' drug.

2.  `distinct_doctor_states = doctors_prescribing_biologics.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state).CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)`:
    *   We take the `doctors_prescribing_biologics` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state)` groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. This effectively creates groups for each unique state.
    *   `.CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)` then creates a new collection where each row represents one of these unique states, with the column `doctor_state` containing the name of the state.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  Filter the `Treatments` collection for records where the `end_dt` falls within the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered treatments, we need to access the patient's insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) to use as a partitioning key. We'll create a temporary calculated field for this.

**Explanation:**

1.  `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type`: This line starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)` filters these treatments to include only those that ended in the year 2022.
    *   `.CALCULATE(derived_ins_type = patient.ins_type)` creates a new temporary field `derived_ins_type` for each treatment, which holds the insurance type of the patient associated with that treatment. This field is necessary for partitioning in the next step.

2.  `partitioned_by_insurance`: This takes the previously prepared `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(derived_ins_type))` groups the treatments based on the `derived_ins_type`. Each group (partition) will contain all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.

3.  `insurance_type_metrics`: This operates on the `partitioned_by_insurance` data.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes aggregate values for each insurance type group:
        *   `insurance_type = derived_ins_type`:  This selects the insurance type (which was the partition key) for the output, renaming it to `insurance_type`.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: This calculates the average `day100_pasi_score`. The `AVG` function operates on all `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: This counts the number of unique patient IDs among the treatments in the current insurance type group.

4.  `top_5_insurance_types_by_pasi`: This takes the `insurance_type_metrics`.
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_d100.ASC())` sorts these aggregated results by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (lowest score first) and selects the top 5 records.

The approach is as follows:
1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  For each diagnosis, calculate:
    *   The diagnosis name (`diag_name`).
    *   The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score from its associated treatments and their outcome records. This is achieved using `MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`.
    *   The number of distinct patients treated for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`.
3.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The primary sorting criterion will be the maximum itch score in descending order. Diagnoses for which this score is not available (null) will be ranked last.
4.  Finally, select and rename the fields as requested: `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score`.

```python
result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate intermediate fields for each diagnosis
    diagnosis_name_val=diag_name,
    max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas),

    number_of_patients=num_distinct_patients_val,
    maximum_itch_score=max_itch_score_val
)
```
Explanation:
- The query starts by accessing the `Diagnoses` collection.
- In the first `CALCULATE` step, we compute three values for each diagnosis:
    - `diagnosis_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis, taken directly from the `diag_name` field.
    - `max_itch_score_val`: The highest `day100_itch_vas` score recorded across all outcome records associated with treatments for that particular diagnosis. This is found by navigating `treatments_for` (plural relationship to `Treatments`), then `outcome_records` (plural relationship from `Treatments` to `Outcomes`), and applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `day100_itch_vas` field.
    - `num_distinct_patients_val`: The count of unique patients who have received treatment for the diagnosis. This is determined by navigating `treatments_for`, then to the linked `patient` (singular relationship from `Treatments` to `Patients`), and using `NDISTINCT` on their `patient_id`.
- The `TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))` function then filters these results to keep only the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking is based on `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). The `na_pos='last'` argument ensures that any diagnoses without a `day100_itch_vas` score (resulting in a null `max_itch_score_val`) are placed at the end of the ranking and are less likely to be included in the top 3.
- Finally, the second `CALCULATE` step selects these three computed values and renames them to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested for the output.",46.71632218360901,"result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(

1.  Define a date variable, `var_start_date_limit`, representing the first day of the calendar month that was 6 months prior to the current month. This will be used to filter treatments.
2.  Create an intermediate collection `treatments_with_specialty_and_date_filter`. This starts with the `Treatments` collection, filters for treatments where `start_dt` is on or after `var_start_date_limit`, and calculates the `doctor.speciality` for each of these treatments, naming it `calculated_specialty`.
3.  Partition `treatments_with_specialty_and_date_filter` by `calculated_specialty`. This groups the filtered treatments by doctor specialty.
4.  For each specialty group in the partition, calculate:
    *   `output_specialty`: The name of the specialty (which is `calculated_specialty`).
    *   `output_num_treatments`: The count of treatments within this specialty group. This is achieved by `COUNT(Treatments)`, which counts the `Treatments` records that satisfy both the initial date filter and belong to the current specialty partition.
    *   `output_total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within this specialty group. This is achieved by `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`, which sums the `tot_drug_amt` from `Treatments` records satisfying the same conditions.
5.  From the resulting `specialty_aggregated_data`, select the top 3 specialties using `TOP_K(3, by=output_total_drug_amount.DESC())`.
6.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `specialty`, `number_of_treatments`, and `total_drug_amount`.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code addresses the request by performing the following steps:

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   It starts with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   For each drug, it calculates three new fields:
        *   `d_name`: Stores the `drug_name`.
        *   `n_treatments`: Counts the number of treatments associated with the drug using `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`. The `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection linking drugs to their treatments.
        *   `avg_d_amount`: Calculates the average total drug amount for all treatments associated with the drug using `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`. `tot_drug_amt` is a field in the `Treatments` collection. If a drug has no treatments, `COUNT` will be 0 and `AVG` will likely result in `NULL` (or be handled gracefully by the aggregation).

2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=n_treatments.DESC())`**:
    *   This function selects the top 5 drugs.
    *   The ranking is determined by the `n_treatments` field in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning drugs with the highest number of treatments will be ranked higher. The phrase ""by number of treatments and average drug amount"" is interpreted as primarily ranking by the number of treatments, as `TOP_K`'s `by` parameter typically takes a single primary sorting expression.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Finally, this selects and renames the fields for the output, as requested:
        *   `drug_name`: From the calculated `d_name`.
        *   `number_of_treatments`: From the calculated `n_treatments`.
        *   `average_drug_amount`: From the calculated `avg_d_amount`.

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"The user wants to count treatments based on three main criteria:
1.  The associated diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"" (case-insensitively, with wildcards).
2.  The drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (implying it's FDA-approved).
3.  The treatment's end date is within the last 6 months from the current date and the treatment has indeed ended.

We can achieve this by:
1.  Starting with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filtering these treatments using a `WHERE` clause that combines all conditions:
    *   For the diagnosis: `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`. We use `UPPER` to ensure case-insensitivity and `%` for wildcard matching.
    *   For FDA approval: `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`, which checks if the `fda_appr_dt` field (FDA approval date) exists for the drug associated with the treatment.
    *   For the end date:
        *   The treatment must have an end date: `HAS(end_dt) == 1`.
        *   The end date must be on or before today: `end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`.
        *   The end date must be on or after 6 months ago from today: `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`.
3.  Counting the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Filter treatments based on the specified criteria
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)

)

# Calculate the total count of such treatments
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters.
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`: This condition checks if the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with the treatment contains ""psoriasis"". `UPPER` is used on `diag_name` and the pattern is in uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching. The `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the `drug` used in the treatment has an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), implying it's FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months ago from the current time. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment `end_dt` is not in the future, meaning the treatment has indeed ended by today.
    *   All these conditions are combined with the logical `&` (AND) operator, so a treatment must satisfy all of them.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_treatments` contains all treatments meeting the criteria.

    *   Accessing their `prescribed_treatments`.
    *   Ranking these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `RANKING` function with `per=""Doctors""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each doctor.
    *   Selecting the treatment with rank 1.
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to ensure we are referencing a single treatment record, as `CALCULATE` expects singular values.
4.  In the final `CALCULATE` step, we select the doctor's `last_name` and `year_reg`. For the first treatment, we retrieve its `start_dt` and `treatment_id`.
5.  `DEFAULT_TO(..., None)` is used to gracefully handle cases where a doctor might not have any prescribed treatments, ensuring that `treatment_date` and `treatment_identifier` will be `None` in such scenarios.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE(is_placebo == True)` to select only placebo treatments.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each selected placebo treatment.

The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures that only medications started on or up to 14 days after the parent treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`) are included. `start_dt` here refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the parent placebo treatment.

    *   `concomitant_med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication (from its own `end_dt` field).

1.  Iterate through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll filter their `transactions_received` where the `status` is ""successful"".
3.  Calculate the ""number of distinct coupons used"":
    *   From the successful transactions, further filter those that actually used a coupon (i.e., `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
    *   Count the number of distinct coupon IDs (`coupon.cid`) from these transactions using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  Calculate the ""number of distinct transactions"":
    *   Count all successful transactions for the merchant using `COUNT`. Since each transaction record is typically unique, `COUNT` on the filtered successful transactions gives the number of distinct successful transactions.
5.  Calculate CPUR: Divide the ""number of distinct coupons used"" by the ""number of distinct successful transactions"".
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero. In such cases, CPUR will be 0.0.

        *   `.coupon.cid`: Accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the coupon used in each of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `num_distinct_successful_txns_val=COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were ""successful"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts these successful transactions.
    *   `cpur_val=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_txns_val > 0, ...)`: Checks if there were any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons_used_val / num_distinct_successful_txns_val`: If there were successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as defined.
        *   `0.0`: If there were no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.

2.  `result = merchant_cpur_data.CALCULATE(...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used on the result of the first one. This step is primarily for selecting and renaming the final fields as requested.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter Users**: It starts by selecting `Users` whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""CA"".
2.  **Enhance Notifications Data**: For the `notifications` of these selected users, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start`: The starting date of the week in which the notification was `created_at`. This is achieved by truncating `created_at` to the 'start of week'.
    *   `is_weekend`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the notification was created on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", and `False` otherwise.
3.  **Filter for Past Weeks**: It then filters these enhanced notifications to include only those where `notification_week_start` is before the start of the current week. This ensures we only consider notifications from past full weeks.
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered past notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by `notification_week_start`. This creates groups of notifications for each past week.
5.  **Aggregate Weekly Stats**: For each weekly group, it calculates:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (the partition key).
    *   `total_notifications`: The total count of notifications within that week's group.
    *   `weekend_notifications`: The count of notifications that occurred on a weekend within that week's group. This is done by summing the `is_weekend` boolean flag (where True is treated as 1 and False as 0).
6.  **Select Last 3 Weeks**: Finally, it uses `TOP_K(3, by=week_start_date.DESC())` to select the three most recent weeks from these aggregated weekly statistics.

1.  **Filter User Balances**: We first select records from the `UserBalances` collection that have been updated within the last 7 days. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to compare the `updated_at` timestamp with the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: According to the definition, ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". For each user whose balance was updated in the specified period, we calculate their average balance from these updated records. This is done by partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id` and then applying the `AVG()` function to the `balance` field within each user's group. This gives the AMB for each user.
3.  **Calculate the Overall Average AMB**: Finally, we calculate the average of all the per-user AMBs computed in the previous step. This will give the single ""average balance"" value requested.

The query assumes that `UserBalances` might contain multiple balance entries (snapshots) for a single user within the 7-day period. If a user's balance was updated multiple times, their AMB will be the average of those recorded balances. If `UserBalances` only stores the single most current balance per user, this approach is still valid; the AMB per user would simply be their latest balance if it was updated in the past week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_user_balances`: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection. It keeps only those records where the `updated_at` timestamp is within the last 7 days, inclusive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between `updated_at` and the current moment.
2.  `user_amb_values`: This part takes the `recent_user_balances` and groups them by `user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each user), it calculates `amb_for_this_user` as the average of their `balance` values found in the `recent_user_balances`. This aligns with the definition of AMB as the average balance per user for the specified time duration.
3.  `result`: This final step computes a single global value. It takes all the `amb_for_this_user` values calculated in the previous step and computes their average using `AVG()`.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each user.
    *   `user_uid=uid`: Selects the user's unique identifier (`uid`).
    *   `user_username=username`: Selects the user's `username`.
    *   `latest_balance_amount=...`: This expression calculates the Latest User Balance (LUB).
        *   `Users.balances`: For the current user, this accesses their list of balance records (from the `UserBalances` collection).
        *   `.TOP_K(1, by=updated_at.DESC())`: This function is applied to the user's balances. It sorts these balances by the `updated_at` field in descending order (most recent first) and selects the top 1 record. This effectively isolates the most recent balance record for the user.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `TOP_K` returns a collection (even if it's a single-item collection), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record context. If the user has no balances, `TOP_K` would return an empty collection, and `SINGULAR()` on an empty collection is assumed to result in a context where subsequent field access yields null.
        *   `.balance`: From the singular, most recent balance record, this accesses the actual `balance` amount.
        *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., None)`: This function ensures that if a user has no balance records (making the preceding expression evaluate to null), the `latest_balance_amount` will be `None` instead of causing an error. This provides a graceful way to handle users without any balance history.

The final `result` will be a collection of records, where each record contains the `user_uid`, `user_username`, and their `latest_balance_amount` (LUB).",45.83912682533264,"result = Users.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, access their `setting_snapshots`.
3.  Within these snapshots, identify the latest one by ranking them based on `snapshot_date` in descending order. The `RANKING` function with `per=""Users""` ensures this ranking is performed independently for each user's set of snapshots. We filter for the snapshot with rank 1.
4.  Use `.SINGULAR()` to convert the resulting single-item collection (the latest snapshot) into a singular record.
5.  From this singular latest snapshot record, extract the `marketing_opt_in` field.
6.  The final result will include the user's `uid` (as `user_id`) and their `marketing_opt_in` status. If a user has no setting snapshots, the `marketing_opt_in_status` will likely be null.

        *   `== 1`: Selects only the snapshot with rank 1 (the latest one).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the filtered result (which should be a collection containing just the single latest snapshot) into a singular record. This is necessary to access its fields directly.
    *   `.marketing_opt_in`: Accesses the `marketing_opt_in` boolean value from the latest snapshot record.

**Explanation:**

1.  `two_months_ago_start_date` and `current_month_start_date` are contextless expressions defining the time window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')` calculates the date for the start of the month that was two full months prior to the current month.
2.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified date range and were initiated by a sender of `sender_type = 0`.
3.  The first `CALCULATE` call on `relevant_transactions_for_pmdau` creates a new collection `transactions_with_month_info`. For each transaction, it adds `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` (extracted from `created_at`) and includes `sender_id` under the new name `sender_id_val`. This prepares the data for monthly aggregation.
4.  `PARTITION(name=""monthly_active_users_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))` groups the `transactions_with_month_info` data by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
5.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these monthly groups. It outputs `year_of_transaction` and `month_of_transaction` (which are the partitioning keys) and `pmdau`. The `pmdau` is calculated using `NDISTINCT(sender_id_val)`, which counts the unique sender IDs within each monthly group, fulfilling the PMDAU definition.
6.  Finally, `ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())` sorts the monthly PMDAU figures chronologically.",55.98465943336487,"# Define the date boundaries for the query:

1.  Start with the `Users` collection to process each user.
2.  For each user, calculate the sum of durations of their sessions that fall within the specified date range.
    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).
    *   Filter these sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01T00:00:00"" and before ""2023-06-08T00:00:00"".
    *   For each filtered session, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`.
    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).
5.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each user in the `Users` collection.
    *   `user_id_val = uid`: We store the user's unique identifier (`uid`) as `user_id_val`.
    *   `total_duration_val = SUM(...)`: For each user, we calculate the sum of session durations.
        *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the user's `sessions` (which are `UserSessions` records linked to this user) and filter them based on the `session_start_ts` to include only those within the range \[2023-06-01 00:00:00, 2023-06-08 00:00:00).
        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll calculate the start and end dates for the previous month based on the current date. The previous month starts on the first day of the month preceding the current month and ends on the last day of that same month (or, equivalently, just before the first day of the current month).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated ""previous month"" period using their `created_at` timestamp.
3.  **Identify Successful Transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`. This is a common convention, but if a different status indicates success, this condition should be adjusted.
4.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions that occurred in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (as defined above) within that same period.
5.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We'll ensure this is a floating-point division and handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).

We will use contextless expressions to define the date boundaries and the initial filtered set of transactions for clarity. The final result will be a single value representing the STR for the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `_prev_month_start_boundary`: This contextless expression calculates the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, this will be June 1st, 00:00:00.
2.  `_current_month_start_boundary`: This calculates the first moment of the current month (e.g., July 1st, 00:00:00). This serves as the exclusive upper bound for the ""previous month"" period.
3.  `_transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `_prev_month_start_boundary` and before `_current_month_start_boundary`.
4.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `_transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is `""completed""`.

6.  The final `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `previous_month_str = str_value`: This selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str` for the final output, ensuring the result contains just this single requested value.

    *   Count their associated `coupons` that satisfy the condition: the coupon's creation year and month must match the merchant's creation year and month. This count will be named `num_coupons`.
4.  Use `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons.DESC())` to select the single merchant with the highest count of such coupons.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following operations:
1.  It starts with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` call processes each merchant to:
    *   Store its `mid` as `merchant_id_temp`.
    *   Store its `name` as `merchant_name_temp`.
    *   Extract the `YEAR` from the merchant's `created_at` date and store it as `merchant_creation_year`.
    *   Extract the `MONTH` from the merchant's `created_at` date and store it as `merchant_creation_month`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` call builds upon the previous step for each merchant:
    *   It defines the output field `mid` using the stored `merchant_id_temp`.
    *   It defines the output field `name` using the stored `merchant_name_temp`.
    *   It calculates `num_coupons` by counting the `coupons` associated with the current merchant. The `WHERE` clause inside `COUNT` filters these coupons, including only those where the coupon's `created_at` year and month match the `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` (calculated in the previous step for the merchant).
4.  Finally, `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons.DESC())` selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons`, ordering in descending order. The result will contain the `mid`, `name`, and `num_coupons` for this top merchant.",37.84291648864746,"result = Merchants.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table. It selects transactions that:
    *   Occurred in 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   Were initiated by a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
    *   Were successful (`status == ""successful""`).
    *   Were sent by a user who is currently marked as active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
2.  `transactions_with_month_and_user_id`: This `CALCULATE` step processes the `filtered_transactions`. For each transaction, it:
    *   Derives `transaction_month_asat_date` by taking the `created_at` timestamp and truncating it to the start of its month (e.g., ""2023-01-15 10:00:00"" becomes ""2023-01-01 00:00:00""). This provides a consistent date value for each month.
    *   Extracts `sender_user_uid` which is the `uid` of the `sending_user`. This ID will be used for counting distinct users.
3.  `monthly_distinct_active_users`: This is the core aggregation step.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_sends"", by=(transaction_month_asat_date))` groups the records from `transactions_with_month_and_user_id` based on the `transaction_month_asat_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., each month).
        *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_asat_date`: Selects the month (which is the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(transactions_with_month_and_user_id.sender_user_uid)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_user_uid` values within that month's group. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the sessions into groups based on the `device_type`. Each unique `device_type` will form a group.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(device_type=device_type, session_count=COUNT(UserSessions))`**:
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `device_type`):
        *   We select the `device_type` itself.
        *   We calculate `session_count` by counting the number of `UserSessions` within that specific `device_type` group using `COUNT(UserSessions)`.

3.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=session_count.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, we take the result from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of device types and their session counts).
    *   We use `TOP_K(2, by=session_count.DESC())` to select the top 2 records, ordered by `session_count` in descending order (`DESC()`). This gives us the two device types with the highest session counts.

*   `UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_group"", by=(device_type))`: This part of the query takes the `UserSessions` collection and groups its records based on the unique values of the `device_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `device_group`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is then applied to each `device_group`.
    *   `device_type = device_type`: This selects the `device_type` for the current group, which is the key by which the partition was made.
    *   `avg_session_duration_in_seconds = AVG(DATEDIFF(""seconds"", UserSessions.session_start_ts, UserSessions.session_end_ts))`:
        *   `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", UserSessions.session_start_ts, UserSessions.session_end_ts)`: For each user session record (`UserSessions`) within the current `device_type` group, this expression calculates the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` in seconds, effectively giving the duration of that specific session.
        *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` function then takes all these individual session durations (calculated for sessions within the current `device_type` group) and computes their average. This results in the average session duration for that specific `device_type`.",51.66909837722778,"average_duration_by_device_type = UserSessions.PARTITION(

"Which merchants earliest coupon start date was within a year of the merchant's registration? Return the merchant _id, registration date, and earliest coupon _id and start date","WITH earliest_coupons AS (SELECT c.merchant_id, MIN(c.start_date) AS earliest_coupon_start_date FROM coupons AS c GROUP BY c.merchant_id) SELECT m.mid AS merchant_id, m.created_at AS merchant_registration_date, ec.earliest_coupon_start_date, c.cid AS earliest_coupon_id FROM merchants AS m JOIN earliest_coupons AS ec ON m.mid = ec.merchant_id JOIN coupons AS c ON ec.merchant_id = c.merchant_id AND ec.earliest_coupon_start_date = c.start_date WHERE ec.earliest_coupon_start_date <= date(m.created_at, '+1 year');",Ewallet,"The query aims to find merchants whose earliest coupon's start date falls within one year of their registration date.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  It filters out merchants who have no coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `m_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `m_registration_date`.
    *   The details of the earliest coupon for that merchant. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the merchant's `coupons` sub-collection.
        *   Applying a `WHERE` clause with `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), allow_ties=False) == 1`. This ranks the coupons by their `start_date` in ascending order (earliest first) within the context of the current merchant. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single coupon is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date.
        *   Using `.SINGULAR()` to convert the result (which should be a single coupon record) into a singular item accessible in `CALCULATE`. This is stored as `earliest_coupon_details`.
4.  After these calculations, another `WHERE` clause filters these merchants further:
    *   It checks if the `earliest_coupon_details.start_date` is on or after the `m_registration_date`.
    *   It also checks if the `earliest_coupon_details.start_date` is on or before one year from the `m_registration_date`. The `DATETIME(m_registration_date, '+1 year')` function is used to accurately calculate the date one year after registration.
5.  Finally, a `CALCULATE` clause selects and renames the fields for the output:
    *   `merchant_id` (from `m_id`)
    *   `registration_date` (from `m_registration_date`)
    *   `earliest_coupon_id` (from `earliest_coupon_details.cid`)
    *   `earliest_coupon_start_date` (from `earliest_coupon_details.start_date`)

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we need to check their `notifications` sub-collection.
3.  We are interested in notifications that occurred within 365 days of the user's signup date (`Users.created_at`). We can filter these ""early"" notifications using `notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365)`.
    *   In this `DATEDIFF` function, the first `created_at` (`Users.created_at`) refers to the signup date of the current user being processed.
    *   The second `created_at` refers to the `created_at` field of the `notifications`.
4.  A user should be selected if they have no such ""early"" notifications. This is checked using `HASNOT(...) == 1` on the filtered notifications collection. This condition correctly includes users with no notifications at all, as well as users whose notifications all occurred after their first year.
5.  Finally, for the selected users, we use `CALCULATE` to return their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date aliased as `signup_date`.

```python
users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
    HASNOT(
        notifications.WHERE(
            DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365

This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  It starts with the `Users` collection.
2.  It filters these users using the `WHERE` clause. The condition `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365)) == 1` checks for users who do not have any notifications within the first 365 days of their signup.
    *   `Users.created_at` refers to the creation date of the user (signup date).
    *   The inner `created_at` refers to the creation date of a notification.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365` identifies notifications that occurred on or before the 365th day after the user signed up.
    *   `HASNOT(...) == 1` ensures that users are selected if the collection of such ""early"" notifications is empty. This covers users with no notifications at all, or users whose notifications all fall outside this first-year window.
3.  For the users who meet this criterion, the `CALCULATE` function selects their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` field (which is their signup date), renaming it to `signup_date` in the output.",27.312557458877563,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
