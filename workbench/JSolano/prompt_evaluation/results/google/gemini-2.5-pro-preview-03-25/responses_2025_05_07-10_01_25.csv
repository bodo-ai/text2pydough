1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate their `name`, the `total_transactions_count` (total number of transactions they've made), and the `successful_transactions_count`. We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` field in the `Transactions` collection is ""Completed"".
3.  Filter these customers to include only those where `total_transactions_count` is 5 or more.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate the `success_rate` as `(successful_transactions_count * 100.0) / total_transactions_count`.
5.  Select the `customer_name` and the calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Order the final result by `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer
customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    total_transactions_count=COUNT(transactions_made),
    successful_transactions_count=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))
)

# Filter for customers with at least 5 transactions
customers_with_min_transactions = customer_transaction_summary.WHERE(total_transactions_count >= 5)

# Calculate success rate and select the required fields, then order

    customer_name=customer_name,
    success_rate=(successful_transactions_count * 100.0) / total_transactions_count
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `total_transactions_count=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts all transactions associated with each customer using the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `successful_transactions_count=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts transactions associated with each customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This assumes ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction.

2.  `customers_with_min_transactions = customer_transaction_summary.WHERE(total_transactions_count >= 5)`:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` to include only customers who have made 5 or more total transactions.

3.  `customer_success_rates = customers_with_min_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `customer_name=customer_name`: Selects the customer's name again for the final output.
    *   `success_rate=(successful_transactions_count * 100.0) / total_transactions_count`: Calculates the success rate as a percentage. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point division. Division by `total_transactions_count` is safe here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures it's at least 5.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`: Sorts the final list of customers by their success rate in ascending order (lowest success rate first).

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols. This will be used as a contextless expression.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG tickers. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in combination with `WHERE` and `ISIN` on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
4.  Finally, count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will be inherently distinct because we are filtering and then counting records from the `Customers` collection. The result will be a single value, so we'll use `Broker.CALCULATE`.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is used as a contextless expression for clarity and reusability.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This condition checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with "".com"".
    *   `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two conditions.
    *   `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1)`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction related to a FAANG stock.
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` list. `ISIN` checks for membership in the provided tuple.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the result of the inner filtering (transactions in FAANG stocks) is not empty, meaning the customer has at least one such transaction.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_distinct_faang_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want a single aggregated value from the `Broker` (high-level graph) context.
    *   `count_distinct_faang_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers)`: This counts the number of customers in the `filtered_customers` collection.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`active_customers_since_2023 = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an `&` (AND):
        *   `join_date >= ""2023-01-01""`: Selects customers whose `join_date` is on or after January 1, 2023.
        *   `status == ""Active""`: Selects customers whose `status` is 'Active'.
    *   The result is a collection of customers who meet both criteria.

2.  **`tac_by_country = active_customers_since_2023.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `active_customers_since_2023` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country))`: This groups the filtered customers by their `country`. Each group (partition) will contain customers from the same country.
    *   `.CALCULATE(country_name=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`: For each country group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `country_name=country`: Selects the `country` field for the output, renaming it to `country_name`.
        *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers within the current country group. This gives the ""Total Active Customers"" (TAC) for that specific country.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the start of the current week and the start of the 8th week prior to the current week. This defines our 8-week window.
    *   `start_of_this_week`: The first day of the current week.
    *   `start_of_the_8th_week_prior`: The first day of the week that was exactly 8 weeks before the current week.
2.  **Process Transactions**:
    *   Filter transactions to include only those related to 'Stock' tickers using `Transactions.WHERE(ticker.ticker_type == 'Stock')`.
    *   For each of these transactions, calculate:
        *   `week_start_dt`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This is done using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
        *   `is_weekend`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday. This is determined using `ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
3.  **Filter for Relevant Weeks**: We then filter these processed transactions to include only those whose `week_start_dt` falls within our 8-week window (i.e., on or after `start_of_the_8th_week_prior` and before `start_of_this_week`).
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered transactions are partitioned by their `week_start_dt`. This groups all transactions that occurred in the same week.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts**: For each weekly group:
    *   `week_start_date_output`: The start date of the week (from the partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: The total number of stock transactions in that week, calculated using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: The number of stock transactions that occurred on a weekend in that week. This is calculated by `SUM(Transactions.is_weekend)`, summing the boolean `is_weekend` flag (where true is 1 and false is 0).
6.  **Order and Finalize**: The results are ordered by the week start date in ascending order. Finally, columns are named descriptively for the output.

Since new fields defined in a `CALCULATE` are not immediately available in the same `CALCULATE` for functions like `RANKING` that operate on them, we use a second `CALCULATE` statement.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate customer name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount for each customer.
customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)
)

# Step 2: Add the customer rank (CR) based on the total transaction amount.
# CR is defined as the rank by total transaction amount, with rank 1 being the highest.
result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=customer_name,
    num_transactions=num_transactions,
    total_trans_amount=total_trans_amount,
    CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to derive new fields or select existing ones.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` field and renames it to `customer_name`.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Calculates the total number of transactions for each customer by counting records in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field from all transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.

2.  `result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary`.
    *   It uses another `CALCULATE` to include the previously calculated fields and add the new `CR` field.
    *   `customer_name=customer_name`, `num_transactions=num_transactions`, `total_trans_amount=total_trans_amount`: These lines ensure the fields calculated in the previous step are carried forward to the final result.
    *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: This calculates the rank for each customer.
        *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank to each row within its partition (or globally if no partition is specified).
        *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` field, in descending order (so the customer with the highest amount gets rank 1). Since no `per` argument is provided, the ranking is performed across all customers in the `customer_transaction_summary` collection.",24.27090811729431,"# Step 1: Calculate customer name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount for each customer.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with `transaction_type` equal to ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred within the last 10 days. We interpret ""past 10 days"" as a 10-day window including today (i.e., transactions from today up to 9 days ago). This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 9`.
3.  For these filtered transactions, we extract the `symbol` from the related `ticker` object and name it `ticker_s`.
4.  We then `PARTITION` these transactions by the extracted `ticker_s`.
5.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we `CALCULATE` the `ticker_symbol` (which is `ticker_s`) and count the number of transactions, naming this count `num_buy_transactions`.
6.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions.

The final result will contain the `ticker_symbol` and `num_buy_transactions` for these top 2 tickers.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first determine the start and end dates for our 6-month period.
    *   The period ends at the beginning of the current month. This can be calculated as `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   The period starts 6 months before that. This can be calculated as `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`.
    These will be calculated at the `Broker` level.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window.

3.  **Extract Signup Month**: For each selected customer, we extract a 'YYYY-MM' formatted string for their signup month from their `join_date`. This will be used for grouping. The `LPAD` function is used to ensure the month is two digits (e.g., '01' for January).

4.  **Partition by Signup Month**: We group the filtered customers by their `signup_month_str`.

5.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each signup month group:
    *   **PMCS**: Count the number of customers in that group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   **PMAT**: Calculate the average transaction `amount` from all transactions made by customers in that group. This is done using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`.

6.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by the signup month in ascending order for better readability.

```python
customer_monthly_metrics = Broker.CALCULATE(
    # Define the start and end of the 6-month period, excluding the current month
    start_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months'),
    end_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')

    PMAT = AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)
).ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Broker` level to define `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` gives the first day of the month that was 6 months ago. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the first day of the current month.
2.  `.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them based on their `join_date` being within the calculated `start_period_date` (inclusive) and `end_period_date` (exclusive).
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month_str=...)`: For the filtered customers, we create a new field `signup_month_str` by combining the year and month of their `join_date` (e.g., ""2023-06""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""signup_monthly_group"", by=(signup_month_str))`: We partition these customers into groups based on their `signup_month_str`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month=..., PMCS=..., PMAT=...)`: For each group (i.e., for each signup month):
    *   `signup_month = signup_month_str`: We select the signup month.
    *   `PMCS = COUNT(Customers)`: We count the number of customers in the current partition (i.e., customers who signed up in this specific month).
    *   `PMAT = AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the average transaction `amount` across all transactions made by the customers who signed up in this specific month.

    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made any transactions, False otherwise.
    *   `is_active_and_has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer's status is 'active' AND they have made any transactions, False otherwise.
3.  **Group by Country**: Partition the processed customer data by their country.
4.  **Calculate AR per Country**: For each country:
    *   Count the `Number of Active Customers with Transactions` by summing the `is_active_and_has_transactions_flag`.
    *   Count the `Total Number of Customers with Transactions` by summing the `has_transactions_flag`.
    *   Calculate AR using the formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100.0`.
    *   Handle cases where the `Total Number of Customers with Transactions` is zero to avoid division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
5.  **Format Output**: Present the results with columns for `country` and `AR`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_info`:
    *   Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is in the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`.
    *   `CALCULATE` then creates new fields for each of these customers:
        *   `country_field`: Stores the customer's country, which will be used for grouping.
        *   `has_transactions_flag`: A boolean (True/1 or False/0) indicating if the customer has any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
        *   `is_active_and_has_transactions_flag`: A boolean indicating if the customer's `status` is ""active"" AND they have transactions.

2.  `activity_ratio_by_country`:
    *   Takes `customers_joined_2022_info` and partitions it by `country_field` using `PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country_field))`. This groups the customers by country.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each country group:
        *   `output_country`: The country name for the current group.
        *   `num_active_cust_with_trans`: Calculates the sum of `is_active_and_has_transactions_flag` for all customers in the current country group. This sum represents the ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"".
        *   `total_cust_with_trans`: Calculates the sum of `has_transactions_flag` for all customers in the current country group. This sum represents the ""Total Number of Customers with Transactions"".
        *   `activity_ratio_value`: Computes the AR. It uses `IFF` to check if `total_cust_with_trans` is greater than 0. If it is, AR is calculated as `(num_active_cust_with_trans * 100.0) / total_cust_with_trans`. Otherwise (if `total_cust_with_trans` is 0, to prevent division by zero), AR is set to `0.0`.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to `country` and `AR` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause is used to filter customers based on specific criteria.

2.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**:
    *   This part of the condition checks the customer's name.
    *   `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's name to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two name conditions, so a customer is selected if their name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.

3.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**:
    *   This condition checks the customer's state.
    *   `LOWER(state)`: Converts the state to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`: Checks if the lowercase state ends with the letter 'a'.

4.  **`&`**:
    *   The AND operator combines the name condition and the state condition. A customer must satisfy both sets of criteria to be included in `filtered_customers`.

5.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(number_of_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Broker` collection to perform a final calculation.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: Counts the number of customers that met all the specified conditions in the `filtered_customers` collection.

1.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select transactions that are of type ""sell"" and occurred within the last month, inclusive of one month ago up to the current moment. The date range will be from `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` to `DATETIME('now')`.
2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: The filtered transactions will be grouped by their associated ticker symbol using `PARTITION`. The `ticker.symbol` field will be used as the partitioning key.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each ticker group, we need to calculate:
    *   `Total Amount from Sells`: This is the sum of the `amount` for all sell transactions in the group.
    *   `Total Tax + Commission`: This is the sum of (`tax` + `commission`) for all sell transactions in the group. To sum an expression involving multiple fields from the sub-collection, we'll use an inner `CALCULATE` as per PyDough guidelines: `SUM(Transactions.CALCULATE(combined_cost = tax + commission).combined_cost)`.
4.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values, SPM is calculated with the formula: `(Total Amount from Sells - (Total Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`. We'll use `IFF` to handle cases where `Total Amount from Sells` is zero to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` in such cases.
5.  **Select Output Fields**: The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `spm`.

    )

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `relevant_transactions`: This variable stores transactions that are of type ""sell"" and have a `date_time` falling between one month ago (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`) and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`), inclusive.
2.  `ticker_aggregates`:
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_transactions` by `ticker.symbol`. This groups all relevant sell transactions for each unique ticker symbol. The partition group is named `sells_by_ticker`.
    *   In the subsequent `CALCULATE`, for each ticker group:
        *   `ticker_symbol_value = ticker.symbol`: The ticker symbol (which is the partition key) is selected.
        *   `total_sell_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within that ticker's group.
        *   `total_costs = SUM(Transactions.CALCULATE(combined_tax_commission = tax + commission).combined_tax_commission)`: Calculates the sum of `tax` plus `commission` for all transactions in the group. An inner `CALCULATE` is used to create the `combined_tax_commission` expression before summing, adhering to PyDough syntax for summing expressions involving multiple fields.
3.  `result`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the `ticker_aggregates` (which has one row per ticker with its total sales amount and total costs).
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_value`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `spm = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM).
        *   It checks if `total_sell_amount` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   Otherwise, SPM is calculated using the provided formula: `(total_sell_amount - total_costs) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`. The `100.0` ensures the result is a floating-point percentage.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Augment the `DailyPrices` collection by calculating the ticker symbol (`tick_symbol_calc`), year (`year_calc`), and month (`month_calc`) for each record. We also alias the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices to avoid naming conflicts and for clarity in aggregations.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol, year, and month. For each group, calculate the average closing price (`avg_close_price_agg`), maximum high price (`max_high_price_agg`), and minimum low price (`min_low_price_agg`). This results in a collection (`monthly_aggregated_stats`) where each row represents a unique ticker-month with its aggregated price data.
3.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: Partition the `monthly_aggregated_stats` by ticker symbol (`ticker_s_agg`). Within each ticker's group of monthly stats, use the `PREV` window function to find the average closing price of the previous month (`prev_month_avg_close_calc`). This is ordered by year and month to ensure correctness. The `per=""PerTickerGroup""` argument ensures `PREV` resets for each ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC and Format Output**: Using the results from the previous step, calculate the MoMC. Format the month as ""YYYY-MM"". Select the final required fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by ticker symbol and then by month.

The query first filters the `DailyPrices` to the records between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023 (inclusive). It calculates `stock_symbol` from the related `ticker` and aliases `high` and `low` prices.
Then, it partitions these filtered records by `stock_symbol`. For each distinct stock, it calculates `period_max_high` (the highest high price observed for that stock within the date range) and `period_min_low` (the lowest low price observed for that stock within the date range).
After that, it computes `price_difference` as the difference between `period_max_high` and `period_min_low` for each stock.
Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=price_difference.DESC())` selects the 3 stocks with the largest `price_difference`, ordered from highest to lowest change, and returns their `stock_symbol` and `price_difference`.",48.43918061256409,"# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the date range and get necessary fields including ticker symbol

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by iterating over the `Customers` collection.
    *   `temp_customer_id=_id` and `temp_customer_name=name`: We select the customer's `_id` and `name`, storing them in temporary variables to be used in the final output.
    *   `num_transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same month and year as their `join_date`.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions whose month and year match the customer's `join_date` month and year are considered. `date_time` refers to the transaction's timestamp, and `join_date` refers to the customer's sign-up date.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions that satisfy the condition.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the collection produced by the previous `CALCULATE` step (which includes each customer and their count of transactions in their join month).
    *   It selects the top 1 customer based on `num_transactions_in_join_month` in descending order, effectively finding the customer with the highest count.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=temp_customer_id, name=temp_customer_name, number_of_transactions=num_transactions_in_join_month)`:
    *   This final step takes the single customer record selected by `TOP_K`.
    *   It renames `temp_customer_id` to `_id`, `temp_customer_name` to `name`, and `num_transactions_in_join_month` to `number_of_transactions` to match the requested output format.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(cust_state=customer.state, tick_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, we navigate to its related `customer` to get the `state` (aliased as `cust_state`) and to its related `ticker` to get the `ticker_type` (aliased as `tick_type`).

2.  `state_ticker_combinations = transaction_details.PARTITION(name=""state_type_group"", by=(cust_state, tick_type)).CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`:

    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_type_group"", by=(cust_state, tick_type))` groups these records by unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these groups:
        *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `ticker_type=tick_type`: Selects the ticker type for the group.

-   The second condition `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` selects records from the last 7 days. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date/time, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days between the record's `date` and now.
-   The filtered records are stored in `vti_prices_last_7_days`.
-   Finally, `Broker.CALCULATE` is used to compute a single aggregated value: `MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`, which finds the minimum closing price among the selected daily prices.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We'll establish the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week period preceding it.
    *   `current_week_start_date_val`: The first day of the current calendar week.
    *   `eight_weeks_ago_start_date_val`: The first day of the calendar week that was 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week.
    The period of interest for payments will be from `eight_weeks_ago_start_date_val` (inclusive) to `current_week_start_date_val` (exclusive).

2.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales records where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000.

3.  **Filter Payments**: From these high-value sales, access their associated payments (`payment` sub-collection). Filter these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the defined 8-week period.

4.  **Augment Payment Data**: For each filtered payment, calculate:
    *   `payment_week_start_dt`: The start date of the calendar week in which the payment occurred. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_payment_flag`: A boolean flag indicating if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday.

5.  **Group and Aggregate Payments**:
    *   Partition the augmented payment data by `payment_week_start_dt`.
    *   For each week (each partition group), calculate:
        *   `week_output_date`: The start date of the week (from the partition key).

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to include only cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. The matching for the VIN number should be case-insensitive and allow partial matches. This can be achieved using `LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`.
2.  Group these filtered cars by their `make` and `model`. This is done using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each car make and model combination), count the total number of sales records associated with the cars in that group. The `sale_records` sub-collection on `Cars` provides this information, and `COUNT(Cars.sale_records)` will aggregate this count per group.
4.  The final result should include the `make`, `model`, and the calculated `number_of_sales`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Cars.WHERE(LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%'))`: This line filters the `Cars` collection.
    *   `UPPER(vin_number)` converts the `vin_number` field to uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%M5%')` checks if the uppercase `vin_number` contains the substring ""M5"". The `%` wildcards allow ""M5"" to appear anywhere in the VIN.
    *   The result, `cars_with_m5_in_vin`, is a collection of cars that meet this VIN criterion.

2.  `cars_with_m5_in_vin.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))`: This line takes the filtered cars and partitions them into groups based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`.
    *   `name=""car_model_group""` assigns a name to these partitioned groups, which isn't strictly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` in this specific query but is good practice.
    *   `by=(make, model)` specifies that the grouping should be done using the `make` and `model` fields of the cars.

3.  `.CALCULATE(make=make, model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`: This line is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `make=make`: Selects the `make` for the group.
    *   `model=model`: Selects the `model` for the group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for all cars within the current (make, model) group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` sub-collection of the `Cars` items within the partition group, and `COUNT` aggregates these across all cars in that group.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the associated car's `make` is ""Toyota"".
2.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 29` for this. `DATEDIFF` calculates the number of full day boundaries crossed. If a sale occurred today, the difference is 0. If it occurred 29 days ago, the difference is 29. Thus, `<= 29` covers a 30-day period including today.
3.  Use the `Dealership` (high-level graph) collection to calculate the final aggregated results:

1.  **Augment Sales Data**: Start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, retrieve the make and model of the car involved. Also, determine the car's latest inventory status. A car's status is found by looking at its `inventory_snapshots`. We take the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date`. If the car has snapshots, its status is `is_in_inventory` from that latest snapshot. If it has no snapshots, we'll consider its status as ""in inventory"" (True) by default, so it won't meet the ""no longer in inventory"" criterion.
2.  **Filter Sales**: Keep only those sales where the car's latest inventory status is `False` (meaning it's no longer in inventory).
3.  **Group and Aggregate**: Group these filtered sales by the car's make (`car_m`) and model (`car_mdl`). For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price`.
4.  **Order Results**: Finally, order these groups by the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order.

1.  Access the `Cars` collection.
2.  Filter these cars using a `WHERE` clause. The condition will check if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. We use the `LIKE` operator with '%' wildcards for partial matching and `LOWER` for case-insensitivity.
3.  For the filtered cars, use the `CALCULATE` method to:
    *   Select the `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `vin_number`.

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This starts by selecting from the `Cars` collection and then filters the records based on the specified condition.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""Gafford"", ""Fordson""). `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains ""mustang"".
*   `|`: This is the OR operator, combining the two conditions so that cars matching either condition are included.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this function is used to define the output fields.
*   `car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year, car_color=color, car_vin_number=vin_number`: These expressions select the respective car details and assign them to new field names for the output.
*   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales associated with each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. The `AVG` function computes the average of these sale prices for each car. If a car has no sale records, `AVG` will typically return `null`.",19.26189374923706,"result = Cars.WHERE(

1.  **Define Date Range**: Calculate the start and end dates for the 6-month period. The period ends just before the start of the current month and extends back 6 full months.
2.  **Identify Relevant Sales**: Filter sales made by salespersons hired between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023. For each of these sales, we'll note its sale price and truncate its date to the start of the month (`sale_month_key`).
3.  **Establish Report Months**: To ensure all months within the 6-month window are considered (even if specific salespersons had no activity), we create a base list of unique months. This list is derived from *all* sales in the `Sales` table that fall within our target 6-month window. Each such month will form a row in our final report.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each month in our base list (`unique_report_months_base`):
    *   **PMSPS**: Count the number of sales from our `relevant_salesperson_sales` where the `sale_month_key` matches the current report month.
    *   **PMSR**: Sum the `price_of_this_sale` from `relevant_salesperson_sales` where the `sale_month_key` matches the current report month.
    If there are no sales from the relevant salespersons in a particular report month, PMSPS and PMSR will correctly be 0 for that month.
5.  **Order Results**: The final data will be ordered by month in ascending order.

This approach ensures that if a month within the target window had any sales activity (from any salesperson), it will be included in the report. If the selected group of salespersons had no sales in such a month, their metrics for that month will be zero. Months with no sales activity at all from anyone in the dealership will not appear.

**Explanation:**

*   `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, which is appropriate for generating a single, global aggregate value.
*   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
*   `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(day_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment, `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of days between the `sale_date` (from the linked sale record) and the `payment_date` of the current payment.
    *   The result of this difference is assigned to a temporary field named `day_difference`.
    *   This inner `CALCULATE` effectively produces a collection of these `day_difference` values, one for each payment.
*   `.day_difference`: This accesses the `day_difference` values generated by the inner `CALCULATE` to be used by the `AVG` function.
*   `ROUND(..., 2)`: The final average calculated by `AVG` is rounded to 2 decimal places.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow these steps:
1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for each sale.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of the `cost` of each car sold, accessed via `Sales.car.cost`.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
5.  Handle the case where total cost might be zero to prevent division by zero errors. If total cost is zero, GPM will be considered 0.0.

The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` (graph) level to get a single GPM value for all relevant sales.

```python
gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales that occurred in the year 2023
    total_revenue_val = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of cars for sales that occurred in the year 2023
    total_cost_val = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Calculate Gross Profit Margin (GPM)
    # GPM = (Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Cost * 100
    # If total_cost_val is 0, GPM is set to 0.0 to avoid division by zero.
    gpm = IFF(total_cost_val != 0, (total_revenue_val - total_cost_val) / total_cost_val * 100.0, 0.0)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Dealership` level because we want a single aggregated GPM value.
2.  `total_revenue_val = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters all sales to get only those made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price` accesses the sale price for each of these filtered sales.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these sale prices to get the total revenue for 2023.
3.  `total_cost_val = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   Similarly, this filters sales for 2023.
    *   `.car.cost` accesses the cost of the car associated with each sale.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these costs to get the total cost of goods sold in 2023.
4.  The second `.CALCULATE(gpm = ...)` uses the `total_revenue_val` and `total_cost_val` calculated in the previous step.
5.  `gpm = IFF(total_cost_val != 0, (total_revenue_val - total_cost_val) / total_cost_val * 100.0, 0.0)`:
    *   This implements the GPM formula: `(revenue - cost) / cost`.
    *   `* 100.0` converts the ratio to a percentage and ensures floating-point arithmetic.
    *   `IFF(total_cost_val != 0, ..., 0.0)` checks if `total_cost_val` is not zero before performing the division. If `total_cost_val` is zero, GPM is set to `0.0` to prevent a division-by-zero error.

The final result, `gpm_for_2023_sales`, will be a collection with a single row and a single column `gpm`, representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",33.66925287246704,"gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the car associated with the sale has an inventory snapshot indicating it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the exact same day as the `sale_date`. We can use `HAS` to check for the existence of such an inventory snapshot for the car linked to the sale.
3.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` of the car (from `Sales.car`) and the `sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting all records from the `Sales` collection. It then filters them based on a condition.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This checks if, for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `(snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False)`: This is the inner filter for `inventory_snapshots`. It selects snapshots where:
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: The date of the inventory snapshot is the same as the sale date of the current sale record.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: The car was marked as not being in inventory (i.e., it went out).
2.  `top_priced_sale = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: From the sales that met the above criteria, this line selects the single sale (`TOP_K(1, ...)`) that has the highest `sale_price`. The `.DESC()` ensures descending order, so the top one is the highest.
3.  `result = top_priced_sale.CALCULATE(...)`: For the selected top sale, this line extracts the required information:
    *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.
    *   `model=car.model`: Retrieves the `model` of the car.

1.  Extract the year and month from the `payment_date` in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  Group the data by these extracted year and month values using `PARTITION`.
3.  For each month, calculate the sum of `payment_amount` to get the `total_monthly_payments`.
4.  Then, calculate the MoM change using the `PREV` window function. The MoM change is defined as `(current month value - prev month value)`. For the first month in the dataset, the previous month's value will be considered 0.
5.  The final result will be ordered by year and month.

The phrase ""Return all months in your answer, including those where there were no payments"" is interpreted as follows: all months that have records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection will be included. If a month has records but the sum of payments is zero, it will be shown with zero total payments. Months with absolutely no records in `PaymentsReceived` will not appear in the result, as `PARTITION` only creates groups for existing data.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `payments_with_year_month`: We first process the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, we extract the `payment_year_val` and `payment_month_val` from `payment_date` and retain the `payment_amount`.
2.  `monthly_payment_totals`: This step takes the augmented payment data and partitions it by `payment_year_val` and `payment_month_val`. For each unique year-month combination, it calculates:
    *   `year_num`: The year of the payment.
    *   `month_num`: The month of the payment.
    *   `total_monthly_payments_val`: The sum of all `payment_amount` for that specific month, accessed via `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)` which correctly refers to the payments within each partition group.
3.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` step operates on the `monthly_payment_totals`.
    *   It selects `payment_year` (from `year_num`), `payment_month` (from `month_num`), and `total_payments` (from `total_monthly_payments_val`).
    *   It computes `mom_change` as the difference between the current month's `total_monthly_payments_val` and the previous month's `total_monthly_payments_val`. The `PREV` function is used here:
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_payments_val, ...)`: Accesses the `total_monthly_payments_val` of the preceding row.
        *   `by=(year_num.ASC(), month_num.ASC())`: Ensures that ""preceding row"" is determined by chronological order of year and month.
        *   `default=0.0`: For the very first month in the dataset (where there's no preceding month), `PREV` returns `0.0`, so the MoM change will be equal to the total payments of that first month.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6` will include sales from today (0 days diff) up to 6 days ago (6 days diff), covering a total of 7 days.

Here's the PyDough code to find cars with no sales records and return their ID, make, model, and year.

The term ""left join"" in SQL is analogous to checking for the absence of related records in PyDough. We can achieve this by filtering the `Cars` collection for entries that do not have any associated `sale_records`.

```python
cars_with_no_sales = Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1).CALCULATE(
    car_id=_id,
    car_make=make,
    car_model=model,
    car_year=year

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**:
    *   We start with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to `Sales`) is empty for each car. `== 1` means we are looking for cars where this condition is true (i.e., they have no sales records).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**:
    *   After filtering, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the desired fields for the output.
    *   `car_id=_id`: Selects the `_id` field from the `Cars` collection and renames it to `car_id`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` field and renames it to `car_make`.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` field and renames it to `car_model`.

1. Access the `Customers` collection.
2. For each customer, check if they have any associated sales. The `car_purchases` sub-collection in `Customers` represents the sales made to that customer. We can use the `HAS()` function to check if this sub-collection is non-empty.
3. Filter the customers to include only those who have made at least one purchase.
4. From these filtered customers, select their `_id` (which is the customer ID).
The resulting list of IDs will be inherently distinct because `_id` is a unique identifier for each customer.

3. The `HAS` function is used to check for the existence of such sales and payments.

The PyDough code performs the following operations:

1.  It starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` computes two new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `num_sales_last_30_days`: This counts the sales from the `sales_made` sub-collection that occurred within the last 30 days. The `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30` condition filters these sales.
    *   `revenue_last_30_days`: This sums the `sale_price` of the same set of filtered recent sales.
    *   `first_name` and `last_name` are aliased to `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name` respectively, to be used later.
3.  The `WHERE(num_sales_last_30_days > 0)` clause filters the results to include only those salespersons who have made at least one sale in the specified period.
4.  `TOP_K(5, by=num_sales_last_30_days.DESC())` then selects the top 5 salespersons from the filtered list, based on the `num_sales_last_30_days` in descending order.
5.  The final `CALCULATE` selects the required information for these top 5 salespersons: their `first_name`, `last_name`, the calculated `total_sales_count` (which is `num_sales_last_30_days`), and `total_revenue_amount` (which is `revenue_last_30_days`).",50.177268505096436,"top_salespersons = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to create new fields:
    *   `car_make_field`: The make of the car associated with the sale (e.g., `Sales.car.make`).
    *   `car_model_field`: The model of the car associated with the sale (e.g., `Sales.car.model`).
    *   `sale_price_field`: The sale price of that specific sale.
    This prepares the data for grouping.

2.  `model_sales_summary = sales_details.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We take the `sales_details` collection and `PARTITION` it. The `name=""model_group""` assigns a name to the partition, and `by=(car_make_field, car_model_field)` specifies that we are grouping by the unique combinations of car make and model.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these groups:
        *   `actual_make=car_make_field` and `actual_model=car_model_field`: These bring the make and model (which are the partition keys) into the result for each group.
        *   `calculated_total_revenue=SUM(sales_details.sale_price_field)`: For each make/model group, this sums up the `sale_price_field` of all sales belonging to that group, giving the total revenue for that car model.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_last_3_months` and `end_date_today` are contextless expressions defining the 3-month period ending today.
2.  We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  The first `CALCULATE` operation:
    *   Renames `first_name` and `last_name` to `temp_first_name` and `temp_last_name` to carry them forward.
    *   Filters the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson to create `sales_in_period`, containing only sales that occurred between `start_date_last_3_months` and `end_date_today`.
4.  The second `CALCULATE` operation:
    *   Carries over the salesperson's names as `s_rep_first_name` and `s_rep_last_name`.
    *   Calculates `num_sales_in_period` by counting the sales in the `sales_in_period` list.
    *   Calculates `revenue_in_period` by summing the `sale_price` of sales in `sales_in_period`.
5.  The `WHERE(num_sales_in_period > 0)` clause filters out salespersons who had no sales during the specified period.
6.  `TOP_K(3, by=revenue_in_period.DESC())` selects the top 3 salespersons based on their `revenue_in_period`, with the highest revenue ranked first.
7.  The final `CALCULATE` formats the output to include only the requested fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_number_of_sales`, and `total_revenue`.",49.46417999267578,"# Define the start and end dates for the ""past 3 months"" period, inclusive of today.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  For each sale, calculate two key attributes:
    *   The state of the customer (`c_state`) associated with the sale.
    *   The first date of the quarter (`q_start_date`) in which the sale occurred. This is done by checking the month of the `sale_date` and mapping it to '2023-01-01' for Q1, '2023-04-01' for Q2, '2023-07-01' for Q3, or '2023-10-01' for Q4 using the `IFF` and `DATETIME` functions.
    *   Alias `sale_price` to `s_price` for aggregation.
3.  Partition the resulting records by `c_state` and `q_start_date`. This groups all sales by unique combinations of customer state and quarter.
4.  For each group, calculate the sum of `s_price` (which represents `sale_price`) to get the `total_quarterly_sales`.
5.  The final output will include `customer_state`, `quarter_first_date`, and `total_quarterly_sales`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_prepared = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then processes each of these filtered sales records to derive new attributes:
        *   `c_state = customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer who made the sale.
        *   `q_start_date = IFF(...)`: Calculates the first date of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions:
            *   If the month of `sale_date` is 1, 2, or 3, `q_start_date` is set to '2023-01-01'.
            *   Else, if the month is 4, 5, or 6, `q_start_date` is set to '2023-04-01'.
            *   Else, if the month is 7, 8, or 9, `q_start_date` is set to '2023-07-01'.
            *   Otherwise (for months 10, 11, 12), `q_start_date` is set to '2023-10-01'.
            *   The `DATETIME()` function is used to ensure these strings are treated as date objects.
        *   `s_price = sale_price`: Aliases the `sale_price` of the sale. This is the value that will be summed.

2.  `result = sales_prepared.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `sales_prepared` data (sales from 2023 with customer state and quarter start date).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`: Groups the records in `sales_prepared` based on unique combinations of `c_state` (customer state) and `q_start_date` (first date of the quarter). Each group is named `state_quarter_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, this calculates the final output fields:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: The customer's state for the group.
        *   `quarter_first_date = q_start_date`: The first date of the quarter for the group.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales = SUM(sales_prepared.s_price)`: Calculates the sum of `s_price` (which is `sale_price`) for all sales records within the current group (i.e., for that specific state and quarter). This gives the total sales for that quarter in that state.

**Explanation:**

*   We start with the `Drugs` collection.
*   For each drug, we use `CALCULATE` to create new fields:
    *   `drug_name_val`: This stores the `drug_name` of the current drug.

For example, if the current month is July, we'll look at April, May, and June. This window is defined from the start of the month 3 months ago up to (but not including) the start of the current month.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: Select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this 3-month window.
3.  **Extract Key Information**: For each selected treatment, we need:
    *   The `patient_id` to count distinct patients.
    *   A flag indicating if the treatment used a biologic drug (`drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`).
    *   A year-month key (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") derived from `start_dt` to group treatments by month.
4.  **Group by Month**: Partition the filtered treatments by the year-month key.
5.  **Calculate Counts per Month**: For each month's group:
    *   `month`: The year-month string.
    *   `patient_count`: The number of distinct `patient_id`s who received any treatment in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: The number of distinct `patient_id`s who received a biologic drug treatment in that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `treatments_in_relevant_period`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Treatments` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause selects treatments where `start_dt` is on or after the first day of the month three months prior to the current month, and before the first day of the current month. This effectively captures the last three full calendar months.
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered treatments:
        *   `patient_id_val = patient_id`: Stores the `patient_id`.
        *   `is_biologic_drug_treatment = (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')`: Creates a boolean flag that is true if the treatment's associated drug is of type 'biologic'.
        *   `treatment_year_month_key = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(start_dt), LPAD(MONTH(start_dt), 2, ""0""))`: Creates a string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2024-03"") for each treatment, which will be used for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.

2.  `result`:
    *   The `treatments_in_relevant_period` collection is then partitioned by `treatment_year_month_key`. This groups all treatments by the month in which they started.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these monthly groups:
        *   `month = treatment_year_month_key`: Outputs the year-month key for the group.
        *   `patient_count = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_val)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id_val` values within the current month's group. This gives the total number of distinct patients who received any treatment in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_count = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(Treatments.patient_id_val, Treatments.is_biologic_drug_treatment))`: Counts the number of unique patients who received a biologic drug treatment in that month. `KEEP_IF` ensures that only `patient_id_val`s associated with biologic treatments are considered for the distinct count.

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter the patients using a `WHERE` clause to find those whose `email` field ends with ""@gmail.com"" or ""@yahoo.com"". The `ENDSWITH` function will be used for this, and the conditions will be combined with an OR (`|`) operator.
3.  Count the resulting number of patients using the `COUNT` aggregation function. This count will be assigned to a new field in a `CALCULATE` clause on the `DermTreatment` graph.

2.  Uses `CALCULATE` to define a new field `num_patients_gmail_yahoo`.

        *   `speciality`: The doctor's specialty.
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`. It counts the number of unique drug IDs found across all treatments prescribed by the doctor. `prescribed_treatments` is a sub-collection of treatments for a doctor, and `drug.drug_id` accesses the ID of the drug used in each of those treatments.

2.  `partitioned_by_specialty = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection (which contains doctors with their distinct drug counts).
    *   It partitions these doctors into groups based on their `speciality`. Each group, named `""specialty_group""`, will contain all doctors belonging to a particular specialty.

3.  `result = partitioned_by_specialty.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line processes the doctors within each `specialty_group`. `partitioned_by_specialty.Doctors` refers to the individual doctor records within each partition.
    *   It calculates the final set of requested fields:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID (carried over).
        *   `speciality`: The doctor's specialty (carried over, this is the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: The number of distinct drugs prescribed (carried over).

1.  **Identify New Patients and Their First Treatment Year**:
    *   A ""new patient"" is defined as a patient starting their first-ever treatment.
    *   We start with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   For each patient's set of treatments, we use `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""patient"") == 1` to identify their first treatment(s). Since `allow_ties` defaults to `False`, if multiple treatments share the earliest start date for a patient, one will be chosen. This is sufficient as we only need to establish the year the patient became ""new"".
    *   From these first treatments, we extract the `YEAR(start_dt)`. This collection, `first_treatments_info`, will effectively have one entry per patient, marking the year they became a new patient.

2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**:
    *   We partition `first_treatments_info` by the `first_treatment_year_val` (the year of the first treatment).
    *   Within each year's partition, `COUNT(Treatments)` counts the number of records from `first_treatments_info` that fall into that year. Since each record represents a unique new patient for that year, this gives us `num_new_patients_for_calc` for each `year_val_for_calc`.
    *   The results are ordered by year in `yearly_new_patient_counts` to prepare for the `PREV` function.

3.  **Calculate NPI**:
    *   NPI is the increase in the number of new patients compared to the previous year.
    *   This is calculated as `num_new_patients_for_calc - PREV(num_new_patients_for_calc, by=year_val_for_calc.ASC())`.
    *   The `PREV` function looks up the number of new patients from the immediately preceding year (due to the `ORDER_BY` clause).
    *   For the earliest year in the dataset, `PREV` will return `None` (as its `default` is `None` if not specified), making the NPI for that first year also `None`, which correctly indicates no prior year for comparison.

1.  Create a filtered collection named `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`. This collection will contain records from the `Outcomes` table where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We assume that comparing a field to itself (`field == field`) evaluates to false if the field is NULL, thereby filtering out NULLs. This is a common behavior in SQL-like systems where `NULL == NULL` is UNKNOWN, and `WHERE UNKNOWN` is false.
2.  At the `DermTreatment` graph level, calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` (as `avg_pasi_d7_value`) and average `day100_pasi_score` (as `avg_pasi_d100_value`) using the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.

2.  `.CALCULATE(doctor_residence_state=loc_state)`: For the filtered doctors, this creates a new collection where each record contains the `loc_state` of the doctor, aliased as `doctor_residence_state`.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=(doctor_residence_state))`: This partitions the collection of doctor states by `doctor_residence_state`. Each group in the partition will correspond to a unique state.
4.  `.CALCULATE(state=doctor_residence_state)`: From each unique state group created by the partition, this line selects the `doctor_residence_state` and renames it to `state`. This effectively gives a list of distinct states.

2.  **Extract Necessary Data**: For these filtered treatments, we need the patient's insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) and the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`) for distinct counting. The `day100_pasi_score` will be accessed from the `outcome_records` associated with these treatments.
3.  **Group by Insurance Type**: Partition the prepared data by the patient's insurance type.
4.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each insurance type group:
    *   Calculate the average `day100_pasi_score` from all outcome records of treatments in that group.
    *   Count the number of distinct patient IDs in that group.
5.  **Sort and Limit**: Order the results by the calculated average PASI score in ascending order (lowest first) and select the top 5.
6.  **Select Final Fields**: Ensure the output includes the insurance type, the average PASI score at day 100, and the count of distinct patients.

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments_data = Treatments.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)` filters these treatments to include only those that ended in the year 2022.
    *   `CALCULATE(pat_ins_type = patient.ins_type, pat_id = patient.patient_id)` creates a new working collection where each record (representing a treatment) now has `pat_ins_type` (the patient's insurance type) and `pat_id` (the patient's ID) directly associated with it. These will be used for partitioning and aggregation.

2.  `insurance_type_summary = filtered_treatments_data.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(pat_ins_type))` groups the records from `filtered_treatments_data` based on the `pat_ins_type`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(...)` operates on each of these groups:
        *   `insurance_type = pat_ins_type`:  Selects the insurance type (which is the partition key).
        *   `avg_pasi_score_day100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score`. `Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score` refers to the `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of all treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(pat_id)`: Counts the number of unique patient IDs (`pat_id` that we prepared earlier) within the current insurance type group.

3.  `result = insurance_type_summary.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_day100.ASC())`:
    *   This takes the `insurance_type_summary` (which contains insurance types and their calculated metrics).
    *   `TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_day100.ASC())` sorts these records by `avg_pasi_score_day100` in ascending order (lowest score first) and returns only the top 5 records.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `Patients` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the patients into groups based on their `ins_type`. Each group will be named ""insurance\_groups"" internally, and the partitioning key is `ins_type`.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` to compute aggregated values for each `ins_type` group.
    *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` for each group and rename it to `insurance_type`.
    *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that specific `ins_type` group.
    *   `avg_weight_kg=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Similarly, we calculate the average `weight_kg` for patients in that group.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 insurance types.
    *   `3`: Specifies that we want the top 3 records.
    *   `by=avg_height_cm.DESC()`: Orders the groups by `avg_height_cm` in descending order (highest average height first) before picking the top 3.

2.  Filter the `Treatments` collection based on three main conditions:
    *   The associated diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitively, using wildcards). This is checked using `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`.
    *   The drug used in the treatment is FDA-approved. We interpret this as the drug having a non-null `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), checked using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.

3.  `qualifying_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Treatments` collection and then applies a series of filters:
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: Filters treatments where the associated diagnosis's name (`diag_name`) contains ""psoriasis"". `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: Filters treatments where the associated drug has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`), implying it's FDA-approved.

    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record per doctor) into a singular object, allowing direct access to its fields like `start_dt` and `treatment_id`.

**Explanation:**

The query first selects `Treatments` that are placebos (`is_placebo == True`) and have associated concomitant medications (`HAS(concomitant_meds) == 1`).

Then, for each of these selected treatments, it navigates to its `concomitant_meds`. It filters these medications to include only those whose start date (`start_dt`) is within a 2-week window (14 days before or 14 days after) of the treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`). This date condition is checked using `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` ensuring the result is between -14 and 14, inclusive.

Finally, the `CALCULATE` function retrieves the following fields:

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To calculate the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Filter the `Patients` collection to include only those who are 'Male' and have 'Private' insurance.
2.  For these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years by finding the difference between the current date and their `date_of_birth`.
3.  Compute the average of these calculated ages.
4.  Round the final average age to the nearest integer.

The query will use the `DermTreatment` high-level collection to output the final aggregated average age.

2.  `patients_with_age = filtered_patients.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For the `filtered_patients`, this line calculates a new field `current_age_in_years`. The age is determined by using the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference in ""years"" between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (obtained via `DATETIME('now')`).
3.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(average_male_patient_age_private_insurance = ROUND(AVG(patients_with_age.current_age_in_years), 0))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   It operates on the `DermTreatment` graph level to produce a single aggregated value.
    *   `AVG(patients_with_age.current_age_in_years)` computes the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients in the `patients_with_age` collection.
    *   `ROUND(..., 0)` rounds this average age to 0 decimal places, effectively converting it to the nearest integer.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: The merchant's `name` is stored in `merchant_name_val`.
    *   `successful_merchant_transactions = transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"")`: For each merchant, we access their `transactions_received` and filter them to keep only those with `status == ""completed""`. This filtered sub-collection is stored as `successful_merchant_transactions`.
    *   `distinct_coupons_count_val = NDISTINCT(successful_merchant_transactions.WHERE(HAS(coupon)==1).coupon.cid)`: We count the number of unique coupons used in these successful transactions.
        *   `successful_merchant_transactions.WHERE(HAS(coupon)==1)`: Further filters the successful transactions to include only those that have an associated coupon.
        *   `.coupon.cid`: Accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the coupon used in each of these transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `cid` values.
    *   `distinct_transactions_count_val = COUNT(successful_merchant_transactions.txid)`: We count the total number of successful transactions for the merchant by counting their `txid`s.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` step takes the results from the first and computes the final output.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: Selects the merchant's name for the output.
    *   `CPUR = IFF(distinct_transactions_count_val > 0, distinct_coupons_count_val / distinct_transactions_count_val, 0.0)`: Calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`: This function checks if `distinct_transactions_count_val` is greater than 0.
        *   If true (there are successful transactions), CPUR is `distinct_coupons_count_val / distinct_transactions_count_val`.
        *   If false (no successful transactions), CPUR is `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   `current_week_start_val` captures the start timestamp of the current week (e.g., if today is Wednesday, it's the timestamp for the preceding Monday, assuming week starts on Monday).
    *   `three_weeks_prior_start_val` calculates the timestamp for the start of the week that was exactly three weeks prior to `current_week_start_val`. This marks the beginning of our 3-week analysis period.

2.  **User Filtering (`relevant_users`)**:
    *   We start by filtering the `Users` collection to include only users whose `country` field is either ""US"" or ""Canada"" using `ISIN(country, (""US"", ""Canada""))`.

3.  **Notification Processing (`user_notifications_with_week_info`)**:
    *   We access the `notifications` sub-collection for the `relevant_users`.
    *   Using `CALCULATE`, we derive two new fields for each notification:
        *   `notification_week_start`: This is calculated by truncating the notification's `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`. This aligns with the requirement ""Truncate created_at to week for aggregation.""
        *   `day_name_of_creation`: This extracts the name of the day (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from `created_at` using `DAYNAME(created_at)`.

4.  **Time Window Filtering (`notifications_in_target_period`)**:
    *   The processed notifications are then filtered using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `notification_week_start` falls within our target 3-week period. The condition `(notification_week_start >= three_weeks_prior_start_val) & (notification_week_start < current_week_start_val)` ensures we include notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.

5.  **Weekly Aggregation (`weekly_notification_counts`)**:
    *   We use `PARTITION` to group the `notifications_in_target_period` by the `notification_week_start`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `week`: This is the `notification_week_start` (the partition key), representing the week for which the counts are being reported.
        *   `total_notifications`: `COUNT(Notifications)` counts all notifications belonging to that specific week's partition for the selected users.
        *   `weekend_notifications`: `SUM(IFF(ISIN(day_name_of_creation, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")), 1, 0))` counts notifications sent on a weekend. The `IFF` function returns 1 if `day_name_of_creation` is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", and 0 otherwise. `SUM` then adds these up for all notifications in the week's partition.

6.  **Ordering (`result`)**:
    *   Finally, the `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` clause sorts the weekly summaries chronologically by the `week` start date.

1.  Identify all transactions sent by users. We can access the `Transactions` collection and check for the presence of a `sending_user`.
2.  Filter these transactions to include only those where the `sending_user`'s `country` is ""US"".
3.  Further filter these transactions to include only those `created_at` within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This can be achieved by checking if the number of days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 6. `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` covers today (0 days diff) up to 6 full days prior.
4.  Finally, aggregate these filtered transactions to get the total count and the sum of their `amount`. This will be done using the `Ewallet` graph.

```python

    total_transaction_amount = SUM(us_user_recent_transactions.amount)

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `us_user_recent_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a collection of transactions that meet specific criteria:
    *   `(HAS(sending_user) == 1)`: Ensures that the transaction was sent by a user (i.e., the `sending_user` relationship exists).
    *   `(sending_user.country == ""US"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the sending user's country is ""US"".
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: Filters the transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days, inclusive of the current day. `DATEDIFF(""days"", date1, date2)` calculates the number of full day boundaries crossed between `date1` and `date2`. If `created_at` is today, the difference is 0. If it was 6 days ago, the difference is 6. Thus, `<= 6` covers a 7-day period ending today.

2.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This line performs the final aggregation on the `Ewallet` graph:

1.  **Filter `UserBalances`**: Select only the user balance records that were updated within the last 7 days (inclusive). We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` for this, where `DATETIME('now')` gives the current date and `updated_at` is the timestamp of the balance update.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: For each user, calculate their average balance using only their balance records from the filtered set. This is achieved by partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id` and then calculating the `AVG(UserBalances.balance)` for each user group. This value represents the AMB for each specific user over the defined period.
3.  **Calculate the Average of AMBs**: Finally, compute the average of all the per-user AMBs calculated in the previous step. This will give the overall average AMB for user wallets that had updates in the specified timeframe.

The final result will be a single scalar value representing this overall average AMB.

1.  Access the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we will retrieve their `uid`.
3.  To determine the LUB:
    *   We first check if the user has any associated balance records in the `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserBalances`).
    *   If balances exist, we use `TOP_K(1, by=updated_at.DESC(na_pos='last'))` on the `balances` sub-collection. This selects the single balance record with the most recent `updated_at` timestamp. `na_pos='last'` ensures that any null `updated_at` values are sorted last and thus not picked as the latest if valid timestamps exist.
    *   The `SINGULAR()` function is then used to explicitly treat the result of `TOP_K(1, ...)` as a single record.
    *   From this single, most recent balance record, we extract the `balance` field.
    *   If a user has no balance records, their LUB will be set to `None`. This is handled using the `IFF` function.
4.  The final output will include the user's identifier (`user_uid`) and their calculated `LUB`.

*   `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation iterates over each user in the `Users` collection and computes new fields.
*   `user_uid=uid`: Selects the `uid` field from the `Users` collection and renames it to `user_uid`.
*   `LUB=IFF(...)`: This defines the `LUB` field. The `IFF` function provides conditional logic.
    *   `HAS(balances) == 1`: This is the condition. It checks if the current user has at least one record in their `balances` sub-collection.

        *   `.TOP_K(1, by=updated_at.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: Selects the top 1 balance record, ordered by `updated_at` in descending order. Null `updated_at` values are placed last.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the result of `TOP_K(1, ...)` is a single record (or none if `balances` was empty or `TOP_K` returned nothing).
        *   `.balance`: Extracts the `balance` attribute from that single, most recent balance record.

The PMDAU is specifically defined as the count of ""distinct sender with sender_type = 0"".
Additionally, it's specified to ""Truncate created_at to month for aggregation"".

Based on this definition and instruction, PMDAU here means: for each relevant month, count the number of unique senders (where sender_type is 0) who made at least one transaction in that month.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Determine the Date Range**: We need transactions from the start of the month that was two months ago, up to (but not including) the start of the current month.
    *   `inclusive_start_date`: `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')` (e.g., if today is July 15th, this is May 1st).
    *   `exclusive_end_date`: `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (e.g., if today is July 15th, this is July 1st).
    This range covers the entirety of the two full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that:
    *   Fall within the determined date range.
    *   Have `sender_type == 0`.

3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For the filtered transactions, calculate a field representing the year and month of the transaction. This is done by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the start of its month. This field will serve as the grouping key.

4.  **Group and Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   Partition the prepared transactions by the year-month field.
    *   For each month-group, count the number of distinct `sender_id`s. This count is the PMDAU for that month.

5.  **Output**: The result should show each relevant month and its corresponding PMDAU.

```python
# Step 1: Define date boundaries for filtering.
# 'inclusive_start_date' is the beginning of the two-month period (e.g., May 1st if current month is July).

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_config = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This step defines the time window for our analysis. `inclusive_start_date` marks the beginning of the two-month period before the current month, and `exclusive_end_date` marks the beginning of the current month. Transactions on or after `inclusive_start_date` and before `exclusive_end_date` will be considered.

2.  `transactions_for_pmdau = date_config.Transactions.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with `date_config.Transactions` to access all transactions and utilize the calculated date boundaries.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions to include only those within our defined date range and where `sender_type == 0`.
    *   `CALCULATE(transaction_year_month_key = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month'))` processes each filtered transaction to create a new field `transaction_year_month_key`. This field holds the first day of the month for the transaction's `created_at` date, effectively truncating the date to its month, as requested for aggregation.

3.  `result = transactions_for_pmdau.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_active_users_group"", by=(transaction_year_month_key))` groups the records in `transactions_for_pmdau` based on the `transaction_year_month_key`. This creates a group for each month in the specified two-month period that has relevant transaction activity.
    *   `.CALCULATE(report_month = transaction_year_month_key, pmdau = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id))`: For each monthly group:
        *   `report_month = transaction_year_month_key`:  The `transaction_year_month_key` (which represents the month) is selected for the output.
        *   `pmdau = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: The PMDAU is calculated by counting the number of unique `sender_id` values from the original `Transactions` table that belong to this specific month's group. This directly implements the definition ""distinct sender with sender_type = 0"" aggregated per month.

The final `result` will contain one row for each of the two months in the analysis period, showing the month (`report_month`) and the calculated PMDAU (`pmdau`) for that month.",90.09833121299744,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for filtering.

3.  For each of the remaining users, calculate their `uid` (as `user_id`) and the total count of transactions they have sent using `COUNT(transactions_sent)`.

1.  `Users`: We start by selecting the `Users` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(user_type != 'merchant')`: This filters the users, keeping only those whose `user_type` is not equal to `'merchant'`. This step ensures we are only considering users who are not classified as merchants.

1.  **Filter Sessions**: We'll start by selecting sessions from the `UserSessions` collection that were active during the specified date range. A session is considered active if it started before the end of the range (`2023-06-08`) and ended on or after the start of the range (`2023-06-01`). We also ensure that sessions have an `session_end_ts`.
2.  **Calculate Individual Session Durations**: For each of these filtered sessions, we'll calculate its duration in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. We'll assign the original `user_id` to a new field `user_id_for_grouping` to make the partitioning step clear.
3.  **Group by User and Aggregate Durations**: We'll then use the `PARTITION` method to group these sessions by `user_id_for_grouping`. For each user, we'll `SUM` the calculated `single_session_duration_sec` to get their total session duration. The output fields will be `user_id` (from `user_id_for_grouping`) and `total_duration`.
4.  **Sort Results**: Finally, the results will be sorted by `total_duration` in descending order, showing users with the longest session durations first.

The `DATETIME()` function is used to correctly parse the date strings for comparison.

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sessions based on their `session_start_ts`.
    *   `session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This condition ensures that the session started on or after one month ago from the current time. `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` dynamically calculates this past timestamp.
    *   `session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now')`: This condition ensures that the session started on or before the current time.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only sessions falling within the last month (inclusive of exactly one month ago up to the present moment) are selected.

2.  `tuc_calculation = Ewallet.CALCULATE(TUC = COUNT(sessions_in_defined_period))`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the root `Ewallet` collection to define global context variables.
    *   `_target_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month'))`: Calculates the year of the first day of the previous month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the start of the current month, and `'-1 month'` subtracts one month from it.
    *   `_target_month = MONTH(DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month'))`: Calculates the month number (1-12) of the previous month.

2.  The subsequent `.CALCULATE(...)` uses these `_target_year` and `_target_month` values:
    *   `_num_successful_tx = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(...))`: Counts transactions from the `Transactions` collection that meet three conditions:
        *   `YEAR(created_at) == _target_year`: The transaction's creation year matches the target previous year.
        *   `MONTH(created_at) == _target_month`: The transaction's creation month matches the target previous month.
        *   `status == 'completed'`: The transaction's status is 'completed', which we assume signifies a successful transaction.
    *   `_num_total_tx = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(...))`: Counts all transactions from the `Transactions` collection whose creation year and month match `_target_year` and `_target_month`, respectively.

3.  The next `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `str_value = IFF(_num_total_tx > 0, (_num_successful_tx * 100.0) / _num_total_tx, 0.0)`: Calculates the Success Transaction Rate.
        *   `IFF(_num_total_tx > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This checks if there were any transactions in the previous month. If `_num_total_tx` is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division.
        *   `(_num_successful_tx * 100.0) / _num_total_tx`: If there were transactions, this calculates the STR as a percentage (multiplying by 100.0).
        *   If `_num_total_tx` is 0 (no transactions), `str_value` is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.

4.  The final `.CALCULATE(str_previous_month = str_value)`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_creation_info`: We first iterate through all `Merchants`. For each merchant, we calculate `merchant_creation_yr` (the year the merchant was created) and `merchant_creation_mth` (the month the merchant was created). We also select `mid` and `name` using aliases `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val` to carry them forward.
2.  `merchant_coupons_count`: Building upon the previous step, for each merchant (now with their creation year and month available), we access their `coupons` sub-collection. We then filter these coupons to keep only those whose `created_at` year and month match the `merchant_creation_yr` and `merchant_creation_mth` respectively. The `COUNT` function then counts how many such coupons exist for each merchant, storing this as `num_coupons_same_month_as_creation`. The merchant's `mid` and `name` are also carried forward.
3.  `top_merchant_details`: We use `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_same_month_as_creation.DESC())` to find the single merchant who has the highest count of coupons created in their own creation month. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
4.  `result`: Finally, we select and rename the fields from the top merchant record to match the requested output: `mid` (for merchant ID), `name` (for merchant name), and `num_coupons` (for the count of coupons).",29.38276171684265,"# Step 1: Calculate merchant's creation year and month, and keep essential merchant details.

    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications`: the count of their notifications that meet the criteria: `notification_type` is 'promotional' AND `status` is 'unread'.
4.  Finally, filter these results to include only users for whom `total_unread_promotional_notifications` is greater than 0.

```python
# Filter users by country and calculate the count of unread promotional notifications
users_with_unread_promo_notifications = Users.WHERE(LOWER(country) == 'us').CALCULATE(
    username=username,
    total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(

    )
)

# Filter out users who have no such notifications
result = users_with_unread_promo_notifications.WHERE(total_unread_promotional_notifications > 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(LOWER(country) == 'us')`: This selects users from the `Users` collection and filters them to include only those where the lowercase version of their `country` field is 'us'.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered US-based users.
    *   `username=username`: Selects the `username` field from the `Users` collection and includes it in the output with the same name.
    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(...)`: This calculates a new field named `total_unread_promotional_notifications`.
        *   `notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`: For each user, this accesses their `notifications` sub-collection and filters these notifications to include only those where `notification_type` is exactly 'promotional' and `status` is exactly 'unread'.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the number of notifications that satisfy the inner `WHERE` condition for each user.
3.  `result = users_with_unread_promo_notifications.WHERE(total_unread_promotional_notifications > 0)`: This takes the result from the previous step (which contains usernames and their respective counts of unread promotional notifications) and filters it further. It keeps only those rows (users) where the `total_unread_promotional_notifications` is greater than 0, ensuring that only users who actually have unread promotional notifications are included in the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    First, we process the `Transactions` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to extract the year (`tr_year`) and month (`tr_month`) from the `created_at` timestamp. We also bring forward `sender_id`, `sender_type`, and `status` into new fields (`tr_sender_id`, `tr_sender_type`, `tr_status`) for clarity and use in subsequent steps.

2.  **`filtered_transactions = transaction_details.WHERE(...)`**:
    Next, we filter these processed transactions. The `WHERE` clause ensures we only consider transactions that:
    *   Occurred in the year 2023 (`tr_year == 2023`).
    *   Were sent by a 'user' (`tr_sender_type == ""user""`), thereby excluding merchants.
    *   Were 'successful' (`tr_status == ""successful""`).

3.  **`monthly_summary = filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**:
    We then `PARTITION` the `filtered_transactions` by `tr_year` and `tr_month`. This groups all relevant transactions by the month they occurred in.
    For each monthly group, we `CALCULATE`:
    *   `month_as_date`: A string representing the first day of the month in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. This is constructed using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` to ensure the month number is two digits (e.g., '01' for January).
    *   `num_active_users`: The number of distinct users who sent money in that month. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.tr_sender_id)`, which counts the unique `tr_sender_id` values within each month's partition.

4.  **`result = monthly_summary.ORDER_BY(month_as_date.ASC())`**:
    Finally, the `monthly_summary` (which contains one row per month with the formatted date and the count of distinct active users) is sorted by `month_as_date` in ascending order, so the results start from the earliest month in 2023.

The query effectively counts unique users who made successful sending transactions each month in 2023, presenting the result with a formatted month string and ordered chronologically.",68.71503400802612,"# Step 1: Calculate year, month, and rename fields for clarity from Transactions

2.  For these filtered transactions, we extract necessary information: the country of the sending user (`sending_user.country`), the transaction amount (`amount`), and the UID of the sending user (`sending_user.uid`). These are calculated into new fields.
3.  We then partition these processed transactions by the `sender_country`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_transactions_data = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `WHERE(sender_type == 0)` filters for transactions where the sender is a user.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then creates an intermediate collection where for each of these transactions, we derive:
        *   `derived_sender_country`: The country of the user who sent the transaction (accessed via `sending_user.country`).
        *   `derived_tx_amount`: The amount of the transaction (this is just `amount` from the transaction, renamed for clarity in the intermediate step, though not strictly necessary to rename if not used directly in SUM/NDISTINCT later).
        *   `derived_sender_uid`: The UID of the sending user (accessed via `sending_user.uid`).

2.  `grouped_by_country = user_transactions_data.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `user_transactions_data` and partitions it into groups based on the `derived_sender_country`. Each group `country_transactions_group` contains all transaction data for a specific country.

3.  `country_statistics = grouped_by_country.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   For each country group created by the partition:
        *   `country = derived_sender_country`: We select the country name.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: We calculate the sum of transaction amounts. This `SUM` refers to the `amount` field of the original `Transactions` records that satisfy the initial `sender_type == 0` filter and belong to the current country group.
        *   `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: We count the number of unique user UIDs. This `NDISTINCT` refers to the `uid` of the `sending_user` associated with the original `Transactions` records satisfying the same conditions.

4.  `top_countries_result = country_statistics.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, we take the `country_statistics` (which has one record per country with its total transaction amount and distinct user count) and select the top 5 records, ordered by `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

The condition ensures that the earliest coupon's start date (`ec_start_date_val`) is on or after the merchant's registration date (`m_created_at_val`) and no later than one year after the registration date. The `DATETIME(m_created_at_val, '1 year')` function calculates this upper bound.
6.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` step to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `merchant_id`, `registration_date`, `earliest_coupon_id`, and `start_date` (for the coupon).

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we capture their `username`, `email`, and `created_at` (signup date). We'll alias `created_at` to `u_signup_dt` to make it clearly available for subsequent operations.
3.  We then filter these users. A user is kept if they do *not* have any notification that meets the following criteria:
    *   The notification's `created_at` timestamp is on or after the user's `u_signup_dt`.
    *   The notification's `created_at` timestamp is before one year from the user's `u_signup_dt`. The end of this one-year period is calculated using `DATETIME(u_signup_dt, '+1 year')`.
    *   The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check for the absence of such notifications. The inner `WHERE` clause on the `notifications` sub-collection defines the criteria for a notification being ""within the first year"".
4.  Finally, from the filtered list of users, we select and rename the fields to `username`, `email`, and `signup_date` as requested.
