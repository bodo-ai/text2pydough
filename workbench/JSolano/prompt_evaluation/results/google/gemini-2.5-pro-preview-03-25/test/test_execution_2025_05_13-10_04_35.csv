1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate the total number of transactions they've made (`total_transactions_val`) and the number of transactions with a 'Completed' status (`successful_transactions_val`). We assume 'Completed' signifies a successful transaction.
3.  Filter these customers to include only those where `total_transactions_val` is 5 or more.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate the `success_rate` as `(successful_transactions_val * 100.0) / total_transactions_val`.
5.  Select the customer's name and their calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Order the results by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

# Step 1: Calculate total and successful transaction counts for each customer.
# We assume a transaction is successful if its status is ""Completed"".
customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(
    c_name=name,
    total_transactions_val=COUNT(transactions_made),

# Step 2: Filter for customers who have made at least 5 transactions.
eligible_customers_data = customer_transaction_summary.WHERE(total_transactions_val >= 5)

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each customer:
        *   `c_name=name`: Stores the customer's name.
        *   `total_transactions_val=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts all transactions associated with the customer via the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `successful_transactions_val=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts transactions associated with the customer that have a `status` of ""Completed"". This is our definition of a successful transaction.

2.  `eligible_customers_data = customer_transaction_summary.WHERE(total_transactions_val >= 5)`:
    *   This line takes the `customer_transaction_summary` (which has the transaction counts).
    *   It applies a `WHERE` filter to keep only those customers for whom `total_transactions_val` (the total number of transactions they made) is greater than or equal to 5.

3.  `result = eligible_customers_data.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `eligible_customers_data`.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` again to compute the final output fields:
        *   `customer_name=c_name`: Selects the customer's name (which was stored as `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate=(successful_transactions_val * 100.0) / total_transactions_val`: Calculates the success rate as a percentage. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures floating-point division for an accurate percentage. Since `total_transactions_val` is guaranteed to be at least 5 (due to the previous `WHERE` clause), division by zero is not a concern here.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`: Finally, the results are ordered by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).

The final `result` variable will contain a collection of customers, each with their name and their transaction success rate, ordered appropriately.",29.07270765304565,"# Step 1: Calculate total and successful transaction counts for each customer.

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` graph to calculate a single aggregate value.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the date range for ""the last 8 weeks excluding the current week"".
    *   `current_week_start_val`: The start date of the current week. Transactions on or after this date are excluded.
    *   `limit_start_date_for_weeks`: The start date of the week that was 8 weeks ago. This forms the inclusive lower bound for our period of interest.
    These are calculated once at the `Broker` (top) level.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   Start with `Broker.Transactions`.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those related to 'stock' by checking `ticker.ticker_type`.
    *   Further filter these transactions to include only those whose `date_time` falls within our defined 8-week period. The start of the week for each transaction (`DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`) is used for this comparison.
    *   For the filtered transactions, calculate two new fields:
        *   `transaction_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_txn`: A flag (1 if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, 0 otherwise). This is determined using `DAYNAME()` and `ISIN()`.

3.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the prepared transactions by `transaction_week_start`.
    *   For each week (each partition group):
        *   Rename `transaction_week_start` to `week_start_display` for the output.
        *   Count the total number of transactions in that group (`total_stock_transactions_in_week = COUNT(Transactions)`).
        *   Sum the `is_weekend_txn` flag to get the count of weekend transactions (`weekend_stock_transactions_in_week = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_txn)`).

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Order the weekly summaries by `week_start_display` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts with the `Broker` collection, as we need a single aggregated result (number of transactions and total amount).
2.  The first `CALCULATE` function defines two helper variables for date boundaries:
    *   `_start_of_last_week_boundary`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week prior to the current week. This is achieved by taking the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
    *   `_start_of_current_week_boundary`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    Transactions from ""last week"" are those that occurred on or after `_start_of_last_week_boundary` and before `_start_of_current_week_boundary`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` function computes the required metrics:
    *   `num_transactions`:
        *   It accesses `Customers` and filters them using `WHERE(country == ""USA"")`.
        *   Then, it navigates to their `transactions_made`.
        *   These transactions are further filtered using `WHERE((date_time >= _start_of_last_week_boundary) & (date_time < _start_of_current_week_boundary))` to include only those from last week.
        *   Finally, `COUNT()` aggregates these filtered transactions to get the total number.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`:
        *   It uses the same path to filter transactions from US customers made last week.
        *   `SUM()` then aggregates the `amount` field of these filtered transactions to get the total transaction value.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate:
    *   `customer_name`: Directly from the `name` field.
    *   `num_transactions`: By counting the number of transactions in their `transactions_made` sub-collection using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `total_trans_amount`: By summing the `amount` of all transactions in their `transactions_made` sub-collection using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)`.
3.  After these calculations, create a new calculated field `CR` (Customer Rank). This rank will be determined by the `total_trans_amount` in descending order (highest total amount gets rank 1). This is achieved using the `RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())` window function.
4.  The final result will include `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, `total_trans_amount`, and `CR`.

```python
customer_transaction_summary_with_rank = Customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),

    num_transactions=num_transactions,
    total_trans_amount=total_trans_amount,
    CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes the `Customers` collection.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name and renames it to `customer_name`.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer from their `transactions_made` list and names this count `num_transactions`.
    *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer and names this sum `total_trans_amount`.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call operates on the result of the first one.
    *   `customer_name=customer_name`, `num_transactions=num_transactions`, `total_trans_amount=total_trans_amount`: These expressions ensure that the fields calculated in the previous step are carried forward to the final result.
    *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: This calculates the rank for each customer. The `RANKING` function is applied based on the `total_trans_amount` field in descending order (`DESC()`), so the customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1. This rank is stored in the `CR` field.

1.  Start with the `Transactions` collection.
2.  Calculate intermediate fields for the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), transaction date-time (`date_time`), and transaction type (`transaction_type`). This makes them available for filtering and partitioning.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those where the `transaction_type` is ""BUY"".
4.  Further filter these ""BUY"" transactions to include only those that occurred within the ""past 10 days"". We define ""past 10 days"" as a 10-day window including the current day. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_dt, DATETIME('now')) <= 9`, which covers transactions from 0 days ago (today) up to 9 days ago.
5.  Partition the filtered transactions by the ticker symbol (`ticker_s`).
6.  For each ticker symbol group, calculate the `ticker_symbol` (from the partition key) and the total number of buy transactions (`num_buy_transactions`) using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
7.  Finally, use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Determine the Time Window**: We need to identify customers whose `join_date` falls within the last 6 full months. This means from the start of the month 6 months ago up to (but not including) the start of the current month.
    *   We'll use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the beginning of the current month.
    *   We'll use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` to get the beginning of the period (6 months prior to the current month's start).

2.  **Filter Customers**: Select customers whose `join_date` is within this calculated time window. We'll also extract the year and month of their `join_date` for grouping.

3.  **Group by Signup Month**: Partition the filtered customers by the year and month they signed up.

4.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month group, count the number of customers. This will be `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month group, calculate the average transaction `amount` from all transactions made by the customers in that group. This will be `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. We'll use `DEFAULT_TO` to set it to 0.0 if there are no transactions.

5.  **Output**: The result should include the signup year, signup month, PMCS, and PMAT, ordered chronologically.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two key dates using the `Broker` (top-level) collection:
    *   `start_of_current_month`: The first day of the current month. Customer signups must be *before* this date.
    *   `start_of_target_period`: The first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month's start. Customer signups must be *on or after* this date.

2.  `customers_in_period = date_info.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them based on their `join_date` to include only those who signed up within the defined six-month window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))`: For these filtered customers, we derive their signup year (`signup_year_val`) and signup month (`signup_month_val`). These will be used as keys for grouping.

3.  `result = customers_in_period.PARTITION(...)`: We partition the `customers_in_period` collection.
    *   `name=""monthly_signup_group"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val)`: This groups the customers by unique combinations of their signup year and month.

4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (i.e., for each signup month):
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val, signup_month=signup_month_val`: We select the signup year and month.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` records within the current partition group (i.e., signed up in that specific month).
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: This calculates the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT). It takes all transactions (`transactions_made`) of all customers within the current partition group and computes the average of their `amount`. If there are no transactions for the group, `AVG` would be null, so `DEFAULT_TO` ensures `pmat` is 0.0 in such cases.

The AR is defined as: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

To implement this, we make the following interpretations:
1.  ""Customers who joined in 2022"": We filter customers based on `YEAR(join_date) == 2022`.
2.  ""Active Customers"": We interpret this as customers whose `status` field is 'Active'.
3.  ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"": These are customers who joined in 2022, have `status == 'Active'`, AND have made at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This forms the numerator of the AR.
4.  ""Total Number of Customers with Transactions"": These are customers who joined in 2022 AND have made at least one transaction. This forms the denominator of the AR.

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection for those who joined in 2022.
2.  For these customers, calculate two boolean flags:

    *   `is_denominator_candidate`: True if the customer has transactions.
    *   Also, retain the `country` for partitioning.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `country`.
4.  For each country group:

1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Convert the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
3.  Filter customers where their lowercase name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
4.  Further filter these customers to include only those whose lowercase state ends with 'a'.
5.  Count the number of customers who meet all these criteria.
6.  The final result will be a single count, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter customers based on the specified name and state conditions
filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(
    (STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')) &
    ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')
)

# Calculate the total number of customers matching the criteria
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    number_of_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Customers` collection.
    *   `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `STARTSWITH(...) | ENDSWITH(...)`: Combines the two name conditions with an OR operator (`|`).
    *   `LOWER(state)`: Converts the customer's state to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`: Checks if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
    *   `(...) & ENDSWITH(...)`: Combines the name condition group with the state condition using an AND operator (`&`).
    The result of this step is a sub-collection of customers who meet all the specified criteria.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(number_of_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   We use the top-level `Broker` collection to perform a final calculation.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: Counts the number of customers in the `filtered_customers` collection (which was defined in the previous step).
    *   `number_of_customers = ...`: Assigns this count to a field named `number_of_customers` in the final output.

The variable `result` will contain a single record with one field, `number_of_customers`, holding the count of customers who satisfy all the given conditions.",22.13735055923462,"# Filter customers based on the specified name and state conditions

1.  **Define Date Range**: Establish the start and end dates for the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"". This will be from `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` to `DATETIME('now')`.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that are of `transaction_type == ""sell""` and fall within the defined date range. For these transactions, we also extract the `ticker.symbol` which will be used for grouping.
3.  **Partition by Ticker Symbol**: Group the filtered transactions by their `ticker.symbol`.
4.  **Aggregate Sales Data**: For each ticker symbol group, calculate the sum of `amount` (Total Amount from Sells), sum of `tax`, and sum of `commission`. These sums are derived from the original `Transactions` data corresponding to the filtered and grouped records.
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Apply the SPM formula: `(Total Amount from Sells - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`. We include a check to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to 0.0 if the Total Amount from Sells is zero.
6.  **Format Output**: The final result will contain the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `spm`.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data (`price_info`)**:
    *   Start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   For each daily price record, extract the ticker's symbol (`ticker.symbol`).
    *   Extract the numeric year (`YEAR(date)`) and month (`MONTH(date)`) for sorting purposes.
    *   Create a formatted month string in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-01"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for the month part.
    *   Include the closing price (`close`), highest price (`high`), and lowest price (`low`) for that day.

2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates (`monthly_aggregates`)**:
    *   Partition the `price_info` data by ticker symbol, numeric year, numeric month, and the formatted month string. This groups all daily records for a specific ticker in a specific month.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each ticker-month):
        *   Calculate the average closing price using `AVG(price_info.close_val)`.
        *   Determine the highest price for the month using `MAX(price_info.high_val)`.
        *   Determine the lowest price for the month using `MIN(price_info.low_val)`.
    *   The result of this step is a collection where each row represents a unique ticker-month with its aggregated price data.

3.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Closing Price (`data_with_prev_close`)**:
    *   To calculate MoMC, we first need the average closing price of the *previous* month for each ticker.
    *   Partition the `monthly_aggregates` collection by ticker symbol. This creates groups of monthly data, one group per ticker.
    *   Within each ticker's group of monthly data, use the `PREV()` window function to get the `avg_close_price` from the preceding month.
        *   The `PREV()` function will be ordered by numeric year and then numeric month to ensure chronological order.
        *   The `per=""ticker_partition_for_momc""` argument ensures `PREV()` operates independently for each ticker.
        *   A `default=None` is used for cases where there is no preceding month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker).

4.  **Calculate MoMC and Format Final Output (`final_result`)**:
    *   Using the `data_with_prev_close` collection (which now includes the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price):
        *   Calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close_price - prev_avg_close_price) / prev_avg_close_price`.
        *   Use `IFF()` to handle cases where `prev_avg_close_price` is `None` or zero, setting MoMC to `None` to avoid errors.
        *   Select and rename the fields for the final output: ticker symbol, month (YYYY-MM format), average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.

We need to return the ticker symbol and this calculated price change for these stocks.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter `DailyPrices` by Date**: First, we filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records within the specified date range (""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"").
2.  **Group by Stock**: The filtered prices are then partitioned by `ticker_id`. This creates groups of price records, where each group belongs to a single, distinct stock.
3.  **Calculate Min Low and Max High per Stock**: For each stock's group of prices within the date range:
    *   `ticker_symbol_val = DailyPrices.ticker.symbol`: The stock's ticker symbol is retrieved from the related `Tickers` table via the `ticker` relationship.
    *   `min_low_price = MIN(DailyPrices.low)`: The lowest 'low' price for that stock during the period is calculated.
    *   `max_high_price = MAX(DailyPrices.high)`: The highest 'high' price for that stock during the period is calculated.
4.  **Calculate Price Change**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `price_change_val` for each stock as the difference between its `max_high_price` and `min_low_price` over the period.
5.  **Select Top 3 Stocks**: `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_val.DESC())` is used to select the three stocks with the largest price changes, ordered in descending order of this change.
6.  **Format Output**: Finally, another `CALCULATE` is used to select and name the output fields as `ticker_symbol` and `price_change`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the specified date range
filtered_daily_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(

This correctly covers all transactions up to the end of March 31, 2023.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each `transaction_type` group created by the partition:
    *   `transaction_type = transaction_type`: Selects the transaction type (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_customers = NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: Calculates the number of unique `customer_id` values within that transaction type group.
    *   `avg_shares = AVG(Transactions.shares)`: Calculates the average of the `shares` for transactions within that group.
4.  `result = grouped_by_type_stats.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`: This takes the results from the previous step and selects the top 3 records, ordered by `num_distinct_customers` in descending order.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection, as each record in this collection represents a distinct ticker.

3.  The condition is that there must exist (`HAS`) at least one record in `historical_prices` where the `date` is greater than or equal to ""2023-04-01"".
4.  For the tickers that satisfy this condition, select their `_id` (which is the ticker's unique identifier) and present it as `ticker_id`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(cust_state=customer.state, tick_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, we create two new fields:
        *   `cust_state`: This is derived from `customer.state`, which accesses the `state` of the customer associated with the transaction.
        *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, which accesses the `ticker_type` of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `transaction_details.PARTITION(name=""state_ticker_combinations"", by=(cust_state, tick_type))`:
    *   We take the `transaction_details` (which now includes `cust_state` and `tick_type` for each transaction).
    *   We partition this data into groups named `state_ticker_combinations`.
    *   The partitioning is done `by` the combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. This means all transactions with the same customer state and ticker type will be in the same group.

3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`:
    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` step:
        *   We select `customer_state` (which is the `cust_state` partition key).
        *   We select `ticker_type` (which is the `tick_type` partition key).
        *   We calculate `number_of_transactions` by applying the `COUNT()` aggregation function to the `Transactions` collection within each partition group. This counts how many transactions fall into each specific (customer state, ticker type) combination.

4.  `.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, we take the result from the previous `CALCULATE` (which is a list of unique state-type combinations and their transaction counts).
    *   We select the top 5 (`TOP_K(5, ...)`) combinations.
    *   The ordering is `by=number_of_transactions.DESC()`, meaning the combinations with the highest number of transactions will be ranked first.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This function is used to select existing fields or derive new ones for the filtered customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This step iterates over the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it calculates:
    *   `customer_identifier`: Stores the customer's `_id`.
    *   `customer_name_val`: Stores the customer's `name`.
    *   `num_sell_transactions_on_date`: This counts the transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for the current customer. The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions to include only those where:
        *   `transaction_type == ""sell""`
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`
        *   `MONTH(date_time) == 4` (April)
        *   `DAY(date_time) == 1`

2.  `top_selling_customer = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_sell_transactions_on_date.DESC())`: This takes the `customer_transaction_counts` collection (which has one record per customer with their specific transaction count) and selects the top 1 record. The selection is ordered by `num_sell_transactions_on_date` in descending order, effectively finding the customer with the most ""sell"" transactions on the specified date.

3.  `result = top_selling_customer.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step takes the single record of the top customer and formats the output fields as requested:
    *   `_id` is taken from the previously calculated `customer_identifier`.
    *   `name` is taken from `customer_name_val`.
    *   `num_transactions` is taken from `num_sell_transactions_on_date`.",44.10218000411987,"# Calculate the number of ""sell"" transactions on 2023-04-01 for each customer

2.  Extract the month from the `date_time` of these filtered transactions.

result = monthly_average_prices.ORDER_BY(month_number.ASC())
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_successful_transactions_with_month`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions based on three conditions:
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
        *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Ensures transactions are from January, February, or March (the first quarter).
        *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then creates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from the `date_time` of the filtered transactions.

2.  `monthly_average_prices`:
    *   We take the `q1_successful_transactions_with_month` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_data"", by=(transaction_month))` groups the transactions by the `transaction_month`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` clause operates on each of these monthly groups:
        *   `month_number = transaction_month`: Selects the month number for the output.
        *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` for all transactions belonging to that specific month within the `monthly_data` partition.

3.  `result`:
    *   `ORDER_BY(month_number.ASC())` sorts the final output by the month number in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`**:
    *   This part starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   It filters the cars based on their `vin_number`.
    *   `LOWER(vin_number)` converts the `vin_number` to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%m5%')` checks if the lowercase `vin_number` contains 'm5' anywhere within it (partial match). This fulfills the requirement to match 'M5' in the VIN case-insensitively and with partial matching.

2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`**:
    *   The filtered cars (those with 'M5' in their VIN) are then partitioned (grouped).
    *   `by=(make, model)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on unique combinations of car `make` and `model`. Each group is named ""model\_group"" internally.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`**:
    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` clause (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars):
        *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` of the car group.
        *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` of the car group.
        *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for that specific car make and model. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` of all cars within the current partition group. `COUNT` aggregates these to get the total sales count for the group.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` operation on the `Salespersons` collection computes:
    *   `first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
    *   `last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
    *   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales associated with the salesperson via the `sales_made` sub-collection. This represents their total sales amount.
    *   `calculated_number_of_sales`: The count of sales records in the `sales_made` sub-collection. This represents the total number of sales they made.
    The result of this step is a new collection where each record corresponds to a salesperson and includes these calculated metrics.

2.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the intermediate collection from the previous step and:
    *   Keeps `first_name` and `last_name`.
    *   Renames `calculated_total_sales` to `total_sales_amount` for the final output.
    *   Renames `calculated_number_of_sales` to `number_of_sales` for the final output.
    *   Calculates `SR` (Sales Rank) using the `RANKING()` function. The ranking is performed on the `calculated_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC()`), so salespersons with higher total sales will receive a better (lower) rank number.

2.  **Determine Inventory Status**: For each car involved in a sale, we check its inventory status. A car is considered ""no longer in inventory"" if it has inventory snapshots and its most recent snapshot (determined by the latest `snapshot_date`) indicates `is_in_inventory` is `False`. If a car has no inventory snapshots, it cannot be confirmed as ""out of inventory"" by this rule and is excluded.
3.  **Filter Relevant Sales**: We filter the sales records to include only those where the associated car meets the ""no longer in inventory"" criteria.
4.  **Group by Make and Model**: The filtered sales are then grouped by the car's make and model.
5.  **Calculate Highest Sale Price**: For each make/model group, we calculate the maximum sale price observed.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_status`: We start by iterating through all `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the sold car (`Sales.car.make`, `Sales.car.model`) and the `sale_price`. We also determine if the car is ""out of inventory"". This is done by checking if the car has any `inventory_snapshots`. If it does, we take the latest snapshot (using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC()).SINGULAR()`) and check if its `is_in_inventory` status is `False`. If the car has no snapshots, or if its latest snapshot shows it's still in inventory, the `is_out_of_inventory_flag` is set to `False`.
2.  `relevant_sales_info`: We then filter `sales_with_status` to keep only those records where `is_out_of_inventory_flag` is `True`. These are sales of cars that have been confirmed to be sold and are no longer in inventory.
3.  `make_model_groups`: The `relevant_sales_info` is partitioned by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. This groups all sales for the same make and model together.
4.  `max_sale_prices_by_make_model`: For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the relevant sales), we calculate the `make`, `model`, and the `highest_sale_price` using `MAX(current_sale_price)` over all sales in that group.
5.  `final_result`: Finally, these aggregated results are ordered by `highest_sale_price` in descending order to show the makes and models with the highest sale prices first.",69.12702751159668,"# Step 1: Process sales to include car details and determine if the car is out of inventory.

The condition will check if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"" OR if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"". We'll use the `LIKE` operator with wildcards (`%`) for partial matching and the `LOWER()` function for case-insensitivity.
3.  For the filtered cars, use the `CALCULATE` method to:
    *   Select the `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `vin_number`.

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Cars` collection based on the specified conditions.
*   `(LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%""))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)` convert the car's make and model to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")` checks if the lowercase make contains ""ford"" anywhere within the string.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")` checks if the lowercase model contains ""mustang"" anywhere within the string.
    *   `|` is the OR operator, so cars matching either condition are included.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to select existing fields and compute new ones for each car that passes the filter.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These select the specified car details.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of `Cars` representing sales of that car, and `sale_price` is a field within those sale records.

1.  **Establish a Calendar of Months**: We need a source for the last 6 months. We'll use the `InventorySnapshots` table, assuming it contains entries covering this period. We'll extract unique months from `snapshot_date`, truncate them to the start of the month, and filter for the last 6 months, excluding the current month.
2.  **Filter Salespersons**: Identify salespersons hired between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023.
3.  **Correlate Sales Data**: For each month in our calendar, we will find all sales that occurred in that specific month and were made by the filtered salespersons.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each month, count the number of such sales (PMSPS) and sum their `sale_price` (PMSR). Use `DEFAULT_TO` for PMSR to ensure 0 if no sales occurred, as `SUM` on an empty set might be null. `COUNT` on an empty set is typically 0.
5.  **Order Results**: Order the final results by month in ascending order.

# Step 5: Order the results by month
final_report = monthly_sales_metrics.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `unique_months_from_snapshots`: This part first takes all `snapshot_date` values from `InventorySnapshots`, truncates them to the start of their respective months (`month_dt`). Then, it uses `PARTITION` to find the unique month start dates. This serves as our source of all possible months.
2.  `calendar_report_months`: We filter these unique months to get only those falling within the last 6 complete months prior to the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_val` is the first day of the current month.
    *   `period_start_inclusive_val` is the first day of the month that was 6 months ago.
    *   The filter `(month_start_date >= period_start_inclusive_val) & (month_start_date < current_month_start_val)` selects these 6 months.
3.  `monthly_sales_metrics`: This is the main calculation step. It iterates through each month obtained in `calendar_report_months`.
    *   `month=month_start_date`:  Selects the month identifier for the output.
    *   `sales_in_month_by_relevant_salespersons`: For each `month_start_date` from the calendar, this sub-query filters the `Sales` collection. It includes sales only if:
        *   The salesperson was hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive).
        *   The sale occurred in the *current* `month_start_date` being processed from `calendar_report_months`. This correlation ensures we are calculating metrics for the correct month.
    *   `PMSPS=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales found by the sub-query for that month. If no sales match, `COUNT` will be 0.
    *   `PMSR=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(...), 0.0)`: Sums the `sale_price` of these sales. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if there are no sales (and `SUM` might return null), PMSR will be 0.0.
4.  `final_report`: The resulting data, now containing a row for each of the 6 target months (assuming `InventorySnapshots` had data for these months) along with their PMSPS and PMSR, is ordered by the `month` in ascending order.

This approach relies on `InventorySnapshots` having entries that cover the last 6 months to ensure all these months appear in the output. If `InventorySnapshots` is sparse for this period, some months might be missing from `calendar_report_months` and thus from the final report.",132.91242098808289,"# Step 1: Create a calendar of the target months using InventorySnapshots

2. For each payment, determine its `payment_date` and the `sale_date` of its associated sale (via `sale_record.sale_date`).
3. Calculate the difference in days between these two dates using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Compute the average of all these calculated day differences.
5. Round the final average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the average number of days between when a sale is made and when its payment is received.
- `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference = DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`: This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For every payment, it calculates `days_difference`, which is the number of days from the `sale_date` of the associated sale (`sale_record.sale_date`) to the `payment_date` of the payment itself. This results in a temporary collection where each row represents a payment and has a `days_difference` column.
- `AVG(...)`: This function then takes all the `days_difference` values calculated in the previous step and computes their average.
- `ROUND(..., 2)`: The calculated average is rounded to 2 decimal places.
- `Dealership.CALCULATE(avg_days_sale_to_payment = ...)`: This creates a final result with a single row and a single column named `avg_days_sale_to_payment`, containing the rounded average. The calculation is performed at the `Dealership` (top) level, providing a global average.",24.61577343940735,"result = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  For these sales, calculate the total revenue, which is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  For these same sales, calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the `cost` of the cars sold. The cost of each car is obtained by navigating from the `Sales` record to its associated `Cars` record via the `car` relationship.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` (top/graph) level to produce a single GPM value.

```python
gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Dealership` level because we want a single aggregated result for all sales in 2023.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For each of these filtered sales, we access its `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, we filter sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale, `car` refers to the related `Cars` record, and `.cost` accesses the cost of that specific car.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the GPM. This is necessary because `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` are defined in the preceding `CALCULATE` and can now be referenced.
5.  `gpm_2023 = IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100)`:
    *   This applies the GPM formula: `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100`.
    *   `IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, ...)`: This is a safeguard to prevent division by zero. If `total_cost_2023` is zero, GPM is set to 0; otherwise, the standard GPM calculation is performed.

The final result, `gpm_for_2023_sales`, will be a collection with a single row and a single column `gpm_2023` containing the calculated Gross Profit Margin.",22.532071828842163,"gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as it contains information about sales, including the `sale_date`, `sale_price`, and a reference to the `car` sold.
2.  For each sale, we need to check its associated car's inventory records. The `Sales.car` relationship gives us access to the `Cars` object, and `Cars.inventory_snapshots` gives us its inventory history.
3.  We filter these sales to include only those where the car was marked as out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the exact same day as the sale (`snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`). The `HAS` function is used to check if at least one such inventory snapshot exists for the car associated with the sale.
4.  From this filtered list of sales, we use `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` to select the single sale that has the highest `sale_price`.
5.  Finally, for this top sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` of the car (via `car.make` and `car.model`) and its `sale_price`.

3.  **Calculate MoM Change**: In the same calculation step, use the `PREV` window function to get the `total_payments_for_month` from the previous month. The MoM change is then calculated as `current_month_total - previous_month_total`. The `PREV` function will use the year and month for ordering to determine the ""previous"" month.
4.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results chronologically by year and month.

This approach will provide results for all months where payment data exists. Months with no payments will not be listed, and the MoM change for a month following a gap will be calculated against the last month that had data.

**Explanation:**

1.  `payments_with_period_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, we extract `pay_year` (year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (month of `payment_date`).
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_payment_groups"", by=(pay_year, pay_month))`: This groups the records from `payments_with_period_info` based on unique combinations of `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed for each group (i.e., each month).
    *   `payment_year=pay_year`: Selects the year for the current month's group.
    *   `payment_month=pay_month`: Selects the month for the current month's group.
    *   `total_payments_for_month=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments within the current month's group.
    *   `mom_change=(SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount) - PREV(SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount), by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())))`: This calculates the Month-over-Month change.
        *   `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)` provides the total payments for the current month.
        *   `PREV(SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount), by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC()))` retrieves the total payments from the *previous* month. The `by` clause ensures that ""previous"" is determined by chronological order of `pay_year` and `pay_month`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. The `HAS(sales_made) == 1` condition ensures that the `sales_made` sub-collection is not empty for the selected salespersons. This is important to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each salesperson who has made at least one sale:
    *   `salesperson_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `salesperson_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `calculated_asp=(SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP).
        *   `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount for the salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of all their sales (from the `sales_made` sub-collection).
        *   `COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
        *   The division gives the ASP.

3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This takes the result from the previous `CALCULATE` step (which includes salespersons and their ASPs) and selects the top 3 salespersons. The selection is based on `calculated_asp` in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the highest ASP are ranked first.

4.  `.CALCULATE(first_name=salesperson_first_name, last_name=salesperson_last_name, ASP=calculated_asp)`: This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output to include only the requested fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ASP`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start by accessing the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection.

    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection is empty for each car.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers`**: We begin by accessing the `Customers` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`**: This filters the customers.
    *   `car_purchases` is a sub-collection on `Customers` that lists all sales associated with that customer.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: For each customer who has made a purchase, this selects their `_id` field and renames it to `customer_id` in the output. Since `_id` is inherently unique for each customer, the resulting list of `customer_id` values will be distinct.

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection, as we are interested in salesperson IDs.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`**: This is the core filtering logic.
    *   **`sales_made`**: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection, which represents all sales associated with that salesperson.
    *   **`.payment`**: For each sale within `sales_made`, we access its `payment` sub-collection, which represents all payments received for that sale. This effectively gives us a list of all payments linked to a salesperson through their sales.
    *   **`.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`**: We filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
    *   **`HAS(...) == 1`**: The `HAS()` function checks if the preceding expression (filtered cash payments for the salesperson) contains at least one record. If a salesperson has made at least one sale that received a cash payment, this condition will be true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = _id)`**: For each salesperson who satisfies the `WHERE` condition (i.e., has received at least one cash payment):
    *   We create a new record containing a single field named `salesperson_id`.
    *   The value of `salesperson_id` is taken from the `_id` field of the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Since we are filtering the `Salespersons` collection (where each salesperson `_id` is unique) and then selecting their `_id`, the resulting list of `salesperson_id` will be distinct.

1.  Access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  Group the records by `payment_method` using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each `payment_method` group, calculate:
    *   The name of the payment method.

    *   The total sum of `payment_amount` for that method (using `SUM`).
4.  Use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 payment methods based on the total amount received, in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""payment_groups"", by=(payment_method))`: This groups all records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection by the unique values in the `payment_method` field. Each group is named ""payment_groups"" internally for this operation.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `payment_method_name=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` for the current group and names it `payment_method_name`.
    *   `num_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts the total number of payment records within the current `payment_method` group.
    *   `total_payment_sum=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments within the current `payment_method` group.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_payment_sum.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of payment methods with their aggregated counts and sums) and selects the top 3 records. The ordering is determined by `total_payment_sum` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the payment methods with the highest total amounts are ranked first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_car_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car using `car.make` and `car.model`, storing them as temporary fields `car_make_temp` and `car_model_temp`. The `sale_price` is also noted as `current_sale_price`.

2.  `model_sales_summary = sales_with_car_details.PARTITION(...)`: The data is then partitioned (grouped) by the unique combinations of `car_make_temp` and `car_model_temp`. This creates groups for each distinct car model.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (after `PARTITION`): For each group (car model):
    *   `make_val = car_make_temp` and `model_val = car_model_temp`: The make and model for the current group are selected.
    *   `total_revenue_val = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: The total revenue for this model is calculated by summing the `sale_price` of all sales belonging to this specific make/model group. `Sales.sale_price` here refers to the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition.
    *   `total_sales_count_val = COUNT(Sales)`: The total number of sales for this model is determined by counting the number of sales records in the current make/model group.

4.  `top_5_models = model_sales_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue_val.DESC())`: From the summary of all models, we select the top 5 models that have the highest `total_revenue_val`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.

5.  `result = top_5_models.CALCULATE(...)`: Finally, we format the output. The fields `make_val`, `model_val`, `total_sales_count_val`, and `total_revenue_val` (which were carried through by `TOP_K`) are selected and renamed to `make`, `model`, `total_number_of_sales`, and `total_revenue` respectively, to match the requested output structure.",59.11702656745911,"# Step 1: Start with the Sales collection and calculate the make and model for each sale's car.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_context = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step defines two singular date values:
    *   `previous_week_monday`: Calculated as the start of the current week minus 7 days, effectively giving Monday of the previous week.
    *   `current_week_monday`: Calculated as the start of the current week (Monday).
    The time frame for ""previous ISO week"" is thus from `previous_week_monday` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `current_week_monday`.

2.  `payments_in_prev_week = date_context.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_context` (to make `previous_week_monday` and `current_week_monday` available) and filter records where `payment_date` falls within the determined range of the previous ISO week.

3.  `payments_to_group = payments_in_prev_week.CALCULATE(...)`: Before partitioning, we prepare the necessary fields:
    *   `extracted_payment_day`: The `payment_date` is truncated to its day component using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This ensures that all payments on the same calendar day are grouped together.
    *   `extracted_payment_method`: The `payment_method` is selected.
    These fields will serve as keys for the `PARTITION` operation.

4.  `daily_totals_by_method = payments_to_group.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   The `payments_to_group` collection is partitioned using `extracted_payment_day` and `extracted_payment_method` as keys. This creates groups where each group contains payments for a specific day and a specific payment method.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `transaction_date = extracted_payment_day`: The day of the transactions for this group.
        *   `payment_type = extracted_payment_method`: The payment method for this group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_received = SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: The sum of `payment_amount` for all `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into this specific day/method group.

5.  `result = daily_totals_by_method`: The final result contains the daily total amounts, split by payment method, for the entirety of the previous ISO week.",45.163992166519165,"# Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_filtered_and_prepared`: This step starts with the `Sales` collection, filters records for the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`. It then uses `CALCULATE` to make `customer.state` (as `customer_state_field`) and `MONTH(sale_date)` (as `month_of_sale`) available for further processing.
2.  `sales_with_quarter_date`: This step takes the previously prepared data. It carries over `customer_state_field`. A new field, `quarter_first_date`, is calculated using nested `IFF` functions based on `month_of_sale` to represent the first day of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01"" for Q1).
3.  `quarterly_sales_by_state_result`: This is the final step.
    *   It partitions the `sales_with_quarter_date` collection using `PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(customer_state_field, quarter_first_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state and quarter start date.
    *   Within each group, `CALCULATE` is used to define the output fields:
        *   `customer_state`: The state of the customer for the group.
        *   `quarter_representation`: The string representing the first date of the quarter for the group.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales`: This is calculated by `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`. This sums the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group (i.e., for that specific state and quarter). This follows the PyDough pattern of referring to the original collection's field for aggregation within a partition.

1.  Access the `Drugs` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries`: We first establish key date markers using `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`. `current_month_start_dt` is the beginning of the current month, and `three_months_ago_start_dt` is the beginning of the month three months prior to the current month.
2.  `treatments_enhanced`: We access all `Treatments` and augment them. For each treatment, we:
    *   Add a boolean flag `is_biologic` which is `True` if the `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.
    *   Create a `treatment_month_str` (e.g., ""2023-09"") by combining the year and month of the `start_dt`. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
3.  `relevant_month_treatments`: We filter `treatments_enhanced` to include only treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the last three complete months. This means the `start_dt` must be on or after `three_months_ago_start_dt` and before `current_month_start_dt`.
4.  `monthly_patient_counts`:
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_month_treatments` by `treatment_month_str`. This groups all treatments by the month in which they started.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step for each monthly partition:

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines a variable `current_month_start_dt` that holds the timestamp for the very beginning of the current month (e.g., if today is July 15th, 2024, this would be July 1st, 2024, 00:00:00).

3.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
4.  `.CALCULATE(num_treatments_last_six_months = COUNT(treatments_received.WHERE(...)))`: For each patient named Alice:
    *   It accesses their `treatments_received` sub-collection.

        *   And less than `current_month_start_dt` (thereby excluding treatments from the current month).
    *   `COUNT(...)`: It counts the number of treatments that satisfy this date condition.

The aggregation is based on the `start_dt` of treatments, truncated to the month.

PMPD is interpreted as the number of unique patients who received a diagnosis (via a treatment) in a given month.
PMTC is interpreted as the total count of treatments in a given month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Time Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates `current_month_start_val` (the first day of the current month) and `twelve_months_ago_start_val` (the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current month's start). This defines the 12-month period of interest. These are calculated at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level so they can be used downstream.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatments**:
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Treatments are filtered to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the defined 12-month window: `(start_dt >= twelve_months_ago_start_val) & (start_dt < current_month_start_val)`. This correctly excludes the current month.
    *   A `year_month_key` is calculated for each filtered treatment (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting. This key will be used for grouping.
    *   The `patient_id` is aliased to `p_id` to be available for distinct counting after partitioning.

3.  **Partition and Aggregate**:
    *   The `filtered_treatments` collection is then partitioned by `year_month_key`. This groups all treatments by the year and month they started.
    *   For each month-group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `year_month_result`: The year-month string for display.
        *   `PMPD`: Calculated as `NDISTINCT(filtered_treatments.p_id)`, which counts the number of unique patient IDs within the treatments of that specific month.
        *   `PMTC`: Calculated as `COUNT(filtered_treatments)`, which counts the total number of treatments in that specific month.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `year_month_result` in ascending order to display the metrics chronologically.

2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the new patients by the year of their first treatment and count how many unique patients fall into each year.
3.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI is the number of new patients in that year minus the number of new patients in the previous year.

2.  `new_patients_by_year`:
    *   Takes `patient_first_treatment_info`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_groups"", by=first_treatment_year_attr)`: Groups the patients based on the `first_treatment_year_attr`. Each group corresponds to a year.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each year group:
        *   `year_val = first_treatment_year_attr`: Assigns the year value.
        *   `num_new_patients_val = COUNT(Patients)`: Counts the number of unique patients within that year group. This gives the total number of patients whose first treatment occurred in `year_val`.

3.  `ordered_new_patients_by_year`:
    *   `ORDER_BY(year_val.ASC())`: Sorts the yearly new patient counts in ascending order of the year. This is necessary for the `PREV` function to correctly access the previous year's data.

4.  `result`:
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each year:
        *   `year = year_val`: Selects the year.
        *   `number_of_new_patients = num_new_patients_val`: Selects the count of new patients for that year.
        *   `NPI = num_new_patients_val - PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)`: Calculates the New Patients Increase.
            *   `PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)` fetches the `num_new_patients_val` from the previous record (previous year, due to ordering).
            *   If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the dataset), `PREV` returns the `default` value of `0`. In this case, NPI will be `num_new_patients_val - 0`, which is `num_new_patients_val`.

2.  Calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` (`avg_pasi_day7_val`). This average will only include scores from outcomes that meet the non-null condition for *both* timepoints. This is achieved using `KEEP_IF(day7_pasi_score, condition)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  We start calculations from the `DermTreatment` collection, which is the top-level graph access point.
2.  `avg_pasi_day7_val`:
    *   We access the `Outcomes` sub-collection.
    *   For each outcome, we use `CALCULATE` to create a temporary field `score_to_average`.
    *   `KEEP_IF(day7_pasi_score, condition)`: This function returns `day7_pasi_score` if the `condition` is true for that outcome, otherwise it returns null.
    *   The `condition` `(DEFAULT_TO(day7_pasi_score, -1) != -1) & (DEFAULT_TO(day100_pasi_score, -1) != -1)` checks if both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We assume PASI scores are non-negative, making -1 a safe marker for null values.
    *   `AVG(...)` then calculates the average of these `score_to_average` values, automatically ignoring any nulls (i.e., outcomes not meeting the condition).
3.  `avg_pasi_day100_val` is calculated similarly, using `day100_pasi_score` but applying the same condition to ensure it's averaged over the same set of qualifying outcomes.
4.  `d7d100pir_percentage_value`: This line applies the provided formula using the calculated averages for day 7 and day 100, and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.

This query ensures that only outcomes with valid PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100 contribute to the averages, and then computes the D7D100PIR based on these averages. The final result is a single percentage value.",81.13793706893921,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

2. Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Female'.
3. Further filter these female patients to include only those whose `ins_type` indicates private insurance. We'll assume 'Private' is the value representing private insurance.
4. Count the number of patients who meet both criteria.
5. Assign this count to a field named `PIC`.

```python
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    PIC=COUNT(Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private')))
)
```
Explanation:
- We start with the `DermTreatment` graph, which is the entry point to access all collections.
- `CALCULATE(PIC=...)` is used to compute a new field named `PIC`.
- `COUNT(Patients.WHERE(...))` counts the number of patients that satisfy the conditions within the `WHERE` clause.
- `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private'))` filters the `Patients` collection:
    - `gender == 'Female'` selects patients whose gender is 'Female'.
    - `ins_type == 'Private'` selects patients whose insurance type is 'Private'.
    - The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only patients who are female AND have private insurance are counted.",8.366146087646484,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `d_id=drug_id`, `d_name=drug_name`: We select the drug's ID and name, renaming them to avoid conflicts and for clarity.
    *   `num_adverse_events_val=SUM(...)`: This calculates the total number of relevant adverse events for the current drug. The `SUM` function aggregates counts obtained from each treatment associated with this drug.

2.  `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`: Inside the `SUM`, we process each treatment listed in `treatments_used_in` for the current drug.
    *   `count_for_treatment=COUNT(...)`: For each treatment, this calculates the number of its adverse events that meet the specified date condition.

3.  `adverse_events.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `adverse_events` for the current treatment.
    *   `(MONTH(adverse_events.reported_dt) == MONTH(treatments_used_in.start_dt))`: Checks if the month of the adverse event's `reported_dt` is the same as the month of the treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   `(YEAR(adverse_events.reported_dt) == YEAR(treatments_used_in.start_dt))`: Checks if the year of the adverse event's `reported_dt` is the same as the year of the treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   `treatments_used_in.start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` of the parent treatment record currently being processed by the `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE` context.

4.  `.count_for_treatment`: This accesses the result of the inner `COUNT` (i.e., `count_for_treatment`) for each treatment, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM` for the drug.

5.  `drug_adverse_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events_val.DESC())`: After calculating `num_adverse_events_val` for all drugs, this line selects the single drug that has the highest value for `num_adverse_events_val`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

6.  `top_drug_info.CALCULATE(...)`: Finally, this selects the `d_id`, `d_name`, and `num_adverse_events_val` from the top drug record and renames them to the desired output field names: `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events`.",59.073264837265015,"# Calculate, for each drug, the total number of adverse events that were

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1` checks if a doctor has at least one treatment (`prescribed_treatments`) for which the associated drug (`drug`) has a `drug_type` equal to 'Biologic'.

2.  `.CALCULATE(doctor_residence_state=loc_state)`:
    *   For the doctors who meet the criteria, this step calculates a new field named `doctor_residence_state` and assigns it the value of the doctor's `loc_state`. At this point, the collection might contain duplicate states if multiple qualifying doctors are from the same state.

3.  `.PARTITION(name=""distinct_states_group"", by=(doctor_residence_state))`:
    *   This partitions the records based on the `doctor_residence_state`. This grouping is a precursor to selecting distinct states. Each partition (`distinct_states_group`) will represent a unique state.

4.  `.CALCULATE(state=doctor_residence_state)`:
    *   Finally, this selects the `doctor_residence_state` from each partition. Since each partition corresponds to a unique state, this effectively returns a list of distinct states, aliased as `state`.

It also requires the count of distinct patients for these insurance types.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter Relevant Treatments**: It starts by selecting `Treatments` that ended specifically in the year 2022 (`YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`). It also ensures that these treatments have associated outcome records (`HAS(outcome_records) == 1`), which is necessary for calculating PASI scores.
2.  **Prepare for Grouping**: A new field, `ins_type_field`, is created using `CALCULATE`. This field stores the insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) associated with each treatment. This step is crucial because `PARTITION` requires its `by` parameter to be a directly accessible field.
3.  **Group by Insurance Type and Aggregate**: The treatments (now with `ins_type_field`) are partitioned by this insurance type. For each group (i.e., for each insurance type):
    *   `insurance_type`: The insurance type itself is selected.
    *   `average_day_100_pasi_score`: The average of `day100_pasi_score` is calculated. This average is taken over all `day100_pasi_score` values from the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to that specific insurance type group.
    *   `number_of_distinct_patients`: The number of unique patients (`NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`) who received these treatments under that insurance type is counted.
4.  **Select Top 5**: Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=average_day_100_pasi_score.ASC())` is used to select the top 5 insurance types. The sorting is in ascending order of `average_day_100_pasi_score`, meaning those with the lowest average PASI scores are ranked highest.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1)`: This filters the patients.
    *   `treatments_received` is a sub-collection of treatments associated with each patient.
    *   `outcome_records` is a sub-collection of outcomes associated with each treatment.
    *   `treatments_received.outcome_records` refers to all outcome records linked to a patient through their treatments.
    *   `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1` checks if a patient has at least one such outcome record. Only patients for whom this condition is true are kept.
3.  `.CALCULATE(p_patient_id=patient_id, p_first_name=first_name, p_last_name=last_name)`: For each patient who meets the filter criteria, this step selects and renames the required fields:
    *   `p_patient_id=patient_id`: Selects the patient's ID.
    *   `p_first_name=first_name`: Selects the patient's first name.
    *   `p_last_name=last_name`: Selects the patient's last name.
    The renaming (e.g., `p_patient_id`) is a good practice to distinguish calculated/selected fields from original schema fields.

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three main conditions:

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to calculate a single aggregate value.
2.  `num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(...)`: We are defining a new field `num_qualifying_treatments` that will hold the count of treatments meeting the criteria.
3.  `Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  The conditions inside `WHERE` are combined using the logical AND operator (`&`):
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This checks if the lowercase version of the `diag_name` (from the linked `diagnosis` record) contains ""psoriasis"". The `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This checks if the linked `drug` record has an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), implying the drug is FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment has an `end_dt` before attempting date comparisons.
    *   `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: This checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`: This checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or before the current moment. Together, these two date conditions ensure the `end_dt` falls within the last 6 months.
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `Treatments` records that satisfy all the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause.",37.41604161262512,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  Start with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments to include only those where `is_placebo` is true and that have at least one entry in their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection (using `HAS(concomitant_meds) == 1`).
3.  Access the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for these filtered treatments.
4.  Filter these concomitant medications based on their `start_dt`. The condition is that the medication must have started on or after the treatment's `start_dt` and no later than 14 days after the treatment's `start_dt`. This is expressed using `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` which should be between 0 and 14, inclusive.
5.  Use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields:
    *   `treatment_id` from the parent `Treatments` record.
    *   `start_dt` from the parent `Treatments` record.
    *   `end_dt` from the parent `Treatments` record.
    *   `start_dt` from the `ConcomitantMeds` record.
    *   `end_dt` from the `ConcomitantMeds` record.

The field `treatment.start_dt` (and other `treatment.*` fields) inside the `WHERE` and `CALCULATE` clauses applied to `concomitant_meds` refers to the fields of the parent `Treatments` record from which the `concomitant_meds` are being accessed.

```python
# First, filter the Treatments to get placebo treatments that have concomitant medications.
selected_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (is_placebo == True) & (HAS(concomitant_meds) == 1)

1.  `selected_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: It filters the `Treatments` collection to find records where `is_placebo` is true and there is at least one associated concomitant medication (`HAS(concomitant_meds) == 1`).
2.  `result = selected_treatments.concomitant_meds.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   It then iterates over the `concomitant_meds` for each of the `selected_treatments`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications:
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date. `treatment.start_dt` refers to the start date of the parent treatment.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started no more than 14 days after the treatment's start date.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then selects the required information:
        *   `treatment_id_val = treatment.treatment_id`: The ID of the parent treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_dt_val = treatment.start_dt`: The start date of the parent treatment.

1.  Iterate through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify all transactions they received (`transactions_received`).
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those with a `status` of `""successful""`.
4.  From these successful transactions, count the number of distinct `coupon_id`s used. This requires ensuring that we only count actual coupon IDs, so we filter for transactions where `coupon_id` is not an empty string.
5.  Count the total number of distinct successful transactions for the merchant.
6.  Calculate CPUR as `(number of distinct coupons used * 1.0) / number of distinct successful transactions`. Multiplying by `1.0` ensures floating-point division.
7.  If a merchant has no successful transactions, their CPUR should be `0.0` to avoid division by zero.
8.  The final result should include the merchant's `name` and the calculated `CPUR`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation for each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
*   `merchant_name=name`: This selects the `name` of the merchant and assigns it to the `merchant_name` field in the output.
*   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR using the `IFF` function for conditional logic.
    *   `IFF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`
*   `COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")) > 0`: This is the condition for the `IFF` function. It checks if the merchant has any successful transactions.
    *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is ""successful"".

1.  **Establish Current Week Reference**: We first define `current_week_start_ts` at the `Ewallet` (top-level graph) context. This gives us a fixed timestamp for the beginning of the current week, which will be used to calculate week differences.
2.  **Filter Users and Process Notifications**:
    *   We select `Users` whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""CA"".
    *   For these users, we access their `notifications`.
    *   For each notification, we calculate:
        *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The date of the start of the week in which the notification's `created_at` timestamp falls. This is achieved using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`, fulfilling the requirement to truncate `created_at` to the week for aggregation.
        *   `is_weekend_flag`: A numeric flag (1 if the notification was created on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", 0 otherwise). This is determined using `DAYNAME(created_at)`.
        *   `weeks_diff`: The difference in full weeks between the `notification_actual_week_start` and the `current_week_start_ts`. `DATEDIFF(""weeks"", ..., ...)` is used for this.
    *   We then filter these processed notifications to keep only those where `weeks_diff` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the last week, the week before last, and two weeks before last, effectively covering the ""last 3 weeks excluding the current week"".
3.  **Aggregate per Week**:
    *   The filtered notifications (`user_notifications_info`) are then partitioned by `notification_actual_week_start`. This groups all relevant notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each of the three weeks):
        *   We output `week_start_display` (which is the `notification_actual_week_start` partition key).
        *   `total_notifications_sent`: We count the total number of `Notifications` in this group using `COUNT(Notifications)`.
        *   `weekend_notifications_sent`: We sum the `is_weekend_flag` for all notifications in this group. Since the flag is 1 for weekend notifications and 0 for others, this sum gives the total count of notifications sent on weekends for that week.

    *   `status == ""active""`: Ensures that only merchants with an 'active' status are considered.
    *   `LOWER(category) == ""retail""`: Filters for merchants whose category is 'retail'. The `LOWER` function is used on the `category` field to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.
    *   `HAS(coupons) == 1`: Ensures that only merchants who have issued at least one coupon are included. `HAS(coupons)` returns true if the `coupons` sub-collection for a merchant is not empty.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this function is used to select and compute the desired output fields for each merchant.

1.  **Identify Relevant Balances**: Filter the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` falls within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` for this. `DATETIME('now')` provides the current timestamp.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: The definition provided is ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". This means for each user who had balance updates in the specified period, we need to calculate their average balance from those updates. We achieve this by:
    *   Partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id`.
    *   For each user's partition, calculating `AVG(UserBalances.balance)`. This gives the AMB for that specific user.
3.  **Calculate the Average of AMBs**: The final step is to compute the average of all the per-user AMBs calculated in the previous step. This will give the overall average AMB.

The query is structured as follows:
*   First, `UserBalances` are filtered by `updated_at`.
*   Then, these filtered balances are partitioned by `user_id`.
*   Within each partition (i.e., for each user), their average balance (`amb_for_single_user`) is calculated.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, access their `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserBalances` records).
3.  Within each user's `balances`, identify the most recent balance record. This can be achieved by ranking the balance records by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order and selecting the one with rank 1. The `RANKING` function with `per=""Users""` will handle this for each user individually.
4.  Use `SINGULAR()` to convert the single latest balance record (per user) into a singular context, allowing direct field access.
5.  Extract the `balance` value from this latest record.
6.  The final result will include user identifiers (like `uid` and `username`) and their LUB. If a user has no balance records, the LUB is expected to be null.

    *   `revenue_amount=DEFAULT_TO(revenue_amount_calc, 0.0)`: This sets the `revenue_amount` for the final output. If `revenue_amount_calc` is null (which might happen if a merchant has no transactions meeting the criteria, and `SUM` over an empty set is null), it defaults to `0.0`. This ensures all merchants get a numeric revenue value.

        *   `by=DEFAULT_TO(revenue_amount_calc, 0.0).DESC()`: Merchants are ranked based on their `revenue_amount_calc` (defaulted to `0.0` if null). `.DESC()` ensures that the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",Ewallet,"The query calculates the Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) for wallet transactions over the last two months, excluding the current month. PMDAU is defined as the count of distinct senders who made a transaction with `sender_type = 0` within each month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates the start and end dates for the period of interest.
    *   `period_start_date_val` is set to the first day of the month, two months prior to the current month (e.g., if today is July 15th, this will be May 1st).
    *   `period_end_date_val` is set to the first day of the current month (e.g., July 1st).
    *   This defines a period covering the entirety of the two full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   It accesses `Ewallet.Transactions`.
    *   Transactions are filtered to include only those where `created_at` falls within `[period_start_date_val, period_end_date_val)`.
    *   A further filter `sender_type == 0` is applied as per the PMDAU definition.

3.  **Prepare Data for Aggregation**:
    *   For each filtered transaction, a `year_month_label` is created by formatting the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of `created_at` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (e.g., ""2023-05""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
    *   The `sender_id` is selected as `sender_unique_id`.

4.  **Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   The `transaction_details_for_pmdau` collection is then partitioned by `year_month_label`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   Within each monthly partition (`monthly_group`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_month_str`: The year-month label for the group.
        *   `pmdau_value`: The number of distinct `sender_unique_id` values within that month's transactions. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(transaction_details_for_pmdau.sender_unique_id)`.

5.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered chronologically by `transaction_month_str`.

The final output will be a list of months (as ""YYYY-MM"") and their corresponding PMDAU counts.

1.  Filter the `UserSessions` collection to include only sessions that started on or after ""2023-06-01"" and before ""2023-06-08"".
2.  For these filtered sessions, calculate two pieces of information:
    *   The `user_id` associated with the session, which we'll name `session_user_id`.
    *   The duration of each session in seconds, calculated using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We'll name this `duration_per_session_seconds`.
    This intermediate result (`sessions_info`) will be a collection where each row represents a single session with its user ID and its duration in seconds.
3.  Partition the `sessions_info` collection by `session_user_id`. This groups all sessions belonging to the same user.
4.  For each group (i.e., for each user), calculate:
    *   The `user_id` (from the partition key `session_user_id`).
    *   The sum of `duration_per_session_seconds` from the `sessions_info` records within that group. This gives the total session duration for that user, which we'll name `total_session_duration_seconds`.
5.  Finally, sort these aggregated results by `total_session_duration_seconds` in descending order, so users with the longest total session duration appear first.

The `DATEDIFF` function will return the duration in seconds as an integer, and the `SUM` of these integers will also be an integer, satisfying the output requirements.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`one_month_ago_timestamp = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`**: This line defines the start of our period. It calculates the timestamp for exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`).
2.  **`current_timestamp = DATETIME('now')`**: This line defines the end of our period, which is the current timestamp.

1.  **Determine the date range for the ""previous month""**:
    *   The start of the current month is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   The first day of the previous month is one month before the start of the current month: `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-1 month')`.
    *   The previous month ends just before the start of the current month. So, transactions will be filtered for `created_at >= first_day_of_previous_month` and `created_at < start_of_current_month`.

2.  **Filter transactions**: Select transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated date range.

3.  **Identify successful transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is `""completed""`. This is a common convention.

4.  **Count transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (status is ""completed"") in the previous month.

5.  **Calculate STR**: According to the definition provided, STR = (number of successful transactions / total number of transactions). We will express this as a percentage. If there are no transactions in the previous month, STR will be 0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month_val` and `first_day_prev_month_val` are contextless expressions that define the date boundaries for the previous month.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gets the first moment of the current month.
    *   `DATETIME(start_of_current_month_val, '-1 month')` subtracts one month to get the first moment of the previous month.
2.  `transactions_in_prev_month` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions where `created_at` falls within the previous month. The range is inclusive of the start of the previous month and exclusive of the start of the current month.
3.  `num_successful_transactions` counts the filtered transactions from the previous month where the `status` is `""completed""`. This assumes `""completed""` signifies a successful transaction.
4.  `num_total_transactions` counts all filtered transactions from the previous month.
5.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE` brings these counts into a single-row collection. `Ewallet` is used as it's a global calculation.
6.  The second `Ewallet.CALCULATE` computes `calculated_str` using the formula for STR: `(successful_tx_count / total_tx_count) * 100.0`. The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_tx_count` is zero to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` for STR in such cases.

1.  First, for each merchant, we determine their creation year and month using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions on the `created_at` field. We also select the merchant's `mid` and `name`.
2.  Then, for each merchant, we count the number of coupons (`coupons` sub-collection) that were also created in the *same year and month* as the merchant. This is done by filtering the `coupons` based on their `created_at` field, comparing its year and month with the merchant's creation year and month.
3.  After calculating this count for all merchants, we use `TOP_K(1, by=count.DESC())` to find the merchant with the highest number of such coupons.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_creation_info`: This step processes the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, it calculates `m_creation_year` and `m_creation_month` from their `created_at` timestamp. It also carries forward `mid` (as `merchant_mid`) and `name` (as `merchant_name`).
2.  `merchants_with_coupon_counts`: This step takes the output of the previous step. For each merchant, it counts their associated `coupons`. The `WHERE` clause inside the `COUNT` function filters these coupons to include only those whose `created_at` year and month match the `m_creation_year` and `m_creation_month` of the merchant (calculated in the previous step). The result is `num_coupons_in_creation_month`.
3.  `top_merchant_by_coupons`: This step applies `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` to the collection of merchants with their respective coupon counts. It selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` formats the output from `top_merchant_by_coupons` to return only the merchant's `mid`, `name`, and the `num_coupons` (renamed from `num_coupons_in_creation_month`).",29.8890233039856,"# Calculate the creation year and month for each merchant

    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition checks if a user has at least one notification that satisfies the nested `WHERE` clause.
        *   `notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`: This filters the `notifications` sub-collection for each user to find notifications that are both 'promotional' by `notification_type` and 'unread' by `status`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this function is applied to each user who met the criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_for_analysis = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.

    *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Filters for transactions where the sender was a user, excluding merchants.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successful transactions.
    *   `sending_user.status == ""active""`: Ensures that the user who sent the money was active at the time (assuming `status` reflects current user status, which is typical).
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month_as_date = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month'))`: For each filtered transaction, this calculates a new field `transaction_month_as_date`, which represents the first day of the month in which the transaction occurred. This field is used for grouping.

2.  `result = transactions_for_analysis.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `transactions_for_analysis` data and partitions it.
    *   `name=""user_sends_per_month""`: Assigns a name to the conceptual groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(transaction_month_as_date)`: Groups the transactions based on the `transaction_month_as_date` field, so all transactions from the same month fall into the same group.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After partitioning, this calculates the final output for each group (i.e., for each month).
    *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_as_date`: Selects the month (which was the partition key) for the output. This will be the first day of the month.
    *   `num_active_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: For each month's group of transactions, this counts the number of unique `uid` values from the `sending_user`. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.

For these top countries, we need to return the country name, the number of distinct users who sent transactions from that country, and the total transaction amount sent from that country.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Transactions**: We start with the `Transactions` collection and filter for transactions where `sender_type == 0`. This ensures we are only considering transactions sent by users.
2.  **Prepare for Partitioning**: We then use `CALCULATE` to create a field, `grouping_country`, which will be `sending_user.country`. This field will be used as the key for partitioning. The original transaction fields like `amount` and the `sending_user` (with their `uid`) remain accessible from this intermediate collection.
3.  **Partition by Country**: We partition the data from the previous step by `grouping_country`. This groups all transactions by the country of the sending user.
4.  **Aggregate Data per Country**: For each country group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select the `country` (which is our `grouping_country` partition key).
    *   Calculate `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent` using `NDISTINCT` on the `uid` of the `sending_user` for the transactions within that country group.
    *   Calculate `total_transaction_amount` using `SUM` on the `amount` of the transactions within that country group.
5.  **Select Top 5 Countries**: Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to get the top 5 countries based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order. The result will include the `country`, `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent`, and `total_transaction_amount` for these top 5 countries.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_relevant_tx_info = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by iterating through each record in the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `merchant_name_val = name`: We store the merchant's `name` in a temporary variable `merchant_name_val`.
    *   `recent_typed_transactions = transactions_received.WHERE(...)`: For each merchant, we access their `transactions_received`. We then filter these transactions:
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150`: This condition ensures that only transactions created within the last 150 days (inclusive of 150 days ago from the current time) are considered. `DATETIME('now')` provides the current timestamp.
        *   `receiver_type == 1`: This condition filters for transactions where the `receiver_type` field on the transaction itself is 1, as specified in the request.
    *   The result of this step is a collection where each record represents a merchant, now augmented with `merchant_name_val` and a (potentially empty) sub-collection `recent_typed_transactions` containing their qualifying transactions.

2.  `merchant_aggregates = merchants_with_relevant_tx_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We take the output from the previous step.
    *   `m_name_out = merchant_name_val`: We carry forward the merchant's name.
    *   `total_amount_calc = SUM(recent_typed_transactions.amount)`: We calculate the sum of the `amount` for all transactions in the `recent_typed_transactions` sub-collection for each merchant. This gives the total transaction amount received by the merchant under the specified conditions.
    *   `num_transactions_calc = COUNT(recent_typed_transactions)`: We count the number of transactions in the `recent_typed_transactions` sub-collection. This gives the total number of qualifying transactions.

3.  `top_2_merchants_by_amount = merchant_aggregates.WHERE(...).TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:

```
**Explanation:**

1.  The outer `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)` defines three variables: `ref_year`, `ref_month`, and `ref_day`. These capture the year, month, and day of the current date and time, respectively, using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`, `MONTH(DATETIME('now'))`, and `DAY(DATETIME('now'))`. These variables are then available for use in subsequent operations.
2.  The inner `CALCULATE(...)` computes the `median_merchant_balance`.
3.  Inside the `MEDIAN(...)` function:
    *   `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection.
        *   `status == ""active""`: Selects merchants whose status is ""active"".
        *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(category), ""retail"")`: Selects merchants whose category contains ""retail"". `LOWER(category)` ensures the check is case-insensitive.
    *   `.balances.WHERE(...)`: For the filtered merchants, this accesses their associated `balances` (which are `MerchantBalances` records) and filters them further.
        *   `(YEAR(updated_at) == ref_year) & (MONTH(updated_at) == ref_month) & (DAY(updated_at) == ref_day)`: This condition ensures that only balances updated on the current date (matching `ref_year`, `ref_month`, and `ref_day` from the outer `CALCULATE`) are included.
    *   `.balance`: From the final filtered set of `MerchantBalances` records, this accesses the `balance` attribute.
4.  `MEDIAN(...)`: This aggregation function then calculates the median of all these selected `balance` values. If no balances meet the criteria, the median would typically be null (as per the cheat sheet: ""absent records are ignored when deriving the median"").

Explanation:
-   `UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only records where the year of `snapshot_date` is 2023.
-   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1)`: This further filters the 2023 snapshots. `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)` assigns a rank to each snapshot based on its `snapshot_date` (earliest date gets rank 1). `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest date, they all receive rank 1. The `WHERE(... == 1)` clause selects only these earliest snapshots.
-   `.CALCULATE(average_tx_limit_daily = AVG(tx_limit_daily), average_tx_limit_monthly = AVG(tx_limit_monthly))`: This takes the collection of earliest snapshots from 2023 and calculates two aggregate values:
    -   `average_tx_limit_daily`: The average of the `tx_limit_daily` field across all selected earliest snapshots.
    -   `average_tx_limit_monthly`: The average of the `tx_limit_monthly` field across all selected earliest snapshots.
The final `result` will be a single-row collection containing these two average values.",40.46345496177673,"result = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To find the average user session duration in seconds, split by device_type, we can follow these steps:

1.  **Calculate Session Duration**: For each session in the `UserSessions` collection, calculate its duration in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts`. We'll store this in a new field, for example, `duration_in_seconds`. The original `device_type` field from `UserSessions` will also be available.
2.  **Partition by Device Type**: Group the sessions based on their `device_type`. The `PARTITION` function is suitable for this, using `device_type` as the partitioning key.
3.  **Calculate Average Duration**: For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the `duration_in_seconds` values.
4.  **Select Output Fields**: The final output should include the `device_type` and the calculated average session duration.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds.
# This creates an intermediate collection 'sessions_with_duration' which contains
# the original 'device_type' field from UserSessions and the newly calculated 'duration_in_seconds'.
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    duration_in_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)
)

# Step 2: Partition the 'sessions_with_duration' collection by 'device_type'.
# Then, for each device_type group, calculate the average of the 'duration_in_seconds'.
# The 'device_type' in the final CALCULATE refers to the partition key.
# 'sessions_with_duration.duration_in_seconds' refers to the 'duration_in_seconds' field
# from the records within each partition of the 'sessions_with_duration' collection.

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to derive a new field `duration_in_seconds` for each session.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` calculates the difference between the session end and start timestamps in seconds.
    *   The resulting collection, `sessions_with_duration`, contains all original fields from `UserSessions` (including `device_type`) plus the new `duration_in_seconds` field.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""sessions_grouped_by_device"", by=(device_type))`: This partitions the `sessions_with_duration` collection into groups based on the unique values of the `device_type` field.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type=device_type, avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_in_seconds))`: This operation is performed on each partition (each group of `device_type`).
        *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` (which is the partition key).
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_in_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_in_seconds` field for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. The `AVG` function aggregates these values.

The final `result` will be a collection where each record contains a `device_type` and its corresponding `avg_session_duration_seconds`.",57.939044713974,"# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter out merchants who do not have any coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  In a `CALCULATE` step, we determine the earliest coupon for each merchant. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the merchant's `coupons` sub-collection.
    *   Using `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1` to find the coupon(s) with the earliest `start_date` for that specific merchant. The `per=""Merchants""` ensures the ranking is performed independently for each merchant.
    *   Applying `.SINGULAR()` to pick one such coupon record if there are multiple earliest coupons with the same start date, or to ensure the result is a single record. This record is stored as `earliest_coupon_record`.
    *   We also store the merchant's `mid` as `m_id` and `created_at` (registration date) as `m_registration_date`.
4.  A second `CALCULATE` step is used to extract the `cid` and `start_date` from the `earliest_coupon_record` obtained in the previous step, along with the merchant's details. These are stored as `merchant_mid_out`, `merchant_reg_date_out`, `coupon_cid_out`, and `coupon_start_date_out`. This is necessary because attributes defined in a `CALCULATE` are not immediately available in the same `CALCULATE` block for further operations.
5.  Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these merchants based on the condition that the earliest coupon's start date (`coupon_start_date_out`) is:
    *   On or after the merchant's registration date (`merchant_reg_date_out`).
    *   Within one year of the merchant's registration date. This is checked by ensuring `coupon_start_date_out` is less than or equal to the registration date plus one year, calculated using `DATETIME(merchant_reg_date_out, '1 year')`.
