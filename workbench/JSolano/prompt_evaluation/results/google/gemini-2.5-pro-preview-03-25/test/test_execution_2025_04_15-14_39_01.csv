**1. Analysis of the Request:**

*   **Goal:** Count total and weekend payments for expensive sales ($>30k) over the last 8 full weeks.
*   **Data Needed:** Sales (`sale_price`), PaymentsReceived (`payment_date`).
*   **Filtering:**
    *   `Sales.sale_price > 30000`
    *   `PaymentsReceived.payment_date` within the last 8 full weeks (excluding the current week).
*   **Calculations:**
    *   Determine the start date of each payment's week.
    *   Identify if a payment occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).
    *   Count total payments per week.
    *   Count weekend payments per week.
*   **Grouping:** Group by the calculated week start date.
*   **Ordering:** Sort by week start date ascending.
*   **Output:** Week start date, total payments count, weekend payments count.

**2. Function Selection & Justification:**

*   `WHERE`: To filter `Sales` by `sale_price` and `PaymentsReceived` by `payment_date`.
*   `DATETIME`: To get the current date (`'now'`) and perform date arithmetic to define the 8-week window. **Assumption:** We'll assume `DATETIME` supports a `'start of week'` modifier to find the Monday of a given date and supports interval subtraction like `'-56 days'`.
*   `DAYOFWEEK`: **Assumption:** We need a function to determine the day of the week (e.g., returning 1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday) to identify weekends. This function is not explicitly listed in the cheat sheet, so we assume its existence for this solution.
*   `ISIN`: To check if the `DAYOFWEEK` result corresponds to Saturday (6) or Sunday (7).
*   `CALCULATE`: To compute the `payment_week_start` date and the `is_weekend_payment` flag for each relevant payment.
*   `PARTITION`: To group the processed payments by their `payment_week_start` date.
*   `COUNT`: To count the total number of payments within each week's partition.
*   `SUM`: To sum the `is_weekend_payment` flag (treating True as 1, False as 0) within each week's partition to get the weekend payment count.
*   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final weekly results chronologically.

**3. Partitioning Strategy:**

*   Partitioning is necessary to group payments by week.
*   We will partition the `PaymentsReceived` data (after filtering and initial calculation) by the calculated `payment_week_start` date. This is appropriate as it's the grouping key required by the request.

**4. Code Generation:**

final_result = weekly_payment_summary.ORDER_BY(week_date.ASC())

```

**5. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  **Date Setup:** Calculate the start (`start_date_inclusive`) and end (`end_date_exclusive`) dates for the 8-week period preceding the current week, assuming Monday as the week start. This uses assumed `DATETIME` capabilities.
2.  **Filter Sales:** Select records from the `Sales` collection where the `sale_price` is greater than 30,000.
3.  **Filter & Process Payments:**
    *   Access the `payment` sub-collection (linking to `PaymentsReceived`) for the filtered `high_value_sales`.
    *   Filter these payments to include only those where `payment_date` falls within the calculated 8-week window (`>= start_date_inclusive` and `< end_date_exclusive`).
    *   For each filtered payment, calculate `payment_week_start` (the date of the Monday of that week, assuming `DATETIME(..., 'start of week')`) and `is_weekend_payment` (a boolean/integer flag indicating if the payment date was a Saturday or Sunday, assuming `DAYOFWEEK` and `ISIN`).
4.  **Partition & Aggregate:**
    *   Group the `payments_in_period` using `PARTITION`. The grouping key (`by`) is the calculated `payment_week_start`. Each group (`week_payments_group`) contains all payments from the same calendar week within the target period.
    *   For each group (week), calculate:
        *   `week_date`: The start date of the week (taken directly from the partition key `payment_week_start`).
        *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments in that week's group using `COUNT(week_payments_group)`.
        *   `weekend_payments_received`: The count of weekend payments by summing the `is_weekend_payment` flag for all payments in the group using `SUM(week_payments_group.is_weekend_payment)`.
5.  **Order Results:** Sort the resulting weekly summaries in ascending order based on the `week_date`.
6.  **Assign Final Result:** The final ordered summary is assigned to the `final_result` variable.","# Define date boundaries for the last 8 full calendar weeks

The output should include the make, model, and the sales count. Case-insensitive and partial matching are required for the VIN number.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification:**
    *   `Cars`: To access the car data.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter cars based on the VIN number.
    *   `LIKE`: To perform partial string matching on the VIN number.
    *   `LOWER`: To ensure case-insensitive matching for the VIN number.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy:** `PARTITION` is necessary here to group the cars by `make` and `model` after filtering. This allows us to count sales specifically for each unique make/model combination that meets the VIN criteria. Partitioning by `make` and `model` is appropriate as these define the grouping level required by the request.

4.  **Ranking Considerations:** `RANKING` is not required for this query.

5.  **Handling Ambiguity:** The request is clear.

7.  **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    *   `filtered_m5_cars = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`: This line filters the `Cars` collection. It converts the `vin_number` to lowercase using `LOWER` and then uses `LIKE` with the pattern `'%m5%'` to find cars whose VIN contains 'm5' anywhere within the string, regardless of case.
    *   `PARTITION(filtered_m5_cars, name='car_model_group', by=(make, model))`: This takes the `filtered_m5_cars` and groups them based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group is accessible via the name `car_model_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(car_model_group.sale_records))`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`, this calculates the final output.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Sales`: This is the primary collection containing sale records, including `sale_date`, `sale_price`, and a link to the `car`.
    *   `WHERE`: Needed to filter sales based on two criteria: the car's make (`car.make == 'Toyota'`) and the sale date (`sale_date` within the last 30 days).
    *   `DATETIME`: Required to determine the start date of the 30-day period. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day', '-29 days')` calculates the date 29 days prior to the beginning of the current day, effectively setting the start of the 30-day window inclusive of today.
    *   `GRAPH.CALCULATE`: Used to perform aggregations across the filtered set of sales records to get the final count and sum.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of filtered sales records.
    *   `SUM`: To sum the `sale_price` of the filtered sales records.

        *   `num_sales`: Counts the total number of sales records linked to the salesperson via `sales_made`.
        *   `sales_rank`: Calculates the rank of each salesperson based on their total sales amount (`SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`). The `.DESC()` ensures that higher sales amounts get lower rank numbers (e.g., rank 1 for the highest). The ranking is performed across all salespersons.
    3.  The second `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields for the final output: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, `number_of_sales`, and `SR` (Sales Rank). This step ensures only the requested fields are returned with the specified names.",,Unknown,

1.  **Goal:** Find the highest sale price for each car make/model combination, considering only cars that have been sold and are confirmed to be out of inventory based on their most recent inventory snapshot. Order the results by this highest price.

    *   `RANKING`: To identify the single most recent (`snapshot_date`) inventory record for each car (`levels=1`). `allow_ties=True` is used, although for a single latest date, ties are unlikely but handled.
    *   `SINGULAR`: To treat the result of the ranked snapshot filter as a single record, allowing access to its `is_in_inventory` field.
    *   `DEFAULT_TO`: To handle cars with no inventory snapshots. If `latest_snapshot.is_in_inventory` is null (no snapshot found), we default the status to `True` (in inventory), ensuring these cars are excluded.
    *   `Cars.WHERE`: To filter the cars based on the calculated fields: must have sales (`has_sales == True`) and must not be in inventory (`is_not_in_inventory == True`). We also add `PRESENT(max_sale_price_for_car)` for robustness.

6.  **Explanation:**
    *   The code first processes each car in the `Cars` collection. It calculates whether the car has sales records (`has_sales`), finds its single latest inventory snapshot (`latest_snapshot`) using `RANKING`, and determines the maximum sale price recorded for that specific car (`max_sale_price_for_car`).
    *   A second `CALCULATE` uses the `latest_snapshot` to determine if the car's latest status is *not* in inventory (`is_not_in_inventory`). It defaults to considering the car *in* inventory if no snapshot is found.
    *   The code then filters these cars, keeping only those that `have_sales`, are `is_not_in_inventory`, and have a non-null `max_sale_price_for_car`.
    *   Next, it partitions these filtered cars into groups based on their `make` and `model`.
    *   Within each `make`/`model` group (`car_group`), it calculates the overall `highest_sale_price` by taking the maximum of the `max_sale_price_for_car` values from all cars in that group.
    *   Finally, it orders these make/model groups based on their `highest_sale_price` from highest to lowest and selects only the `make`, `model`, and `highest_sale_price` for the output.","# Step 1: CALCULATE necessary fields for each car

1.  **`DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`**: To get the start date of the current month.
2.  **`DATETIME(..., '-6 months')`**: To calculate the start date of the 6-month period before the current month.
3.  **`WHERE`**: To filter `Salespersons` based on their `hire_date` and to filter `Sales` based on the `sale_date` falling within the calculated 6-month window.
4.  **`YEAR`**: To extract the year from the `hire_date` for filtering.
5.  **`CALCULATE`**: To prepare the data for partitioning by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of the month (`sale_month`) and selecting the `sale_price`.
6.  **`PARTITION`**: To group the filtered sales data by the calculated `sale_month`.

8.  **`SUM`**: To calculate the Per Month Sales Revenue (PMSR) within each monthly partition.
9.  **`ORDER_BY`**: To sort the final results by month in ascending order.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is necessary to group the sales data by month. The partitioning key will be `sale_month`, derived by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month using `DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month')`. This allows aggregation of sales count and revenue for each month within the specified period.

**Note on Zero Months:**

The standard PyDough `PARTITION` function groups existing data. If a specific month within the last 6 months had zero sales from the eligible salespersons, that month will not appear in the result set generated by this query. Fulfilling the requirement to show *all* months in the range, including those with zero metrics, typically requires features like date dimension tables and outer joins, which are not standard features described in the provided PyDough reference. The following code provides results only for months with actual sales data meeting the criteria.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month
current_month_start_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
six_months_ago_start_date = DATETIME(current_month_start_date, '-6 months')

# Filter salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive)
eligible_salespersons = Salespersons.WHERE(
    (YEAR(hire_date) >= 2022) & (YEAR(hire_date) <= 2023)
)

# Access sales made by these salespersons, filter by the date range,
# and calculate the sale month and select sale price
sales_in_period = eligible_salespersons.sales_made.WHERE(
    (sale_date >= six_months_ago_start_date) & (sale_date < current_month_start_date)

    sale_month=DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month'),

    month=sale_month,
    PMSPS=COUNT(monthly_sales_group),
    PMSR=SUM(monthly_sales_group.sale_price)
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**: `current_month_start_date` captures the first day of the current month. `six_months_ago_start_date` calculates the date 6 months prior to the start of the current month. The period of interest is `>= six_months_ago_start_date` and `< current_month_start_date`.
2.  **Filter Salespersons**: `eligible_salespersons` selects only those salespersons whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023.
3.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data**: It accesses the `sales_made` by the `eligible_salespersons`. Then, it filters these sales to include only those with a `sale_date` within the defined 6-month window. Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month` field (by truncating `sale_date` to the start of the month) and selects the `sale_price`.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: `PARTITION` groups the `sales_in_period` data by `sale_month`. For each month (`monthly_sales_group`), it calculates:
    *   `month`: The month identifier (start date of the month).
    *   `PMSPS`: The count of sales records within that month's group using `COUNT(monthly_sales_group)`.
    *   `PMSR`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that month's group using `SUM(monthly_sales_group.sale_price)`.
5.  **Order Results**: The final result is ordered by the `month` in ascending order using `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`.","# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current MONTH

    3.  `total_revenue_2023=SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales found in `sales_in_2023`, representing the total revenue.
    4.  `total_cost_2023=SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`: It calculates the sum of the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale in `sales_in_2023`, representing the total cost of goods sold.
    5.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=IFF(...))`: This second `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed totals (`total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`) to calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
    6.  `IFF(total_cost_2023 != 0, ..., None)`: This checks if `total_cost_2023` is not zero to prevent division by zero errors. If it's not zero, it calculates GPM using the formula `(revenue - cost) / cost * 100.0`. If the cost is zero, it returns `None` (you might adjust this based on specific requirements). Using `100.0` ensures the result is a float.

    *   `CALCULATE`: To extract the year and month from the `payment_date` column in the `PaymentsReceived` collection and to select the `payment_amount`.

    *   `PARTITION`: To group the payment records by the extracted year and month.
    *   `SUM`: An aggregation function used within the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` to sum the `payment_amount` for each year/month group.
    *   `ORDER_BY`: To sort the final results chronologically by year and then by month.
    *   **MoM Calculation Limitation**: Calculating the month-over-month (MoM) change requires accessing the previous month's total (`LAG` function in SQL). Based on the provided PyDough reference, there isn't a direct equivalent function to access data from a previous row in an ordered sequence. Therefore, calculating the MoM change within this single PyDough query is not feasible with the documented functions. The query will focus on calculating the total payments per month. Similarly, generating rows for months with zero payments requires a calendar generation mechanism, which is not explicitly available in the provided PyDough reference. The query will return totals only for months with existing payment data.

2.  **Partitioning Strategy**
    *   Partitioning is necessary to group payments based on the time period (year and month).

*   **Ranking Considerations**:
    *   `TOP_K` is used instead of `RANKING` as we need the top N records directly, not their rank number.

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and calculates three fields for each salesperson:

1.  **Analyze the Input**: The goal is to identify cars from the `Cars` collection that do not have any corresponding entries in the `Sales` collection, indicating they haven't been sold. We need to return the `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year` for these cars. The request mentions a ""left join"" concept, which in PyDough translates to checking for the absence of related records in a sub-collection.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Cars`: This is the primary collection we need to query.
    *   `WHERE`: This function is needed to filter the cars based on the condition that they have no sales records.
    *   `HASNOT`: This aggregation function is ideal for checking if a sub-collection (in this case, `sale_records`) is empty. `HASNOT(sale_records)` will evaluate to true for cars with no sales.
    *   `CALCULATE`: This function is used to select and potentially rename the specific fields required in the output (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`).

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not necessary for this query as we are applying a simple filter directly to the `Cars` collection.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not needed as we are not ordering or selecting top/bottom records based on any criteria.

*   **Explanation**:
    1.  `Customers`: Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    2.  `.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`: Filters this collection to include only customers for whom the `car_purchases` sub-collection (linking to the `Sales` collection) contains at least one record. The `HAS()` function returns true if the sub-collection is not empty, and we explicitly compare it to `1` (True).
    3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_identifier=_id)`: Selects only the `_id` field from the filtered customers and renames it to `customer_identifier`. Since `_id` is unique for each customer, the resulting list of IDs will be distinct.","# Filter customers who have at least one entry in their 'car_purchases' list

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to find the unique IDs (`_id`) of salespersons who were involved in a sale for which a 'Cash' payment was received. This involves linking `Salespersons`, `Sales`, and `PaymentsReceived`.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Salespersons`: This is our starting point, as we want salesperson IDs.
    *   `.sales_made`: This sub-collection links `Salespersons` to the `Sales` they made.
    *   `.payment`: This sub-collection links `Sales` to the `PaymentsReceived` for that sale.
    *   `.WHERE()`: We need this twice. First, to filter `PaymentsReceived` records where `payment_method` is 'Cash'. Second, to filter `Salespersons` based on whether they have any associated cash payments.
    *   `HAS()`: This aggregation function checks if a salesperson has at least one sale linked to a cash payment. We'll use `HAS(...) == 1` to ensure the condition is met.
    *   `.CALCULATE()`: To select only the `_id` field for the final output.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not needed here. We are filtering the `Salespersons` collection directly based on a condition related to their linked records. The filtering process itself will result in a distinct list of salespersons meeting the criteria.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not required for this query.

5.  **Code Generation**:

```python
# Filter salespersons who have at least one sale associated with a cash payment
cash_payment_salespersons = Salespersons.WHERE(
    HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash')) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    salesperson_id=_id # Select only the salesperson ID

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   `Salespersons`: Start with the collection of all salespersons.
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: Filter this collection.
    *   `HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'Cash'))`: For each salesperson, navigate through their `sales_made` to the associated `payment` records. Filter these payments to keep only those where `payment_method == 'Cash'`. `HAS()` then checks if *any* such cash payment exists for the salesperson.
    *   `== 1`: Ensure the `HAS()` condition is true (at least one cash payment exists).

1.  **`Salespersons`**: This is the primary collection we need to start with, as the request is about salespersons.
2.  **`CALCULATE`**: This function is used twice. First, to compute the necessary aggregations (sales count and total revenue) for each salesperson based on their recent sales. Second, to select and format the final required output fields (first name, last name, sales count, revenue).
3.  **`sales_made`**: This sub-collection within `Salespersons` links each salesperson to the sales they have made. We need to access this to filter and aggregate sales data.
4.  **`WHERE`**: This function is used to filter the `sales_made` sub-collection to include only those sales that occurred within the last 30 days.
5.  **`DATEDIFF`**: This function calculates the difference between two dates. We use it with `""days""` unit to compare the `sale_date` with the current date.
6.  **`DATETIME('now')`**: This function provides the current timestamp, which is needed as the reference point for the ""last 30 days"" calculation in `DATEDIFF`.
7.  **`COUNT`**: This aggregation function counts the number of sales records within the filtered `recent_sales` for each salesperson.
8.  **`SUM`**: This aggregation function calculates the total `sale_price` from the filtered `recent_sales` for each salesperson, representing their total revenue in the period.
9.  **`TOP_K`**: This function selects the top 5 salespersons based on the calculated `total_sales_count` in descending order.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

`PARTITION` is not necessary for this query. The aggregation is performed directly on the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson within the `Salespersons.CALCULATE` context. This implicitly groups the calculations by salesperson.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Calculate sales count and revenue for each salesperson for sales in the last 30 days
top_salespersons_by_sales = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    # Store salesperson names temporarily
    sp_first_name=first_name,
    sp_last_name=last_name,

    last_name=sp_last_name,
    total_sales_count=sales_count_last_30d,
    total_revenue_amount=revenue_last_30d
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` computes three main things for each salesperson:
    *   It stores their `first_name` and `last_name` in temporary variables `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name`.
    *   It defines `recent_sales` by filtering the `sales_made` sub-collection to include only sales where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30.
    *   It calculates `sales_count_last_30d` by counting the records in `recent_sales`.
    *   It calculates `revenue_last_30d` by summing the `sale_price` for all records in `recent_sales`.
3.  `TOP_K(5, by=sales_count_last_30d.DESC())` selects the 5 salespersons with the highest `sales_count_last_30d`.
4.  The final `CALCULATE` selects the required fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_count`, `total_revenue_amount`) using the previously calculated values and assigns them the requested output names.","# CALCULATE sales count and revenue for each salesperson for sales in the last 30 days

**1. Function Selection & Justification**

*   **`Sales`**: We need to start here as it contains the `sale_price` (revenue) and links to the `customer`.
*   **`customer.state`**: We need to access the state associated with the customer who made the purchase.
*   **`customer._id`**: We need a unique identifier for the customer to count distinct customers per state.
*   **`CALCULATE`**: Used initially to extract necessary fields (`sale_price`, `customer.state`, `customer._id`) from the `Sales` collection and its related `customer`. Also used after `PARTITION` to compute the aggregates.
*   **`PARTITION`**: Essential for grouping the sales data by `customer.state`.
*   **`SUM`**: Required to calculate the total `sale_price` within each state partition.
*   **`NDISTINCT`**: Needed to count the number of unique customers within each state partition.
*   **`TOP_K`**: Used to select the 5 states with the highest total revenue.

**2. Partitioning Strategy**

We will partition the sales data by the customer's state (`customer.state`). This allows us to perform aggregations (sum of revenue, count of unique customers) for each state independently. We first need to bring `customer.state` and `customer._id` into the context of `Sales` using `CALCULATE`.

**3. Code Generation**

```python
# Calculate necessary fields from Sales and related Customer
sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(
    price=sale_price,
    cust_state=customer.state,
    customer_identifier=customer._id
)

# Partition by customer state and calculate aggregates
top_states_by_revenue = PARTITION(
    sales_info,
    name='sales_per_state',  # Name for the partitioned group
    by=cust_state          # Field to partition by
).CALCULATE(
    state_name=cust_state,  # Select the state name (partition key)
    total_revenue=SUM(sales_per_state.price),  # Calculate total revenue for the state
    num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(sales_per_state.customer_identifier) # Count unique customers in the state
).TOP_K(
    5,  # Select the top 5
    by=total_revenue.DESC() # Order by total revenue descending
)
```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Sales` collection and creates an intermediate collection called `sales_info`. For each sale, it selects the `sale_price` (aliased as `price`), the customer's state (`customer.state`, aliased as `cust_state`), and the customer's unique ID (`customer._id`, aliased as `customer_identifier`).
2.  **`PARTITION(sales_info, name='sales_per_state', by=cust_state)`**: This partitions the `sales_info` collection into groups based on the `cust_state` field. Each group contains all sales records for customers from a specific state. The grouped data within each partition can be accessed using the name `sales_per_state`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each partition created in the previous step.
    *   `state_name=cust_state`: Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_per_state.price)`: Calculates the sum of the `price` for all sales within the current state's partition (`sales_per_state`).
    *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(sales_per_state.customer_identifier)`: Counts the number of distinct `customer_identifier` values within the current state's partition, giving the unique customer count for that state.
4.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` (one row per state with its name, total revenue, and unique customer count) and selects the top 5 rows based on the `total_revenue` in descending order.

The final variable `top_states_by_revenue` holds a collection with 5 rows, each containing the `state_name`, `total_revenue`, and `num_unique_customers` for the top 5 states by revenue.","# CALCULATE necessary fields from Sales and related Customer

**Explanation:**

1.  `PARTITION(PaymentsReceived, name='payments_group', by=payment_method)`: This groups all records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection based on their `payment_method`. Each group is accessible via the name `payments_group`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`: This line defines a variable holding the date exactly 3 months prior to the current moment.
2.  `salesperson_performance = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each salesperson.
3.  `rep_first_name=first_name, rep_last_name=last_name`: We select the first and last names of the salespersons.
4.  `total_revenue_last_3m=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`: For each salesperson, this filters their `sales_made` to include only those on or after `start_date_3_months_ago` and then calculates the sum of `sale_price` for these filtered sales.
5.  `total_sales_last_3m=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`: Similarly, this counts the number of sales made by the salesperson within the specified 3-month period.
6.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue_last_3m.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which includes all salespersons with their calculated revenue and sales count) and selects the top 3 based on `total_revenue_last_3m` in descending order.
7.  `.CALCULATE(first_name=rep_first_name, ...)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output format (`first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales`, `total_revenue`).","# Define the start date for the last 3 months
start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')

    *   `Salespersons`: Access the collection containing salesperson data.
    *   `WHERE`: Filter salespersons to include only those with a `termination_date`. The `PRESENT()` function will be used to check for non-null termination dates.
    *   `CALCULATE`: Calculate the employment duration for each salesperson using `DATEDIFF` and select the required fields.
    *   `DATEDIFF`: Calculate the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date`.
    *   `TOP_K`: Select the salesperson with the minimum employment duration.

*   **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not required as the calculation is performed per salesperson and we are looking for a single minimum across all terminated salespersons.

*   **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not needed; `TOP_K` is sufficient to find the minimum duration.

    2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates a new field `employment_duration_days` by finding the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF`. It also selects the first name, last name, and phone number, renaming them temporarily to avoid conflicts.
    3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`: Selects the single record (`k=1`) with the smallest `employment_duration_days`. `.ASC()` ensures we get the minimum duration.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Selects the final required fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, and the calculated `employment_duration_days` from the single record identified in the previous step.","# Filter for salespersons who have been terminated and CALCULATE their employment duration in days

Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company',"SELECT COUNT(*) AS weekend_payments FROM payments_made WHERE vendor_name = 'Utility Company' AND strftime('%w', payment_date) IN ('0', '6');",Dealership,"Okay, let's break this down.

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to count payments from the `PaymentsMade` collection that meet two criteria: the `vendor_name` must be 'Utility Company', and the `payment_date` must fall on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `PaymentsMade`: This is the primary collection containing the payment data.
    *   `WHERE`: We need this function to filter the payments based on the vendor name and the day of the week.
    *   `DAYOFWEEK` (Assumption): To determine if a `payment_date` is a weekend. **Note:** The provided PyDough reference does not explicitly list a `DAYOFWEEK` function. I will proceed assuming such a function exists, where Sunday=1 and Saturday=7, but this is a necessary assumption. If this function doesn't exist, the query needs modification based on available date functions.
    *   `ISIN`: This is useful for checking if the result of `DAYOFWEEK(payment_date)` is either 1 (Sunday) or 7 (Saturday).
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of payments that satisfy both filter conditions.
    *   `GRAPH.CALCULATE`: Since we need a single aggregated value (the total count), we perform the calculation at the graph level.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not required because we are calculating a single aggregate count across the filtered data, not grouping by any specific key.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not needed for this task.

5.  **Code Generation**:

```python

    *   `ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (1, 7))`: This condition filters for payments where the day of the week of the `payment_date` is either 1 (assumed Sunday) or 7 (assumed Saturday). The `&` combines these two conditions, requiring both to be true.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the number of records remaining after applying the filters.

    2.  `payments_prev_week_daily`: This variable filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
        *   `.WHERE(...)`: Selects only payments where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous ISO week (inclusive).
        *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Creates new fields: `pay_day` by truncating `payment_date` to its day component, `pay_method` (renaming `payment_method`), and `pay_amount` (renaming `payment_amount`). This prepares the data for partitioning.
    3.  `daily_payment_totals`: This variable performs the grouping and aggregation.
        *   `PARTITION(...)`: Groups the `payments_prev_week_daily` collection. The `name` 'payment\_group' is assigned to access data within each partition. The `by` parameter specifies grouping by the calculated `pay_day` and the `pay_method`.
        *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by `PARTITION`, it calculates the final output fields: `payment_date_day` (from the partition key `pay_day`), `payment_method_used` (from the partition key `pay_method`), and `total_amount_received` by summing the `pay_amount` for all records within that specific day/method group (`payment_group.pay_amount`).
        *   `.ORDER_BY(...)`: Sorts the final results first by the day (`payment_date_day`) and then by the payment method (`payment_method_used`) for easier interpretation.","# Define the start and end dates for the previous ISO week

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to calculate the sum of transaction amounts (`amount`) from the `Transactions` collection. This sum should be aggregated quarterly for the year 2023 and grouped by the customer's state (`state` from the `Customers` collection). Each quarter needs to be represented by its starting date (e.g., 2023-01-01 for Q1).

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `Transactions`: The source collection containing sales amounts and dates.
    *   `customer`: To access the customer information linked to each transaction.
    *   `WHERE`: To filter transactions for the year 2023 using `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To extract necessary fields and derive new ones:
        *   Customer's state (`customer.state`). Using `DEFAULT_TO` to handle cases where the customer or state might be missing.
        *   Transaction amount (`amount`).
        *   Quarter start date. This requires deriving the quarter from `date_time` and then constructing the first date of that quarter using `DATETIME` and `IFF` or a mathematical approach.
    *   `DATETIME`: To manipulate dates, specifically to get the start of the year (`'start of year'`) and add months (`'+3 months'`, `'+6 months'`, `'+9 months'`) to find the quarter start dates.
    *   `MONTH`: To extract the month number from `date_time` to determine the quarter.
    *   `IFF`: To conditionally determine the quarter start date based on the month.
    *   `PARTITION`: To group the calculated transaction data by `cust_state` and the derived `quarter_start_date`.
    *   `SUM`: An aggregation function used within the `PARTITION`'s `CALCULATE` step to sum the transaction amounts (`tx_amount`) for each group.
    *   `ORDER_BY`: (Optional but recommended for readability) To sort the final results by state and then by quarter start date.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is necessary here because we need to group the results by two distinct attributes (customer state and quarter start date) and then perform an aggregation (`SUM`) within each group. We will partition by the derived `cust_state` and `qtr_start` fields.

4.  **Code Generation**:

5.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   The code first filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   It then uses a series of `CALCULATE` steps to prepare the data:
        *   Extracts the transaction `amount` and the customer's `state` (using `DEFAULT_TO` for safety).
        *   Calculates the start date of the year for each transaction's date.
        *   Determines the month number (1-12).
        *   Assigns a quarter number (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the month.
        *   Calculates the first date of the corresponding quarter using `DATETIME` adjustments based on the quarter number.
    *   The prepared data (`tx_data_with_qtr`) now contains the transaction amount, customer state, and the quarter start date for each 2023 transaction.
    *   `PARTITION` groups this data first by customer state (`cust_state`) and then by the calculated quarter start date (`qtr_start`).
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on these groups:
        *   It selects the `state` and `quarter_start_date` (which are the keys used for partitioning).
        *   It calculates the `total_sales` for each group by `SUM`ming the `tx_amount` of all transactions belonging to that specific state and quarter.
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY` sorts the results alphabetically by state and chronologically by the quarter start date.","# CALCULATE intermediate fields for each relevant transaction in 2023

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to find cars listed as `is_in_inventory = True` in the `InventorySnapshots` collection. Specifically, we only care about snapshots taken in March 2023, and among those, only the *latest* one for that month. Finally, we need to return the `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year` of these cars.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification**:
    *   `InventorySnapshots`: This is the starting collection containing inventory status and dates.
    *   `WHERE`: Needed multiple times:
        *   To filter snapshots by year and month (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023` and `MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`).
        *   To filter snapshots where the car is in inventory (`is_in_inventory == True`).
        *   To filter for the latest snapshot within the March 2023 set using `RANKING`.
    *   `YEAR`, `MONTH`: Required to extract date parts from `snapshot_date` for filtering.
    *   `RANKING`: The best way to identify the ""latest"" snapshot within the filtered group (March 2023, in inventory). We rank by `snapshot_date` descending and take rank 1. `levels` is not needed here as we are ranking within the filtered `InventorySnapshots` collection itself, not within a sub-collection hierarchy relative to an ancestor.
    *   `.car`: To navigate from the filtered `InventorySnapshots` records to the associated `Cars` records.
    *   `CALCULATE`: To select the final required fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) from the `Cars` collection.

3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not needed here. We are filtering and ranking within the `InventorySnapshots` collection directly, not grouping by any specific key to perform aggregate calculations per group.

4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1` will correctly identify the latest snapshot within the pre-filtered set (March 2023, in inventory).

5.  **Code Generation**:

```python
# Filter snapshots for March 2023 where the car is marked as in inventory
march_inventory_snapshots = InventorySnapshots.WHERE(
    (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) &
    (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3) &
    (is_in_inventory == True)
)

# From the March 2023 inventory snapshots, filter to keep only the latest one for each car
# Then, access the car details and select the required fields.
# RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1 identifies the latest snapshot within the filtered context.
latest_march_inventory_cars = march_inventory_snapshots.WHERE(
    RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1
).car.CALCULATE(
    car_id=_id,
    car_make=make,
    car_model=model,
    car_year=year
)
```

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    *   `march_inventory_snapshots = InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `InventorySnapshots` collection to include only records where the `snapshot_date` is in March 2023 (`YEAR == 2023` and `MONTH == 3`) AND the `is_in_inventory` flag is `True`.
    *   `latest_march_inventory_cars = march_inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)`: This takes the previously filtered snapshots and applies another filter. `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC())` assigns a rank to each snapshot within this filtered set, with rank 1 being the latest date. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those snapshots with rank 1 (the latest ones).
    *   `.car`: This accesses the `car` record linked to each of the latest inventory snapshots identified.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This selects and potentially renames the desired fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) from the `Cars` collection associated with the latest inventory snapshots. The result is assigned to the `latest_march_inventory_cars` variable.","# Filter snapshots for March 2023 WHERE the car is marked as in inventory
