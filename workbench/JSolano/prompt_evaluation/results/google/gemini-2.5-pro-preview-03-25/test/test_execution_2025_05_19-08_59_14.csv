1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. This is done by checking `COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5`.
3.  For the filtered customers, calculate their success rate. We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is ""Completed"". The success rate is calculated as: `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`.
4.  Select the customer's name and their calculated success rate.
5.  Order the results by the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers, keeping only those for whom the count of their `transactions_made` (i.e., total transactions) is greater than or equal to 5.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   For each customer passing the filter, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: This selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0`:
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: This counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be the count of successful transactions.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: This counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The division of these two counts gives the ratio of successful transactions to total transactions.
            *   Multiplying by `100.0` converts this ratio to a percentage.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate`) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`.ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.",25.9496431350708,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG tickers. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in combination with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol` within the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering the `Customers` collection directly.
5.  The final result will be a single number, so we'll use `Broker.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')

# Filter customers who:
# 1. Have an email address ending with "".com""
# 2. Have made at least one transaction involving a FAANG stock

)

# Calculate the count of these distinct customers
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`: This line defines a tuple (which acts like a list in this context) containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression that makes the query cleaner.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Customers` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition. It checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Within the transactions of a customer, this filters for transactions where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` list. `ISIN` checks for membership.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the preceding filtered collection (transactions of FAANG stocks for that customer) has at least one record. If it does, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this comparison).
6.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_customers` contains the collection of customers who meet both criteria.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of records in this `filtered_customers` collection, which gives the number of distinct customers.

1.  **Identify Stock Transactions**: Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
2.  **Calculate Week Information**: For each stock transaction:
    *   Determine the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. The definition of ""start of week"" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the system's date configuration.
    *   Flag whether the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.
3.  **Filter for the Target Period**:
    *   Establish the current week's start date: `current_week_start_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Define the date range for the 8 weeks of interest:
        *   The most recent week to include is ""last week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-1 week')`.
        *   The oldest week to include is ""8 weeks ago from the current week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-8 weeks')`.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered transactions by their `week_start_dt`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

""Last week"" is defined as the 7-day period starting from `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` up to, but not including, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:

2.  For each customer, calculate their name, the total number of transactions they've made, and the sum of the amounts of these transactions. We'll use `CALCULATE` for this, with `COUNT(transactions_made)` for the number of transactions and `SUM(transactions_made.amount)` for the total transaction amount.
3.  On the result of the previous step, calculate the customer rank (CR). The rank is based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1). This can be done using the `RANKING` window function.
4.  The final `CALCULATE` will select the customer's name, the calculated number of transactions, the total transaction amount, and the computed rank (CR).

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` operation processes the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it computes:
    *   `c_name`: The customer's `name`.
    *   `n_transactions`: The total count of transactions linked to the customer via the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `total_transaction_val`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by the customer.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the output of the first step (`customer_aggregates`). It selects the previously calculated fields and adds the `CR` (Customer Rank):
    *   `customer_name`: Renamed from `c_name`.
    *   `number_of_transactions`: Renamed from `n_transactions`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Renamed from `total_transaction_val`.
    *   `CR`: This is computed using the `RANKING(by=total_transaction_val.DESC())` function. It ranks customers based on their `total_transaction_val` in descending order, so the customer with the highest total transaction amount receives rank 1. This ranking is performed across all customers.",29.622955560684204,"# Step 1: Calculate per-customer aggregates.

1.  Start with the `Transactions` collection.
2.  For each transaction, extract the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction date/time (`date_time`), and the transaction type (`transaction_type`). We use `CALCULATE` for this.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those that:
    *   Are of type ""BUY"".
    *   Occurred within the last 10 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_dt, DATETIME('now')) <= 9`. This condition covers a 10-day window including the current day (e.g., if today is Day 10, this includes Day 1 through Day 10).
4.  Group the filtered transactions by the ticker symbol using `PARTITION`. The partition key will be the `ticker_s` (ticker symbol) calculated earlier.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), calculate the number of buy transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`. The output fields will be `ticker_symbol` and `num_buy_transactions`.
6.  Finally, use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order of count.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first calculate the start and end dates for our period of interest. The start date is the beginning of the month 6 months ago, and the end date is the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month**: For each selected customer, we determine their signup month in a 'YYYY-MM' format. This will be used for grouping.
4.  **Partition by Signup Month**: We group the filtered customers by their `signup_month_str`.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month group, PMCS is the count of customers who signed up in that month. This is `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month group, PMAT is the average transaction amount across all transactions made by customers who signed up in that month. This is `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`.
6.  **Order Results**: The results are ordered by the signup month.

```python
customer_signup_metrics = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Broker` level to define `start_period_date` (6 months ago, start of that month) and `end_period_date` (start of the current month). These dates define our window of interest.
2.  `.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them to include only those whose `join_date` is within our calculated `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month_str=...)`: For these filtered customers, we create a new field `signup_month_str` by combining the year and month of their `join_date` (e.g., ""2023-07""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""signup_months_group"", by=(signup_month_str))`: We then partition these customers into groups based on their `signup_month_str`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month=signup_month_str, PMCS=COUNT(Customers), PMAT=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount))`: For each group (i.e., for each signup month):
    *   `signup_month`: We output the signup month string.
    *   `PMCS`: We calculate `COUNT(Customers)` which counts the number of customers within that specific `signup_month_str` group.
    *   `PMAT`: We calculate `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions (`transactions_made`) from all customers who signed up in that particular month and computes the average of their transaction `amount`.

1.  Filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records from the last 7 days. This is achieved by comparing the `date` of each record with the current date using `DATEDIFF`.
2.  For these filtered records, we extract the `ticker_type` (by navigating the `ticker` relationship to the `Tickers` collection) and the `close` price. These are stored in intermediate calculated fields `ttype` and `cprice`.

The AR is defined as `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Here's how the PyDough code implements this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: It first selects customers who joined in 2022 using `Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`. For each of these customers, it creates a flag `is_active_flag` which is true (1) if the customer has made any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) and false (0) otherwise. This collection is named `filtered_customers`.

2.  **Group by Country and Aggregate**: The `filtered_customers` are then partitioned by their `country` using `PARTITION(name=""country_data"", by=(country))`. For each country group:
    *   `num_active_customers_in_country`: This is calculated by summing the `is_active_flag` for all customers in that country group (`SUM(filtered_customers.is_active_flag)`). This effectively counts customers who joined in 2022, belong to the specific country, and have transactions.
    *   `total_customers_in_country_cohort`: This is the total count of customers within that country group (`COUNT(filtered_customers)`), representing all customers who joined in 2022 and belong to that country.

3.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `activity_ratio_value`.
    *   The AR is `(num_active_customers_in_country * 100.0) / total_customers_in_country_cohort`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country_cohort` might be zero (i.e., no customers joined from that country in 2022) to prevent division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   This interpretation assumes that for the cohort ""customers who joined in 2022"", ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" refers to those in the cohort with transactions, and ""Total Number of Customers"" (in the denominator of the AR formula) refers to all customers in that cohort for the given country.

4.  **Format Final Result**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `country` and `AR` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of customers meeting the criteria).
2.  **`number_of_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `number_of_customers` that will hold the count.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is used on the `name` and `state` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the first condition for the customer's name:
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two name conditions.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This part checks the second condition: if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
7.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name condition (itself a combination of two ORed conditions) and the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria.
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: After filtering, `COUNT()` counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy all the specified conditions.",13.495714664459229,"customer_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions**:
    The code first filters the `Transactions` collection to select only those transactions that:
    *   Are of `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred within the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"". This is achieved by checking if `date_time` is between `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` (exactly one month ago) and `DATETIME('now')` (the current moment).

2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate Metrics**:
    *   The filtered sell transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `ticker.symbol` using `filtered_sell_transactions.PARTITION(name=""sells_by_ticker"", by=(ticker.symbol))`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol with sell transactions in the specified period), the code calculates:
        *   `total_amount_sells`: The sum of the `amount` for all sell transactions of that ticker.
        *   `total_tax_and_commission`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) for all sell transactions of that ticker.

3.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) is calculated for each ticker symbol.
    *   The formula `SPM = (total_amount_sells - total_tax_and_commission) / total_amount_sells * 100.0` is applied.
    *   An `IFF` condition (`IFF(total_amount_sells == 0, 0.0, ...)` is used to handle cases where `total_amount_sells` might be zero. If it's zero, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors; otherwise, the SPM is calculated normally.

4.  **Final Output**:
    The `result` variable will contain a collection where each record includes the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding calculated `SPM` for sell transactions in the past month.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",114.90851283073424,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates an operation on the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_id=_id, c_name=name`: We select the customer's `_id` and `name`, renaming them to `c_id` and `c_name` for use in subsequent steps.
    *   `num_join_month_txns=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same month and year as their `join_date`.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions where the month of `date_time` matches the month of `join_date`, AND the year of `date_time` matches the year of `join_date` are considered.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_join_month_txns.DESC())`: After calculating `num_join_month_txns` for every customer, this function selects the top 1 customer who has the highest `num_join_month_txns`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the highest count is ranked first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(calculated_total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount))`:
    *   This part iterates through each customer in the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates the sum of the `amount` field from all their associated transactions (accessed via `transactions_made.amount`). This sum is stored in a new temporary field named `calculated_total_amount`.
    *   Other original fields of the `Customers` collection, like `name`, are implicitly available for subsequent operations.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=calculated_total_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This function takes the collection of customers (each now having the `calculated_total_amount`) and selects the top 5.
    *   The selection is ordered by the `calculated_total_amount` field in descending order (`DESC()`), so customers with higher total transaction amounts come first.

3.  `.CALCULATE(name=name, total_amount=calculated_total_amount)`:
    *   This final step takes the top 5 customers selected by `TOP_K`.

1.  **Filter Transactions by Date**: We start by selecting transactions that occurred within the specified date range. The `date_time` field will be used for this, ensuring we include transactions from January 1, 2023, up to and including March 31, 2023. We use `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"")` for the start and `DATETIME(""2023-04-01"")` for the exclusive end of the range.
2.  **Partition by Transaction Type**: The filtered transactions are then grouped (partitioned) by their `transaction_type`.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Type**: For each transaction type group, we calculate:
    *   `num_distinct_customers`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`.
    *   `avg_shares_val`: The average number of shares involved in transactions of this type. This is calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`.
    The partition key `transaction_type` is also carried forward as `transaction_type_val`.
4.  **Identify Top 3 Types**: We then select the top 3 transaction types based on the `num_distinct_customers`, ordered in descending order, using the `TOP_K` function.

    *   `c_state`: Stores the state of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.state`).
    *   `t_type`: Stores the type of the ticker associated with the transaction (`ticker.ticker_type`).

2.  `state_ticker_combinations = transaction_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""state_type_groups"", by=(c_state, t_type))`: This groups the records from `transaction_info` based on unique combinations of `c_state` and `t_type`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=c_state, ticker_type=t_type, number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination) created by the partition:
        *   `customer_state=c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `ticker_type=t_type`: Selects the ticker type for the group.
        *   `number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions that fall into this specific combination of customer state and ticker type.

3.  `result = state_ticker_combinations.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the collection of state-ticker combinations (with their transaction counts) and selects the top 5.
    *   `by=number_of_transactions.DESC()`: The selection is ordered by the `number_of_transactions` field in descending order, so the combinations with the most transactions appear first.

result = Broker.CALCULATE(

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause applies two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This filters the records to include only those where the associated `ticker` has a `symbol` of ""VTI"".
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This filters the records to the last 7 days. `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the price record's `date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`). A value of 0 means today, 1 means yesterday, and so on. So, `<= 6` includes records from today up to 6 days ago, covering a 7-day period.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We use `Broker.CALCULATE` (assuming `Broker` is the top-level graph object) to compute a single aggregated value.
    *   `lowest_closing_price_vti_past_7_days = MIN(filtered_vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`: This calculates the minimum (`MIN`) closing price (`close`) from the `filtered_vti_prices_last_7_days` collection obtained in the previous step. The result is assigned to a new field named `lowest_closing_price_vti_past_7_days`.

The final `result` will be a collection with a single row and a single column containing the lowest closing price for VTI in the specified period.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in 2023, are within the first quarter (January, February, March), and have a status of ""successful"".
2.  From these filtered transactions, we extract the month of the transaction. This month will be used for grouping.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Selects transactions from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Selects transactions from January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, this step calculates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from the `date_time` field. This new field will be used as the key for partitioning. The original `price` field of the filtered transactions remains available for aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered and augmented transactions by the `transaction_month`. Each group (partition) will contain transactions from a specific month of Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each monthly group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `month = transaction_month`: The month number (1, 2, or 3) is selected for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: The average transaction price is calculated. `AVG(Transactions.price)` computes the average of the `price` field for all `Transactions` records that fall into the current month's partition (due to the preceding `WHERE` and `PARTITION` clauses).
5.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: The final result, which contains each month of Q1 2023 (that had successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price, is ordered by month in ascending order.",60.30006623268128,"# Step 1: Filter transactions for Q1 2023, successful status, and extract the transaction month.

2.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales records where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000. These calculations will have access to the date boundaries defined in step 1.
3.  **Access Payments**: For these filtered sales, access their associated `payment` records.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: Keep only those payments that fall within the 8-week analysis period. The period is from `analysis_period_start_dt` (inclusive) up to `current_week_start_dt` (exclusive).
5.  **Augment Payment Data**: For each payment in the analysis window:
    *   Calculate the start date of the week in which the payment occurred (`payment_week_start_date_attr`). This will serve as our weekly grouping key.
    *   Create a flag (`is_weekend_payment_attr`) which is 1 if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, and 0 otherwise.
6.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the augmented payment data by `payment_week_start_date_attr`. For each week:
    *   Output the week start date as `week`.
    *   Count the total number of payments (`total_payments_received`).
    *   Sum the `is_weekend_payment_attr` flag to get the count of weekend payments (`weekend_payments_received`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter `Cars`**:
    *   The query starts by selecting from the `Cars` collection.
    *   It filters these cars using `WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`. This condition selects cars where their `vin_number` contains 'M5'.
        *   `LOWER(vin_number)` converts the VIN number to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%m5%')` performs a partial match, finding 'm5' anywhere within the lowercase VIN number.

2.  **Partition by Car Model**:
    *   The filtered cars are then partitioned using `.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`.
    *   This groups the cars by unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group in `model_group` represents a distinct car model that met the VIN criteria.

3.  **Calculate Sales per Model**:

    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for each car model group.
        *   `Cars` within this `CALCULATE` refers to the sub-collection of cars belonging to the current (make, model) partition.
        *   `Cars.sale_records` accesses all sale records associated with these cars.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts these sale records to get the total number of sales for that specific car make and model.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_data = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons.
    *   `total_sales_amount_calc=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: For each salesperson, it calculates the sum of `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (found in the `sales_made` sub-collection). This sum is stored as `total_sales_amount_calc`.
    *   `number_of_sales_calc=COUNT(sales_made)`: For each salesperson, it counts the number of sales records in their `sales_made` sub-collection. This count is stored as `number_of_sales_calc`.

2.  `result = sales_data.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the intermediate `sales_data` collection (which now includes `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount_calc`, and `number_of_sales_calc` for each salesperson).
    *   `first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: Passes through the names.
    *   `total_sales_amount=total_sales_amount_calc`: Renames `total_sales_amount_calc` to `total_sales_amount` for the final output.
    *   `number_of_sales=number_of_sales_calc`: Renames `number_of_sales_calc` to `number_of_sales` for the final output.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount_calc.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `total_sales_amount_calc` field, and `DESC()` ensures that the ranking is in descending order (higher sales amount gets a better rank, e.g., rank 1).

The final `result` collection will contain the first name, last name, total sales amount, number of sales, and the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.",37.64351940155029,"# Calculate total sales amount and number of sales for each salesperson

1.  **Identify Cars with Known Inventory Status**: Start with the `Cars` collection. Filter for cars that have at least one entry in `inventory_snapshots`, as this is required to determine their latest inventory status. For each of these cars, calculate its make, model, and a boolean flag (`latest_inventory_status_bool`) indicating if it's currently in inventory based on its most recent snapshot. The most recent snapshot is found by ranking snapshots by `snapshot_date` in descending order and picking the top one.
2.  **Filter for Cars No Longer in Inventory**: From the above set of cars, filter further to retain only those where `latest_inventory_status_bool` is `False`. These are the cars confirmed to be no longer in inventory.
3.  **Get Sales Details for These Cars**: For the cars identified in step 2, access their `sale_records`. This effectively gives us all sales of cars that are confirmed to be no longer in inventory. For each sale, we extract the car's make and model (propagated from the parent car context) and the `sale_price` of that specific sale.
4.  **Group by Make and Model**: The resulting collection of individual sales (each with make, model, and price) is then partitioned by make and model.
5.  **Calculate Highest Sale Price per Group**: For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` among all sales in that group.
6.  **Order and Format Output**: Finally, order these grouped results by the calculated maximum sale price in descending order. The final output will include the make, model, and the highest sale price.

2.  Filter these cars using a `WHERE` clause. The condition will check if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang', using the `LIKE` operator for partial and case-insensitive matching.
3.  For the filtered cars, use the `CALCULATE` method to:
    *   Select the `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `vin_number`.
    *   Calculate the average sale price for each car using `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`. The `sale_records` sub-collection links cars to their sales, and `sale_price` is a field in the `Sales` collection.

```
Explanation:
-   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    -   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""NewFord"", ""FordMotors"" would all match if ""ford"" is present). `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    -   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains ""mustang"".
    -   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'ford' OR its model contains 'mustang'.
-   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each car that meets the filter criteria, this function computes the specified output fields.
    -   `car_make=make`, `car_model=model`, `car_year=year`, `car_color=color`, `car_vin_number=vin_number`: These select the respective details of the car.
    -   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for the car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales associated with the car, and `sale_price` is the price from each sale. The `AVG` function aggregates these prices to find the average for that specific car. If a car has no sales, the `avg_sale_price` will typically be null.",24.07662582397461,"result = Cars.WHERE(

    *   The reporting period will end just before the start of the current month (i.e., covering the entirety of the previous 6 months).

3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**:
    *   For each filtered sale, calculate the `sale_month_truncated` by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month. This will be used for grouping.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the prepared sales data by `sale_month_truncated`.

    *   Order the final results by month in ascending order.

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment. This difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_difference`.

2.  **`AVG(...)`**:
    *   The `AVG()` function then calculates the average of all the `days_difference` values computed in the previous step across all payment records.

3.  **`ROUND(..., 2)`**:

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to:
1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for these sales.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of `cost` for the cars sold.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The PyDough code will first calculate the total revenue and total cost for sales in 2023. Then, it will use these values in a subsequent `CALCULATE` step to compute the GPM.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across all relevant sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For these filtered sales, it accesses their `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale in 2023, it navigates to the related `car` (from the `Cars` collection) and accesses its `cost`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_for_2023 = ...)`: This second `CALCULATE` step takes the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023` computed in the first step.
5.  `gpm_for_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023) / total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 * 100`: This applies the GPM formula to calculate the gross profit margin for 2023 sales.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to find sales where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `car` associated with each sale.
    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:
        *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.
        *   `model=car.model`: Retrieves the `model` of the car.
        *   `sale_price=sale_price`: Retrieves the `sale_price` from the sale record.

2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` will give us the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only salespersons who have at least one sale record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. The `HAS(sales_made) == 1` condition ensures that `COUNT(sales_made)` will be greater than zero, preventing division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this `CALCULATE` function computes new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Stores the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Stores the salesperson's last name.

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""payment_method_groups"", by=(payment_method))`: This groups all records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection by the unique values in the `payment_method` field. Each group is named `payment_method_groups` internally for this step.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `payment_method_name=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` for the current group.
    *   `num_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts the number of payment records within the current `payment_method` group.
    *   `total_amount_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Sums the `payment_amount` for all payments within the current `payment_method` group.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_amount_received.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection where each record represents a payment method with its total payments and total amount) and selects the top 3 records, ordered by `total_amount_received` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car via the `car` relationship. These are aliased as `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model` to be used as partition keys.
2.  `grouped_by_model = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: The `sales_with_details` collection is then partitioned. The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by unique combinations of `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model`. Each group is named `sales_per_model_group`.
3.  `model_summary = grouped_by_model.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `make`: The car make (from the partition key `resolved_car_make`).
    *   `model`: The car model (from the partition key `resolved_car_model`).
    *   `total_number_of_sales`: The total count of sales for that specific make and model, obtained using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales of that specific make and model, obtained using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
4.  `top_models_by_revenue = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, `TOP_K` is applied to the `model_summary` to get the top 5 entries, ordered by `total_revenue` in descending order. The resulting collection `top_models_by_revenue` will contain the make, model, total number of sales, and total revenue for the 5 best-selling car models.",51.032689571380615,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make and model information.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   The previous ISO week starts on the Monday of last week and ends on the Sunday of last week.
    *   We calculate `start_prev_week_calc` as the Monday of the previous week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`).

    *   The payments will be filtered for `payment_date` between `start_prev_week_calc` (inclusive) and `start_curr_week_calc` (exclusive).

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   Filter these payments to include only those made within the calculated date range of the previous ISO week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For each filtered payment, extract the actual calendar day (`payment_actual_day_key`) using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This ensures payments on the same day are grouped together, regardless of the time.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` as `payment_method_key` for grouping.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Use `PARTITION` to group the prepared payment records by `payment_actual_day_key` and `payment_method_key`.
    *   Within each group, calculate the `total_daily_payment_amount` by summing `PaymentsReceived.payment_amount`.

5.  **Format and Order Output**:
    *   Select the `payment_day` (from `payment_actual_day_key`), `payment_method` (from `payment_method_key`), and the calculated `total_amount`.
    *   Order the results by `payment_day` and then by `payment_method` for clarity.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  For each of these sales, we'll determine the customer's state and calculate the first date of the quarter in which the sale occurred. The quarter's first date (e.g., ""2023-01-01"" for Q1, ""2023-04-01"" for Q2, etc.) will be derived based on the month of the `sale_date`.
3.  We will then partition (group) these processed sales records by the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  For each group, we will sum the `sale_price` to get the `total_quarterly_sales`.
5.  Finally, the results will be ordered by customer state and then by the quarter start date for consistent output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters sales to include only those made in the year 2023.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` derives two new fields for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: Stores the `state` from the linked `customer` record.
        *   `q_start_date`: Determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. This is done using nested `IFF` functions based on the month of the sale. String literals like ""2023-01-01"" are used to represent these dates.

2.  `result = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`: Groups the records from `sales_info` based on unique combinations of `c_state` (customer state) and `q_start_date` (quarter start date).
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=c_state, quarter_start_date=q_start_date, total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price))`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `customer_state=c_state`: Selects the customer state for the output.
        *   `quarter_start_date=q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the output.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific state and quarter group. `Sales.sale_price` refers to the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(customer_state.ASC(), quarter_start_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final result first by customer state in ascending order, and then by the quarter start date in ascending order. This ensures a structured and predictable output.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",60.105292320251465,"# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

5.  We then calculate the duration of each treatment in days using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`. We only consider treatments with a duration greater than 0 to avoid division by zero and ensure meaningful ""days of treatment"".
6.  For these valid treatments, we calculate the DDD as `tot_drug_amt / duration_days`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Drugs` collection and use `CALCULATE` to output the `drug_name` and the computed `average_ddd` for each drug.
*   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
*   `average_ddd=AVG(...)`: Calculates the average DDD. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug.
*   `treatments_used_in.WHERE(...)`: Filters the treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `(HASNOT(end_dt) == 0)`: This condition ensures that `end_dt` (end date of the treatment) is not null. `HASNOT(field) == 0` means the field is present/not null.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0)`: This condition ensures that the treatment duration is positive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.
*   `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, this calculates its individual DDD.
    *   `ddd_for_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
*   `.ddd_for_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_treatment` value from the inner `CALCULATE` so that `AVG` can operate on these scalar DDD values. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria, `AVG` will likely return null.",41.831589460372925,"avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(

5.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each month group:
    *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s to get the `patient_count`.
    *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s for treatments that were flagged as biologic to get the `biologic_treatment_count`.

result = monthly_patient_stats.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We first establish the date boundaries for our analysis. `val_current_month_start` is the first day of the current month, and `val_three_months_ago_start` is the first day of the month three months prior to the current month. This defines a period covering the last three full calendar months.
2.  `treatments_in_relevant_period = date_info.Treatments.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection. The `date_info` values are available in this context.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within our defined three-month window.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, we create:
        *   `p_id`: An alias for `patient_id` for easier reference.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the treatment's drug (`Treatments.drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'.
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2023-04"") representing the month of the treatment, used for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month part is always two digits.
3.  `monthly_patient_stats = treatments_in_relevant_period.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `treatments_in_relevant_period` data using `treatment_month_year_key`. This groups all treatments by the month in which they started.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each monthly group:
        *   `month=treatment_month_year_key`: Outputs the month string.
        *   `patient_count=NDISTINCT(treatments_in_relevant_period.p_id)`: Counts the number of unique patient IDs (`p_id`) within that month's group. This gives the total distinct patients treated in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_count=NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(treatments_in_relevant_period.p_id, treatments_in_relevant_period.is_biologic_treatment == True))`: Counts the number of unique patient IDs for whom `is_biologic_treatment` was true at least once in that month. `KEEP_IF` effectively filters `p_id`s to only those associated with biologic treatments before `NDISTINCT` counts them.

- `Patients.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Patients` collection.
- `HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if a patient has at least one treatment record that satisfies the nested conditions.
  - `treatments_received.WHERE(...)`: This filters the treatments for the current patient.
  - `(treatments_received.diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`: This checks if the diagnosis name for the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
  - `(treatments_received.drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')`: This checks if the drug type for the treatment is 'Biologic'.
  - The `&` operator combines these two conditions, ensuring both are true for a treatment to be counted.
- `COUNT(...)`: This counts the number of patients who satisfy the `WHERE` clause, effectively giving the distinct count of patients meeting the criteria.

1.  `start_date_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This defines the beginning of our 6-month window. It calculates the date corresponding to the start of the month that was six months ago from the current date.
2.  `end_date_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This defines the end of our window (exclusive). It's the start of the current month, so treatments must occur before this date.
3.  `alice_treatments = Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"").treatments_received`: This line first filters the `Patients` collection to find all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"". Then, it accesses their `treatments_received` sub-collection.
4.  `treatments_in_defined_period = alice_treatments.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `treatments_received` for Alice(s) to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within our defined period:

1.  **Calculate Distinct Drugs per Doctor**: For each doctor, we'll retrieve their `doc_id`, `speciality`, and calculate the total number of unique drugs they have prescribed. This is done by looking at their `prescribed_treatments`, then the `drug` associated with each treatment, and counting the distinct `drug_id`s.
2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We'll group the doctors based on their `speciality`. This allows us to perform ranking within each specialty group.
3.  **Rank Doctors within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, we'll calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking will be based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed, in descending order (doctors prescribing more distinct drugs will receive a numerically lower, i.e., ""higher"" or better, rank).

Here's the PyDough code:

    *   `speciality_val = speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs = NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: Calculates the number of unique drugs prescribed by each doctor. It accesses the `prescribed_treatments` for each doctor, then the `drug` associated with each of those treatments, and finally counts the number of distinct `drug_id`s.

2.  `doctors_partitioned = doctors_intermediate_data.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This step takes the `doctors_intermediate_data` and groups it.
    *   `name=""specialty_partition_group""`: Assigns a name to these groups, which is crucial for the subsequent ranking step.
    *   `by=(speciality_val)`: Specifies that doctors should be grouped by their specialty (`speciality_val`).

3.  `result = doctors_partitioned.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step operates on the doctors within each `specialty_partition_group`. The `.Doctors` part accesses the individual doctor records within the current partition.
    *   `doc_id = doc_id_val`: Outputs the doctor's ID.

4.  **Partition Data**: We partition the treatments by the extracted `treatment_year_for_grouping` and `treatment_month_for_grouping`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month and year.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each month-year group, we count the number of unique patients who received a treatment (and thus a diagnosis, as treatments link patients to diagnoses). This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each month-year group, we count the total number of treatments. This is calculated using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
6.  **Format and Order**: The results are ordered by year and month. We then format a `year_month_str` string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") for readability and select the final PMPD and PMTC values.

1.  **Identify First Treatment Year for Each Patient**: For each patient, we find the earliest start date of any treatment they received. The year of this date is considered the year they became a ""new patient"". We filter out patients who have never received any treatment.
2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: We group the patients by their ""first treatment year"" and count how many unique patients fall into each year. This gives us the number of new patients for each year.
3.  **Order by Year**: The yearly counts of new patients are then ordered chronologically by year. This is necessary for the next step, which involves comparing with the previous year.
4.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI (New Patients Increase) is calculated as the number of new patients in the current year minus the number of new patients in the previous year. For the earliest year in the dataset (which has no preceding year), the NPI will be equal to the number of new patients in that year (assuming zero new patients before that).

Here's the PyDough code:

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`: This line starts with the `Patients` collection. It filters out patients who have no treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`. Then, for each remaining patient, it calculates `year_of_first_treatment` by finding the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` among all their `treatments_received` and extracting the year from that date.
2.  `new_patients_by_year`: This takes `patient_first_treatment_info` and partitions it by `year_of_first_treatment`. For each year group, it calculates:
    *   `year_val`: The year of the group.
    *   `num_new_patients_val`: The count of patients whose first treatment occurred in `year_val`. `COUNT(Patients)` counts the items (which originated from the `Patients` collection) within each partition.
3.  `ordered_new_patients_by_year`: This sorts the `new_patients_by_year` collection in ascending order based on `year_val`. This chronological ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function used in the next step.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` step produces the desired output:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `number_of_new_patients`: The count of new patients in that year.
    *   `NPI`: The New Patients Increase. This is calculated by subtracting the previous year's `num_new_patients_val` (obtained using `PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's `num_new_patients_val`.

1.  **Identify Relevant Outcomes**: Filter the `Outcomes` collection to include only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. This ensures that we only consider treatments/patients for whom both data points are available.
2.  **Calculate Average PASI Scores**: From this filtered set of outcomes, calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` and the average `day100_pasi_score` across all included records.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `relevant_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))`
    *   This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. It creates a temporary collection named `relevant_outcomes` containing only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. This fulfills the requirement that only patients with scores for both timepoints are included.

2.  `average_pasi_scores_calc = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`

    *   `avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(relevant_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `relevant_outcomes`.
    *   `avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(relevant_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `relevant_outcomes`.
    *   The result, `average_pasi_scores_calc`, is a collection with a single row containing these two average values.

3.  `overall_d7d100pir_result = average_pasi_scores_calc.CALCULATE(...)`
    *   This line takes the result from the previous step (`average_pasi_scores_calc`) and calculates the final D7D100PIR.
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = IFF(avg_pasi_d7 != 0, (avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0, None)`:

        *   `IFF(avg_pasi_d7 != 0, ..., None)` checks if `avg_pasi_d7` is not zero. If it is zero, the expression returns `None` to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, it computes the percentage.

Return the distinct states.,"WITH doctor_treatment AS (SELECT d.doc_id, d.loc_state FROM doctors AS d JOIN treatments AS t ON d.doc_id = t.doc_id JOIN drugs AS dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE dr.drug_type = 'biologic') SELECT DISTINCT loc_state FROM doctor_treatment;",DermTreatment,"To identify the distinct states where doctors who have prescribed 'Biologic' drugs reside, we can follow these steps:

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have prescribed at least one treatment where the associated drug's `drug_type` is 'Biologic'. This can be achieved using the `HAS` function in conjunction with a `WHERE` clause on the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection, checking the `drug.drug_type`.
3.  From this filtered list of doctors, we need to find the distinct states (`loc_state`). We can use the `PARTITION` method, grouping by `loc_state`.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select the distinct state names.

```python
# Filter doctors who have prescribed treatments involving 'Biologic' drugs
doctors_prescribing_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(
    HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1

distinct_doctor_states = doctors_prescribing_biologics.PARTITION(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_prescribing_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1)`:
    *   We start with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1` checks if a doctor has at least one entry in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection that satisfies the inner condition.
    *   The inner condition `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')` filters the treatments to only those where the `drug_type` of the associated `drug` is 'Biologic'.
    *   So, this line selects all doctors who have prescribed at least one 'Biologic' drug.

2.  `distinct_doctor_states = doctors_prescribing_biologics.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state).CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)`:
    *   We take the `doctors_prescribing_biologics` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state)` groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. This effectively creates groups for each unique state.
    *   `.CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)` then creates a new collection where each row represents one of these unique states, with the column `doctor_state` containing the name of the state.

1.  Filter the `Treatments` collection for records where the `end_dt` falls within the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered treatments, we need to access the patient's insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) to use as a partitioning key. We'll create a temporary calculated field for this.

**Explanation:**

1.  `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type`: This line starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)` filters these treatments to include only those that ended in the year 2022.
    *   `.CALCULATE(derived_ins_type = patient.ins_type)` creates a new temporary field `derived_ins_type` for each treatment, which holds the insurance type of the patient associated with that treatment. This field is necessary for partitioning in the next step.

2.  `partitioned_by_insurance`: This takes the previously prepared `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(derived_ins_type))` groups the treatments based on the `derived_ins_type`. Each group (partition) will contain all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.

3.  `insurance_type_metrics`: This operates on the `partitioned_by_insurance` data.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes aggregate values for each insurance type group:
        *   `insurance_type = derived_ins_type`:  This selects the insurance type (which was the partition key) for the output, renaming it to `insurance_type`.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: This calculates the average `day100_pasi_score`. The `AVG` function operates on all `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: This counts the number of unique patient IDs among the treatments in the current insurance type group.

4.  `top_5_insurance_types_by_pasi`: This takes the `insurance_type_metrics`.

1.  Define a date variable, `var_start_date_limit`, representing the first day of the calendar month that was 6 months prior to the current month. This will be used to filter treatments.
2.  Create an intermediate collection `treatments_with_specialty_and_date_filter`. This starts with the `Treatments` collection, filters for treatments where `start_dt` is on or after `var_start_date_limit`, and calculates the `doctor.speciality` for each of these treatments, naming it `calculated_specialty`.
3.  Partition `treatments_with_specialty_and_date_filter` by `calculated_specialty`. This groups the filtered treatments by doctor specialty.
4.  For each specialty group in the partition, calculate:
    *   `output_specialty`: The name of the specialty (which is `calculated_specialty`).
    *   `output_num_treatments`: The count of treatments within this specialty group. This is achieved by `COUNT(Treatments)`, which counts the `Treatments` records that satisfy both the initial date filter and belong to the current specialty partition.
    *   `output_total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within this specialty group. This is achieved by `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`, which sums the `tot_drug_amt` from `Treatments` records satisfying the same conditions.
5.  From the resulting `specialty_aggregated_data`, select the top 3 specialties using `TOP_K(3, by=output_total_drug_amount.DESC())`.
6.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `specialty`, `number_of_treatments`, and `total_drug_amount`.

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `Patients` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the patients into groups based on their `ins_type`. Each group will represent a unique insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
        *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` and rename it to `insurance_type` for clarity in the output.
        *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that specific insurance type group.
        *   `avg_weight_kg=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Similarly, we calculate the average `weight_kg` for patients within that insurance type group.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, we take the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of insurance types with their average heights and weights).

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, calculate:
    *   `drug_name_val`: The name of the drug, derived from the `drug_name` field.
    *   `num_treatments_val`: The total number of treatments associated with the drug. This is obtained by counting the records in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
    *   `avg_drug_amount_val`: The average total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) across all treatments associated with the drug. This is calculated using the `AVG` aggregation function on `treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments_val.DESC())` function to select the 5 drugs that have the highest number of treatments. The sorting is done in descending order of `num_treatments_val`.
4.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` operation to select and rename the fields for the output:
    *   `drug_name`: The name of the drug.
    *   `num_treatments`: The total number of treatments for that drug.
    *   `average_drug_amount`: The calculated average drug amount per treatment for that drug.

This approach prioritizes drugs by the number of treatments for the ""top 5"" selection, as it's the first criterion mentioned and `TOP_K`'s `by` parameter in the reference typically takes a single expression.

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to calculate a single aggregate value.
2.  **`num_treatments = COUNT(...)`**: We are counting the number of treatments that satisfy the specified conditions and assigning it to the field `num_treatments`.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Treatments` collection based on a series of conditions combined with logical AND (`&`).
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition checks the diagnosis associated with each treatment.
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment.
        *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Performs a wildcard search, matching if 'psoriasis' is a substring of the lowercase diagnosis name.
    *   **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This condition ensures the drug used in the treatment is FDA-approved.
        *   `drug.fda_appr_dt`: Accesses the FDA approval date of the drug linked to the treatment.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the `fda_appr_dt` field is present and not null, implying the drug has an FDA approval date.
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   **`end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`**: This condition checks if the treatment's end date (`end_dt`) is within the last 6 months.
        *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
        *   The treatment must have ended on or after this calculated date.
    *   **`end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`**: This ensures the treatment end date is not in the future, effectively meaning it ended on or before the current moment.

**Explanation:**

*   We start by querying the `AdverseEvents` collection.
*   The `WHERE` clause filters these events based on their timing relative to the treatment start date:
    *   `treatment.start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` field of the `Treatments` record associated with the adverse event.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)` calculates the number of full days between the treatment start date and the adverse event's reported date.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt) >= 1)` ensures the adverse event occurred at least one full day *after* the treatment started.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt) <= 10)` ensures the adverse event occurred no more than 10 full days after the treatment started.
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only events meeting both criteria are included.

For these identified treatments, the query should return the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates for *all* concomitant medications associated with these treatments (not just the ones meeting the two-week condition).

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Define the Date Condition**: A contextless expression `med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment` is defined. This condition checks if a concomitant medication's `start_dt` is on or after the parent treatment's `start_dt` and no more than 14 days after it. `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the medication's start and the treatment's start.
2.  **Select Qualifying Treatments**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is filtered first for `is_placebo == True`.
    *   It's further filtered using `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment)) == 1`. This ensures that only treatments having at least one concomitant medication satisfying the defined date condition are selected. The result is stored in `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`.
3.  **Retrieve Desired Information**:
    *   From `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`, we navigate to their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This will include *all* concomitant medications for the selected treatments.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function is then used to specify the output fields:
        *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the treatment (from the parent `Treatments` record).
        *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the treatment.
        *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the treatment.
        *   `med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from the current `ConcomitantMeds` record).
        *   `med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

This approach ensures that if a placebo treatment meets the criteria (having at least one med starting within 2 weeks), then all of its concomitant medications are listed along with the treatment details.

    *   `distinct_transactions_count`: The number of distinct successful transactions. This is found by filtering the merchant's `transactions_received` for those with `status == ""completed""`, then counting the distinct `txid`.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, compute the `CPUR` by dividing `distinct_coupons_count` by `distinct_transactions_count`.
4.  Use the `IFF` function to handle cases where `distinct_transactions_count` is zero (to prevent division by zero), defaulting `CPUR` to `0.0` in such instances.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_context`: We start by calculating `current_week_start_ts` (the timestamp for the beginning of the current week) at the `Ewallet` (graph) level. This provides a stable reference for date calculations.
2.  `notifications_with_week_info`:
    *   We access `Users` and filter for those in the ""US"" or ""CA"".
    *   Then, we access their `notifications`.
    *   For each notification, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start date of the week the notification was created, effectively truncating `created_at` to the week.
        *   `is_weekend_notification_flag`: A flag (1 if true, 0 if false) indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME()`.
        *   `num_weeks_ago`: The difference in full weeks between the notification's week and the `current_week_start_ts`.
3.  `relevant_notifications_for_period`: We filter the above results to keep only notifications where `num_weeks_ago` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_notification_summary` (assigned to `result`):
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_notifications_for_period` by `notification_actual_week_start`. This groups notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for which the counts are being reported.
        *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications sent in that week (achieved by `COUNT(Notifications)` within the partition group).
        *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications sent on a weekend during that week (achieved by `SUM(is_weekend_notification_flag)` over the items in the partition group).

1.  Filter the `Users` collection to select only users whose `country` is ""US"".
2.  Access the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for these US users. These represent transactions made by them.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`. This condition means the difference in days between the transaction's creation date (`created_at`) and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`) must be 6 days or less. This covers today (0 days diff) and the 6 preceding days, totaling 7 days.
4.  Calculate the total count of these filtered transactions using `COUNT()`.
5.  Calculate the sum of the `amount` for these filtered transactions using `SUM()`.
6.  The results are presented as `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount` using a `CALCULATE` operation on the top-level `Ewallet` collection.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.

3.  Within each user's set of balances, identify the most recent one. This can be done by ranking the balances based on the `updated_at` field in descending order. The balance record with rank 1 will be the latest.
4.  Extract the `balance` amount from this latest record.
5.  The final result should include the user's identifier (`uid`) and their LUB.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We iterate through each user in the `Users` collection to calculate new fields.
2.  `user_identifier=uid`: For each user, we select their `uid` and name it `user_identifier`.
3.  `latest_user_balance_value=...`: We define a new field `latest_user_balance_value`.
    *   `balances`: This accesses the list of `UserBalances` associated with the current user.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:

        *   `== 1`: We filter these ranked balances to keep only the one(s) with rank 1 (i.e., the most recent).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since we expect only one ""most recent"" balance per user (or `RANKING` will pick one if ties exist with default `allow_ties=False`), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of the `WHERE` clause as a single record.

    *   `.SINGULAR()`: This function is used because, after filtering by rank, we expect at most one snapshot per user (the latest one). It allows us to treat this sub-collection record as a singular item in the subsequent `CALCULATE` step.

2.  `result = Users.CALCULATE(user_id=uid, opt_in_preference=latest_setting_snapshot_for_user.marketing_opt_in)`:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition (`ewallet_context_vars`):**
    *   `calc_start_of_target_period`: Determines the start date for transactions. It's set to the first day of the month that is two months before the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be May 1st).
    *   `calc_end_of_target_period`: Determines the end date (exclusive). It's set to the first day of the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be July 1st, so transactions up to June 30th are included).
    *   This ensures the query considers transactions from the last two full months, excluding the current month.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`filtered_transactions`):**
    *   Selects transactions from the `Ewallet.Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters for transactions where `sender_type == 0`, as specified for active users.
    *   Applies the date range calculated in the previous step (`created_at >= calc_start_of_target_period` and `created_at < calc_end_of_target_period`).

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`transactions_for_monthly_aggregation`):**
    *   From the filtered transactions, it extracts the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of `created_at` into `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This effectively ""truncates created_at to month for aggregation.""
    *   `sender_id` is aliased to `user_sender_id` for clarity.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`):**
    *   The prepared transaction data is partitioned by `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This groups all transaction records by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `pmdau_year`: The year of the report.
        *   `pmdau_month`: The month of the report.
        *   `pmdau_value`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(user_sender_id)`. This count represents the number of unique users (senders with `sender_type = 0`) who were active (made at least one transaction) during that specific month.

5.  **Result:**
    *   The final output (`result`) will contain rows for each of the two target months, with the corresponding year, month, and the calculated PMDAU value (which, by this interpretation, is the count of unique active senders in that month).",101.31816959381104,"# Define date boundaries globally.

1.  Filter the `UserSessions` collection to include only sessions that started on or after `2023-06-01T00:00:00` and before `2023-06-08T00:00:00`.
2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We also need to retain the `user_id` for grouping.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `user_id`.
4.  For each user group, calculate the sum of all their session durations to get the total session duration for that user.
5.  Select the `user_id` and this total session duration.
6.  Order the final result by the total session duration in descending order.

The `user_id` from the `UserSessions` table will be used as the user identifier. The duration will be an integer as `DATEDIFF` returns an integer and `SUM` of integers is an integer.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable holds sessions that fall within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_duration_seconds` (the duration of that single session in seconds) and keeps `session_user_id` (the `user_id` associated with the session).
2.  `user_total_session_durations`: This takes `sessions_with_duration` and groups them by `session_user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each unique user), it calculates:
    *   `user_id_output`: This is the `user_id` for the group.
    *   `total_duration_output`: This is the sum of `calculated_duration_seconds` for all sessions belonging to that user within the filtered range. The `UserSessions.calculated_duration_seconds` refers to the `calculated_duration_seconds` field of the records within each partition group, which originated from the `UserSessions` collection.
3.  `final_result`: This sorts the `user_total_session_durations` by `total_duration_output` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.

1.  **Determine the ""previous month""**: We'll use the `DATETIME` function to get the current date, then find the start of the current month, and subtract one month to get the start of the previous month. From this, we extract the year and month.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll filter all transactions that occurred within the determined previous month.
    *   **Assumption for ""wallet transactions""**: The query assumes that all transactions in the `Transactions` collection are considered ""wallet transactions"". If ""wallet transactions"" refer to a specific `transaction_type` (e.g., `transaction_type == 'WALLET'`), this condition would need to be added to the transaction filters.
3.  **Count Successful Transactions**: We'll count the transactions from the previous month that were successful.
    *   **Assumption for ""successful transaction""**: A transaction is considered successful if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`.
4.  **Count Total Transactions**: We'll count all transactions from the previous month.
5.  **Calculate STR**: STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`. We'll also handle the case where the total number of transactions is zero to prevent division by zero, returning 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation of the code:**

1.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)` block determines the target year (`_prev_month_target_year`) and month (`_prev_month_target_month`) corresponding to the ""previous month"" relative to the current date.
2.  The second `.CALCULATE(...)` block uses these date parameters to:
    *   Count `_num_successful_transactions_prev_month`: It filters the `Transactions` collection for records where the `created_at` date falls within the target previous month and the `status` is ""completed"".
    *   Count `_num_total_transactions_prev_month`: It filters the `Transactions` collection for all records where the `created_at` date falls within the target previous month.
3.  The third and final `.CALCULATE(...)` block computes the `previous_month_str`. It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_num_total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than zero.
    *   If true, it calculates STR as `(_num_successful_transactions_prev_month * 100.0) / _num_total_transactions_prev_month` (as a percentage).
    *   If false (i.e., no transactions in the previous month), it returns `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_creation_date_parts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   It calculates `merchant_creation_year_field` (the year the merchant was created) and `merchant_creation_month_field` (the month the merchant was created) for each merchant.
    *   It also carries forward the merchant's `mid` and `name` under temporary names (`merchant_id_temp`, `merchant_name_temp`).

2.  `merchants_with_coupon_counts = merchants_with_creation_date_parts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step takes the records from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using a `WHERE` clause:
            *   `YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation year matches the merchant's creation year.
            *   `MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation month matches the merchant's creation month.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are passed through as `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val`.

3.  `top_merchant_details = merchants_with_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:
    *   This step takes the merchants along with their respective counts of coupons created in their creation month.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. If there's a tie, one of the top merchants will be chosen.

4.  `result = top_merchant_details.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This final step takes the record of the top merchant.

    )

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
    *   `LOWER(country) == 'us'`: This condition filters users whose country is 'US', ignoring case (e.g., 'us', 'US', 'Us' will all match).
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition ensures that the user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: We look into the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`: This filters the notifications to include only those that are 'promotional' and 'unread'.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This checks if there is at least one such notification for the user.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only users from the US *and* having relevant notifications are selected.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the users who passed the filter, we calculate the desired output fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table. It selects transactions that:
    *   Occurred in 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   Were initiated by a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
    *   Were successful (`status == ""successful""`).
    *   Were sent by a user who is currently marked as active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
2.  `transactions_with_month_and_user_id`: This `CALCULATE` step processes the `filtered_transactions`. For each transaction, it:
    *   Derives `transaction_month_asat_date` by taking the `created_at` timestamp and truncating it to the start of its month (e.g., ""2023-01-15 10:00:00"" becomes ""2023-01-01 00:00:00""). This provides a consistent date value for each month.
    *   Extracts `sender_user_uid` which is the `uid` of the `sending_user`. This ID will be used for counting distinct users.
3.  `monthly_distinct_active_users`: This is the core aggregation step.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_sends"", by=(transaction_month_asat_date))` groups the records from `transactions_with_month_and_user_id` based on the `transaction_month_asat_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., each month).
        *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_asat_date`: Selects the month (which is the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(transactions_with_month_and_user_id.sender_user_uid)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_user_uid` values within that month's group. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
4.  `result`: This line orders the `monthly_distinct_active_users` by `month_as_date` in ascending order, so the earliest month appears first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the sessions into groups based on the `device_type`. Each group will contain all sessions for a specific device type. The `name=""device_groups""` assigns a name to these partitioned groups, though it's not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` in this specific query structure.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(device_type=device_type, session_count=COUNT(UserSessions))`**:
    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` (i.e., for each unique `device_type`):
        *   We select the `device_type` itself.
        *   We calculate `session_count` by counting the number of `UserSessions` within that group using `COUNT(UserSessions)`.

3.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=session_count.DESC())`**:

    *   The merchant's `category` (converted to lowercase) must contain the substring 'retail'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the category.
2.  **Access Balances**: For these filtered merchants, we access their associated balance records through the `balances` sub-collection. This gives us a collection of `MerchantBalances` records.
3.  **Filter Balances by Update Date**: We then filter these `MerchantBalances` records to include only those that were `updated_at` today. This is done by comparing the date part of `updated_at` (truncated to the start of the day) with the current date (also truncated to the start of the day).
4.  **Calculate Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the `MEDIAN` of the `balance` field from these filtered, today-updated balance records. This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single result representing the overall median.

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To determine the average user session duration in seconds, split by device type, we need to perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `UserSessions` collection.
2.  For each session, calculate its duration in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts`.
3.  Group the sessions by `device_type` using the `PARTITION` function.
4.  For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the session durations.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select the device_type.
# We rename device_type to 'current_device_type' in this intermediate calculation
# to clearly distinguish it as the field we will partition by.
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    current_device_type=device_type,
    duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)
)

# Step 2: Partition the sessions by 'current_device_type'.
# Then, for each group, calculate the device_type and the average session duration.
result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(
    name=""sessions_by_device_group"",  # Name for the groups created by partition
    by=(current_device_type)         # The key to partition by (from sessions_with_duration)
).CALCULATE(
    device_type=current_device_type, # Output the device type (using the partition key)
    avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds) # Calculate average of the 'duration_seconds' field
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create a new representation of the data.
    *   `current_device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` and assigns it to a new field named `current_device_type`. This is used as the partitioning key.
    *   `duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in a new field called `duration_seconds`.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_by_device_group"", by=(current_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `current_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_by_device_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type=current_device_type, avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds))`: This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
        *   `device_type=current_device_type`: Includes the `device_type` (which is the partitioning key `current_device_type`) in the final output.
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_seconds` field (which was computed in the first `CALCULATE` step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. The `AVG` function will operate on the `duration_seconds` values from the `sessions_with_duration` collection, scoped to the current partition.

The final `result` will contain one record for each `device_type`, showing the `device_type` and its corresponding `avg_session_duration_seconds`.",55.28612518310547,"# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select the device_type.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter out merchants who do not have any coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, use a `CALCULATE` operation to determine:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `temp_merchant_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `temp_registration_date`.
    *   The ID (`cid`) of their earliest coupon as `temp_earliest_coupon_cid`. This is found by taking the merchant's `coupons`, selecting the top 1 ordered by `start_date` in ascending order (`TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`), making it a singular record (`SINGULAR()`), and then accessing its `cid`.
    *   The start date (`start_date`) of their earliest coupon as `temp_earliest_coupon_start_date`, using a similar approach.
4.  Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these records further. The condition ensures that the `temp_earliest_coupon_start_date` is:
    *   Greater than or equal to the `temp_registration_date`.
    *   Less than or equal to one year after the `temp_registration_date`. The date one year later is calculated using `DATETIME(temp_registration_date, '1 year')`.
5.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` operation to select the required fields and assign them their final names: `merchant_id`, `registration_date`, `earliest_coupon_id`, and `earliest_coupon_start_date`.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we need to determine the date that is exactly one year after their `created_at` date. This can be done using the `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')` function.
3.  We then filter the `notifications` sub-collection for each user to find any notifications that were created *before* this one-year mark (`notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`).
4.  The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check if the result of this filtered notification sub-collection is empty. If it's empty, it means the user did not receive any notifications within their first year.
5.  Users who satisfy this condition are selected.
6.  Finally, for these selected users, we retrieve their `username`, `email`, and their original `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`).

Explanation:
-   `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
-   `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1`: This is the main condition for filtering users.
    -   `notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`: For each user, this part filters their `notifications`. It selects notifications whose `created_at` timestamp is earlier than one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp.
        -   `notifications.created_at`: Refers to the creation date of a notification.
        -   `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`: Calculates the date one year after the user's signup date (`Users.created_at`).
    -   `HASNOT(...) == 1`: This checks if the filtered collection of notifications (those received within the first year) is empty. If it is empty, the user is included in the result.
-   `.CALCULATE(username=username, email=email, signup_date=created_at)`: For the users who meet the criteria, this selects their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date (which is their signup date, aliased here as `signup_date`).",46.24016857147217,"users_without_first_year_notification = Users.WHERE(
