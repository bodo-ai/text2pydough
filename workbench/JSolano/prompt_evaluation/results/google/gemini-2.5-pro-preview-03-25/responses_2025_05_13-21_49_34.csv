1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter out customers who have no transactions using `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`. This ensures we only process customers with transaction data.
3.  Calculate the total number of transactions and the number of successful transactions for each customer. A transaction is assumed to be successful if its `status` field is ""Completed"". These will be stored as `total_transactions_count` and `successful_transactions_count` respectively. The customer's name is also selected and stored as `c_name`.
4.  Filter these results to include only customers who have 5 or more total transactions (`WHERE(total_transactions_count >= 5)`).
5.  For the filtered customers, calculate the `success_rate` as `(successful_transactions_count * 100.0) / total_transactions_count`. We select the customer's name (as `customer_name`) and this calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Finally, order the results by `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"".
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
4.  Count the number of distinct customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will be a global aggregation, so we'll use `Broker.CALCULATE`.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

# Calculate the number of distinct customers meeting the criteria
result = Broker.CALCULATE(

            ) == 1
        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple holding the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression used for clarity and reusability.
2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We use `Broker.CALCULATE` because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of such customers) from the entire dataset.
3.  `num_distinct_customers = COUNT(...)`: This calculates the desired count and assigns it to the field `num_distinct_customers`.
4.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Customers` collection.
5.  `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This is the first condition, ensuring that the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
6.  `&`: This logical AND operator combines the email condition with the transaction condition.
7.  `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`: This is the second condition.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1` checks if a customer has at least one record in the sub-collection specified within the `HAS` function.
    *   `transactions_made` refers to the list of transactions associated with each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))` filters these transactions. It checks if the `symbol` of the `ticker` associated with a transaction is present in our `faang_tickers` list. `ISIN` is used here to check for an exact match against the provided list of ticker symbols.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: Calculate the start date of the current week and the start date of the week 8 weeks prior. This defines our 8-week window of interest.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   Select transactions related to 'stock' tickers.
    *   For each transaction, determine the starting date of the week it occurred in.
    *   For each transaction, create a flag (1 if it occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday), 0 otherwise).
3.  **Filter by Time Window**: Keep only those transactions whose week start date falls within our 8-week window (i.e., greater than or equal to the start of the 8th week ago, and less than the start of the current week).
4.  **Group by Week**: Partition the filtered transactions by their calculated week start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by calculating two key dates:
    *   `limit_start_date_inclusive_val`: The start date of the week that was exactly 8 weeks ago. This marks the beginning of our period of interest.
    *   `limit_end_date_exclusive_val`: The start date of the current week. Transactions must be before this date to exclude the current week.
2.  `transactions_with_week_info = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We access the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(ticker.ticker_type == 'stock')`: Filters transactions to include only those associated with tickers of type 'stock'.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each stock transaction, we derive two new pieces of information:
        *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred, using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
        *   `is_weekend_indicator`: A flag set to 1 if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday (using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`), and 0 otherwise.
3.  `relevant_time_transactions = transactions_with_week_info.WHERE(...)`:
    *   This step filters the prepared transactions to include only those falling within our target 8-week window. The conditions ensure that `transaction_week_start_dt` is on or after `limit_start_date_inclusive_val` and strictly before `limit_end_date_exclusive_val`.
4.  `weekly_stock_data = relevant_time_transactions.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_stock_group"", by=(transaction_week_start_dt))`: Groups the `relevant_time_transactions` by their `transaction_week_start_dt`. Each group represents a unique week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group, we calculate:
        *   `week_identifier`: The start date of the week (this is the partition key).
        *   `total_transactions_for_stocks`: The total count of stock transactions within that week, using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_transactions_for_stocks`: The count of stock transactions that occurred on a weekend within that week, by summing the `is_weekend_indicator` flags (`SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_indicator)`).
5.  `final_stock_report = weekly_stock_data.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_identifier` in descending order, so the most recent week (from the 8-week period) appears first.

    *   Calculate the start of last week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week: `DATETIME(start_of_current_week_expr, '-7 days')`.
    Transactions from ""last week"" will have a `date_time` greater than or equal to the start of last week and less than the start of the current week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:

3.  **Aggregate Results**:

    *   Sum the `amount` of these filtered transactions using `SUM()`.

These calculations will be performed starting from the `Broker` high-level collection to establish the date boundaries, which are then used in the aggregation over the `Transactions` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(_calc_start_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week'))`: This first `CALCULATE` call on the `Broker` (the top-level graph object) defines a variable `_calc_start_current_week`. This variable holds the timestamp for the beginning of the current week.

2.  `.CALCULATE(_calc_start_last_week = DATETIME(_calc_start_current_week, '-7 days'))`: The second chained `CALCULATE` uses the `_calc_start_current_week` from the previous step to determine `_calc_start_last_week`. This variable holds the timestamp for the beginning of last week.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The final `CALCULATE` performs the main aggregation:
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(...))`: It counts transactions from the `Transactions` collection that meet the specified criteria:
        *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: The customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
        *   `(date_time >= _calc_start_last_week) & (date_time < _calc_start_current_week)`: The transaction's `date_time` falls within last week (from the start of last week up to, but not including, the start of the current week).
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.WHERE(...).amount)`: It sums the `amount` field of the same set of filtered transactions.

The result, `transactions_summary_last_week_usa`, will be a single-row collection containing the total number of transactions and their total amount for USA customers last week.",46.41606283187866,"transactions_summary_last_week_usa = Broker.CALCULATE(

result = ranked_customer_data
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_metrics = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer by counting the records in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer.

2.  **`ranked_customer_data = customer_transaction_metrics.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We take the output from the previous step (`customer_transaction_metrics`).
    *   Another `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Carry over the `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` fields.
        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the rank for each customer.
            *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank.
            *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1).

3.  **`result = ranked_customer_data`**:
    *   The final result, containing the customer's name, their number of transactions, their total transaction amount, and their rank (CR), is assigned to the `result` variable.",15.309537887573242,"# Calculate basic transaction metrics for each customer

    *   `has_txn_flag`: True if the customer has made any transactions (i.e., `transactions_made` is not empty).
3.  We will then partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country partition:

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022`: This variable stores customers who joined in 2022. We also calculate `customer_country_field` (renaming `country` for partitioning), `is_active_customer_flag` (True if `status` is 'active'), and `has_transactions_flag` (True if the customer has any transactions).
2.  `country_aggregated_data`: We partition the `customers_joined_2022` data by `customer_country_field`. For each country:
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions`: Counts customers within that country partition (who joined in 2022) where both `is_active_customer_flag` and `has_transactions_flag` are true.
    *   `total_customers_with_transactions`: Counts customers within that country partition (who joined in 2022) where `has_transactions_flag` is true.
    *   `output_country_name` stores the country name from the partition key.
3.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the Activity Ratio (`AR`).
    *   It uses the formula `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
    *   `IFF(total_customers_with_transactions > 0, ..., 0.0)` handles the case where there are no customers with transactions in a country (to avoid division by zero), setting AR to `0.0`.

1.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select transactions that are of type ""sell"" and occurred within the last month. The date range is from exactly one month ago up to the current moment.
2.  **Prepare Data for Aggregation**: For these filtered transactions, we'll extract the ticker symbol, the transaction amount (as `sell_amount`), and combine tax and commission into `sell_costs`.
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: We'll use `PARTITION` to group these transactions by their ticker symbol.
4.  **Aggregate Financials**: Within each ticker group, we'll calculate `total_sell_amount` (sum of `sell_amount`) and `total_sell_costs_combined` (sum of `sell_costs`).
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the provided formula `SPM = (Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`, we'll compute the SPM for each ticker. We'll handle cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero to prevent division by zero errors, assigning an SPM of 0.0 in such instances. Floating-point arithmetic is used for precision.
6.  **Format Output**: The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `spm`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `monthly_sell_transactions`: This variable stores transactions that are of type ""sell"" and have a `date_time` falling between one month ago (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`) and the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`). For each of these transactions, we also calculate `ticker_sym_val` (the ticker's symbol), `transaction_amount` (the transaction's `amount`), and `transaction_costs` (the sum of `tax` and `commission`).
2.  `ticker_level_aggregates`: We then partition `monthly_sell_transactions` by `ticker_sym_val`. For each unique ticker symbol, we calculate `output_ticker_symbol` (which is the ticker symbol itself), `total_sell_amount` (the sum of all `transaction_amount` for that ticker), and `total_sell_costs_combined` (the sum of all `transaction_costs` for that ticker).
3.  `result`: Finally, using the aggregated values, we calculate the `spm` (Selling Profit Margin) for each `ticker_symbol`. The formula applied is `(total_sell_amount - total_sell_costs_combined) * 100.0 / total_sell_amount`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero, setting `spm` to `0.0` to avoid division by zero errors. The multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage in floating-point format. The output contains only the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding `spm`. Tickers with no 'sell' transactions in the specified period will not be included in the result.",70.05422568321228,"# Step 1: Filter 'sell' transactions from the past month and prepare necessary fields.

1.  **Prepare Price Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, calculate the ticker's symbol, the year, the month, and a formatted year-month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"").
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Group the prepared data by ticker symbol and the formatted year-month string. For each group (i.e., for each ticker for each month), calculate:
    *   Average closing price.
    *   Highest price (using the `high` field).
    *   Lowest price (using the `low` field).
    This results in a collection where each row represents a ticker's performance for a specific month.
3.  **Prepare for MoMC Calculation**: Re-partition the above monthly aggregated data by ticker symbol. This creates groups where each group contains all monthly records for a single ticker. This step is crucial for correctly applying the `PREV` window function, which needs to operate ""per ticker"".
4.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: Within each ticker's group of monthly records, use the `PREV` window function to find the average closing price of the *previous* month. The records are ordered by year and month to determine the correct preceding record. If a month is the first one for a ticker, there will be no previous month data.
5.  **Calculate MoMC and Finalize Output**: Using the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price (obtained in the previous step), calculate the MoMC. The formula is: `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`. Handle cases where previous month data is unavailable or the previous average close is zero to avoid errors.
6.  **Select and Order**: Select the required fields: ticker symbol, month (YYYY-MM), average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC. Finally, order the results by ticker symbol and then by month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each ticker. For each `ticker`, we retrieve its `symbol` (aliased as `ticker_sym_val`) and filter its `historical_prices` to get only the records within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"".

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(c_state=customer.state, t_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to create two new fields for each transaction:
        *   `c_state`: Stores the state of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.state`).
        *   `t_type`: Stores the type of the ticker associated with the transaction (`ticker.ticker_type`).

2.  `combinations_by_transactions = transaction_info.PARTITION(name=""state_type_groups"", by=(c_state, t_type)).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the `transaction_info` (which has `c_state` and `t_type` for each transaction).
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_type_groups"", by=(c_state, t_type))`: Groups the transactions based on unique combinations of `c_state` and `t_type`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=c_state, ticker_type=t_type, number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination) created by the partition:
        *   `customer_state=c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `ticker_type=t_type`: Selects the ticker type for the group.
        *   `number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions belonging to this specific combination of customer state and ticker type.

3.  `top_5_combinations_by_transactions = combinations_by_transactions.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the `combinations_by_transactions` (which contains each unique state-type combination and its transaction count).

**Explanation:**

1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.

3.  Further filter these records to include only those where the `date` falls within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) < 7` for this, which means the difference in days between the record's date and the current date is less than 7 (covering today and the 6 previous days).
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, calculate the minimum `close` price.
5.  Assign this minimum value to a descriptive variable.

)
```
**Explanation:**

*   `vti_prices_last_7_days = Broker.DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing all `DailyPrices` from the `Broker` collection. It then applies two filter conditions using `WHERE`:
    *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This ensures we only consider price records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. We access the symbol through the `ticker` relationship from `DailyPrices` to the `Tickers` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) < 7`: This condition filters for records from the ""past 7 days"". `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time. `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment. By checking if this difference is less than 7, we include records from today and the 6 preceding days.
*   `lowest_vti_close_past_7_days = Broker.CALCULATE(min_close_price = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close))`: This line calculates the final result.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Filters these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction. The `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` condition checks if the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which is a list of transactions for each customer) is not empty.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`** (first `CALCULATE`):
    *   This step processes each customer who passed the filter.
    *   `original_customer_id = _id`: Stores the customer's original `_id` into a new field `original_customer_id`.
    *   `customer_join_date = join_date`: Stores the customer's `join_date` into `customer_join_date`.
    *   `date_of_first_transaction = MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: For each customer, this calculates the minimum (i.e., earliest) `date_time` from their `transactions_made` sub-collection. This effectively finds the date of their first transaction.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`** (second `CALCULATE`):
    *   This step takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` and computes the final output fields.
    *   `_id = original_customer_id`: Selects the customer's ID, renaming it back to `_id` for the final output as requested.
    *   `time_to_first_transaction_days = DATEDIFF(""days"", customer_join_date, date_of_first_transaction)`:
        *   Calculates the difference between the `customer_join_date` and the `date_of_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", ...)` specifies that the difference should be measured in days.
        *   The result is stored in a new field named `time_to_first_transaction_days`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation on the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it will compute the specified new fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: Selects the customer's ID.
    *   `name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `number_of_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(...))`: This calculates the number of relevant transactions for the current customer.
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions associated with the customer.
        *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (YEAR(date_time) == 2023) & (MONTH(date_time) == 4) & (DAY(date_time) == 1))`: Filters these transactions. A transaction is kept if:
            *   Its `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
            *   The `YEAR` of its `date_time` is 2023.
            *   The `MONTH` of its `date_time` is 4 (April).
            *   The `DAY` of its `date_time` is 1.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts how many transactions meet all the above criteria.
2.  `.WHERE(number_of_transactions > 0)`: After calculating `number_of_transactions` for all customers, this step filters the results to include only those customers who made at least one ""sell"" transaction on the specified date.
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`: From the filtered list of customers, this selects the top 1 customer.
    *   `1`: Specifies that we want only one customer.
    *   `by=number_of_transactions.DESC()`: Orders the customers by their `number_of_transactions` in descending order, so the customer with the most transactions comes first. If there's a tie, one of the top customers will be chosen.

The final `result` will be a collection containing at most one customer, with their `_id`, `name`, and the `number_of_transactions` they made that match the criteria.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the first quarter of 2023 (January, February, March) and have a status of ""successful"".
2.  Extract the month from the `date_time` of these filtered transactions.
3.  Group the filtered transactions by the extracted month.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction `price`.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `(YEAR(date_time) == 2023)`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
    *   `(ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3)))`: Ensures transactions are from January (1), February (2), or March (3), covering the first quarter.
    *   `(status == ""successful"")`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, we create a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from the `date_time` field. This new field will be used for grouping.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month))`: We then partition the filtered and augmented transactions into groups based on the `transaction_month`. Each group will represent a month in Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month, average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `month = transaction_month`: We select the `transaction_month` (which is the partition key) and name it `month` in the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: We calculate the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific monthly group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the prices of transactions belonging to the current partition.
5.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Finally, the results are ordered in ascending order by month.",24.519845485687256,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and successful status, and extract the month

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the time window. This involves calculating the start date of the current calendar week and then finding the date 8 weeks prior to that. This defines our 8-week analysis period.
2.  **Filter Sales**: We select sales records where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000.
3.  **Select and Filter Payments**: From these high-value sales, we access their associated payments (`PaymentsReceived`). We then filter these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated 8-week window (i.e., on or after the start of the 8th week ago, and before the start of the current week).
4.  **Augment Payment Data**: For each relevant payment, we calculate two new pieces of information:
    *   `week_start_date_calc`: The start date of the calendar week in which the payment was made. This is achieved using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend_payment_calc`: A boolean flag indicating if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME()` and `ISIN()`.
5.  **Group Payments by Week**: We use the `PARTITION` function to group the augmented payment records by their `week_start_date_calc`.
6.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each weekly group, we calculate:
    *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments received in that week using `COUNT()`.
    *   `weekend_payments_received`: The count of payments received on a weekend in that week. This is done by summing up a conditional expression (`IFF(is_weekend_payment_calc == True, 1, 0)`).
7.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by the week start date in ascending order.

This approach will provide a weekly breakdown of payments as requested, focusing only on weeks within the specified period that had qualifying payment activity.

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection: We select only those cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. The matching for `vin_number` will be case-insensitive and allow partial matches by converting the `vin_number` to lowercase and using the `LIKE` operator with `'%m5%'`.
2.  Partition the filtered cars: The cars that satisfy the VIN condition are then grouped by their `make` and `model`.
3.  Calculate results for each group: For each unique combination of `make` and `model` from the filtered set, we calculate:
    *   `car_make`: The make of the car.
    *   `car_model`: The model of the car.
    *   `num_sales`: The total count of sales records associated with all cars in that specific (make, model) group. This is done using `COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`.

The general instruction ""When using car makes, model names, engine_type and vin_number, match case-insensitively and allow partial matches using LIKE with wildcards"" is applied to the filtering condition on `vin_number`. The grouping by `make` and `model` uses their original values as present in the database, which is the most straightforward interpretation for grouping keys unless specified otherwise for case-insensitivity in grouping.

1.  **Identify Relevant Cars**: Start with the `Cars` collection. For each car, we need to:
    *   Determine its most recent inventory status using the `inventory_snapshots` table. A car is considered ""no longer in inventory"" if its latest snapshot shows `is_in_inventory` as `False`.
    *   Ensure the car has actually been sold by checking if it has associated `sale_records`.

2.  **Collect Sales Data for Relevant Cars**: For the cars that meet the criteria (sold and no longer in inventory), access their `sale_records`. For each sale, we need its `sale_price` and the car's `make` and `model`.

3.  **Aggregate by Make and Model**: Group the collected sales data by car `make` and `model`. For each group, calculate the maximum `sale_price`.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by the calculated highest sale price in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_latest_snapshot`: We start by processing each car in the `Cars` collection. For every car, we retrieve its `make`, `model`, and identify its single most recent `inventory_snapshot` record using `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1` and `SINGULAR()`.
2.  `relevant_cars`: We then filter this collection. A car is kept if:
    *   It has a `latest_snapshot_record` (`HAS(latest_snapshot_record) == 1`).
    *   This snapshot indicates the car is not in inventory (`latest_snapshot_record.is_in_inventory == False`).
    *   The car has been sold, meaning it has associated records in `sale_records` (`HAS(sale_records) == 1`).
3.  `sales_from_relevant_cars`: For each car in `relevant_cars`, we access its `sale_records`. From each sale record, we extract the `sale_price` (as `s_price`), and the `make` and `model` of the car involved in that sale (as `s_car_make` and `s_car_model`).
4.  `grouped_sales_by_make_model`: This step takes all the individual sales from `sales_from_relevant_cars` and groups them using `PARTITION` by `s_car_make` and `s_car_model`. For each unique make/model combination, it calculates the `MAX(s_price)` and names this `highest_sale_price`. The output fields are named `make`, `model`, and `highest_sale_price`.
5.  `final_result`: Finally, the grouped results are ordered by `highest_sale_price` in descending order, showing the make/model combinations with the highest sales first.",105.01201033592224,"# Step 1: For each car, get its make, model, and its latest inventory snapshot record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and then apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `""%ford%""` allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""Alford"", ""Fordson""). `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
3.  **`LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")`**: Similarly, this condition checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"", allowing for case-insensitive partial matches.
4.  **`|`**: The pipe operator acts as a logical OR, so cars matching either the make condition or the model condition (or both) will be included.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use the `CALCULATE` function to specify the output fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(day_difference = DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`**:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment, `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of days between the `sale_date` (from the linked `Sales` record via `sale_record`) and the `payment_date` of the current payment.
    *   The result of this date difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `day_difference`.

2.  **`AVG(...)`**:
    *   The `AVG(...)` function takes the `day_difference` values calculated for all payments and computes their average.

3.  **`ROUND(..., 2)`**:
    *   The `ROUND` function takes the calculated average and rounds it to 2 decimal places, as requested.

4.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(avg_days_to_payment = ...)`**:
    *   This outer `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` (high-level graph) collection is used to produce a single result.

1.  Filter sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales by summing their `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales by summing the `cost` of the cars sold. The `cost` is obtained by navigating from a `Sale` record to its related `Car` record.
4.  Apply the GPM formula using these aggregated totals.
5.  Handle the potential division by zero if the total cost is zero (e.g., if no sales occurred or cars had no cost).

The query will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to aggregate across all relevant sales.

Explanation:
1.  `aggregated_sales_data_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This part of the query operates at the top `Dealership` level.
    *   `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all `Sales` records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023. This gives the total revenue for 2023.
    *   `total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`: It calculates the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales in 2023. `Sales.car` links a sale to its specific car, and `car.cost` provides the cost of that car. This gives the total cost of goods sold for 2023.

2.  `result = aggregated_sales_data_2023.CALCULATE(...)`: This part takes the previously calculated totals and computes the GPM.
    *   `gpm_for_2023_sales = IFF(...)`: This calculates the GPM.
        *   `total_cost_2023 == 0`: It checks if the `total_cost_2023` is zero.
        *   `0.0`: If `total_cost_2023` is zero (meaning no sales with cost, or no sales at all), GPM is set to `0.0` to prevent a division-by-zero error.
        *   `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`: If `total_cost_2023` is not zero, this applies the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`. The `100.0` ensures floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.

The final `result` will be a collection with a single row and a single column `gpm_for_2023_sales`, containing the calculated GPM for all car sales in 2023.",37.307374000549316,"# Calculate total revenue and total cost for sales made in 2023

    *   `car.inventory_snapshots`: Accesses the list of inventory snapshots for the car involved in the current sale.
    *   `.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date))`: This filters the inventory snapshots.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: Ensures we are looking at a snapshot where the car was marked as out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`: Ensures this ""out of inventory"" event happened on the same day as the sale. `Sales.sale_date` refers to the `sale_date` of the specific `Sales` record being evaluated by the outer `WHERE` clause.

4.  `.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`: For the selected top sale, this extracts the `make` and `model` from its associated `car` object and the `sale_price` from the sale record itself.",29.739400386810303,"result = Sales.WHERE(

1.  Extract the year and month from the `payment_date` in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. We'll also ensure that we only process records that have a `payment_date`.
2.  Group these records by the extracted year and month. For each group, calculate the sum of `payment_amount` to get the `total_monthly_payments`.
3.  Order these monthly totals chronologically by year and then by month. This is important for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the previous month's data.
4.  Calculate the MoM (Month-over-Month) change. The MoM change is defined as `(current month value - previous month value)`. We'll use the `PREV` function to get the `total_monthly_payments` from the previous month. If there is no previous month in the data (e.g., for the very first month), the `PREV` function will return `None`, and thus the `mom_change` will also be `None`.

Regarding the requirement ""Return all months in your answer, including those where there were no payments"": This query will include all months for which there are records in the `PaymentsReceived` table. If a month has records but the sum of payments is zero, it will be included with `total_monthly_payments` as 0. However, if a calendar month has absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` table, it will not appear in the result, as the query is driven by existing data. The MoM calculation will be based on the sequence of months that *do* have payment data.

    mom_change=total_monthly_payments - PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()))
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `payment_info`: This intermediate step selects records from `PaymentsReceived` that have a `payment_date`. It then extracts `pay_year` and `pay_month` from `payment_date`. The original `payment_amount` is implicitly available for aggregation in subsequent steps.
2.  `monthly_aggregated_payments`:
    *   This step takes `payment_info` and partitions it by `pay_year` and `pay_month` using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(pay_year, pay_month))`.
    *   Within each group (each unique year/month combination), it calculates:
        *   `year_val`: The year of the group.
        *   `month_val`: The month of the group.
        *   `total_monthly_payments`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values from the original `PaymentsReceived` collection that fall into this year/month group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())` then sorts these monthly aggregates chronologically.
3.  `result`:
    *   This final step takes the chronologically sorted `monthly_aggregated_payments`.
    *   It calculates `mom_change` by subtracting the `total_monthly_payments` of the previous month from the current month's `total_monthly_payments`.
    *   The `PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()))` function looks up the `total_monthly_payments` from the immediately preceding record in the sequence ordered by `year_val` and `month_val`.
    *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV` will return `None`, resulting in `mom_change` being `None`, which is appropriate as there's no prior month for comparison.

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those individuals who have at least one record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. This ensures that we only consider salespersons who have actually made sales, which is necessary for a meaningful ASP calculation and to prevent division by zero.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered salesperson:
    *   `temp_sp_first_name=first_name` and `temp_sp_last_name=last_name`: The salesperson's first and last names are stored in temporary variables to be used later.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: The Average Selling Price (ASP) is calculated. `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` computes the total sales amount for the salesperson, and `COUNT(sales_made)` computes the total number of sales they made. The division gives the ASP.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This takes the collection of salespersons with their calculated ASPs and selects the top 3 records where `calculated_asp` is highest. `.DESC()` ensures descending order.
4.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step formats the output for the top 3 salespersons:
    *   `first_name=temp_sp_first_name`: Assigns the stored first name to the output field `first_name`.
    *   `last_name=temp_sp_last_name`: Assigns the stored last name to the output field `last_name`.
    *   `ASP=calculated_asp`: Assigns the calculated ASP to the output field `ASP`.

The variable `result` will hold the first names, last names, and ASPs of the top 3 salespersons.",40.408236265182495,"# Filter salespersons who have made at least one sale and calculate their ASP

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**:
    *   We start with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records) == 1` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection for each car is empty (i.e., the car has no associated sales records). It returns `True` (or `1`) if there are no sales records.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`**:
    *   After filtering, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the desired fields for the output.
    *   `car_id=_id` selects the `_id` field from the `Cars` collection and renames it to `car_id`.

1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have at least one record in their `car_purchases` sub-collection. The `HAS()` function is used for this, checking if the count of `car_purchases` is 1 or more (which `HAS()` does by default if `==1`).
3.  From the filtered customers, select their `_id` (which represents the customer ID) and rename it to `customer_id` for clarity. The `CALCULATE` operation will inherently produce distinct customer IDs because it operates on each unique customer record that meets the filter criteria.

This PyDough code snippet performs the following actions:

-   `.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`: Filters the customers. The `HAS(car_purchases) == 1` condition checks if a customer has one or more entries in their `car_purchases` list (i.e., they have made at least one purchase).
-   `.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`: For each customer who meets the criteria, this selects their `_id` field and renames it to `customer_id`.

1. Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2. For each salesperson, check their `sales_made`.
3. For each sale, check its `payment` records.
4. Filter these payments to find any where `payment_method` is ""cash"".
5. If such a payment exists for any sale made by a salesperson, that salesperson's ID should be included in the result.
6. The final list of salesperson IDs must be distinct.

We can achieve this by filtering the `Salespersons` collection. A salesperson is included if they have at least one sale (`sales_made`) which, in turn, has at least one payment (`payment`) where the `payment_method` is ""cash"". Using `HAS` allows us to check for the existence of such related records.
The `CALCULATE` function is then used to select the `_id` of the filtered salespersons. Since we are selecting `_id` from the (filtered) `Salespersons` collection, which inherently contains unique salespersons, the resulting list of IDs will be distinct.

```python
result = Salespersons.WHERE(
    HAS(sales_made.WHERE(HAS(payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)) == 1
).CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Salespersons` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause. Only salespersons who satisfy the specified condition will be included.

2.  **`HAS(sales_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the main condition for filtering salespersons. It checks if a salesperson has at least one sale (`sales_made`) that meets the inner condition.
    *   **`sales_made.WHERE(HAS(payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`**: This part filters the sales associated with a salesperson. It keeps only those sales for which the inner `HAS` condition is true.
        *   **`HAS(payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1`**: For each sale, this checks if there is at least one associated payment (`payment`) where the `payment_method` is equal to `""cash""`.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id)`**: After filtering, this function is applied to the remaining salespersons. It selects the `_id` field of each salesperson and renames it to `salesperson_id`.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate two key metrics:

This is achieved by accessing their `sales_made` sub-collection, filtering these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days (determined using `DATEDIFF` with `DATETIME('now')`), and then applying the `COUNT` aggregation.
    *   `revenue_last_30_days_calc`: The total revenue generated from these recent sales. This uses a similar filter on `sales_made` for the date range, followed by `SUM` on the `sale_price` of those sales.
3.  Filter these calculated metrics to include only salespersons who had at least one sale (`num_sales_last_30_days_calc > 0`). This ensures that we are ranking active salespersons and that revenue calculations are based on actual sales.
4.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 5 salespersons. The ranking is based on `num_sales_last_30_days_calc` in descending order.
5.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to format the output, selecting the salesperson's `first_name` and `last_name`, and renaming the calculated metrics to `total_sales_count` and `total_revenue_amount`. `DEFAULT_TO` is used for `total_revenue_amount` to ensure it defaults to 0.0 if the sum resulted in a null (though the prior filter makes this less likely for selected top salespersons).

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we create new fields:
    *   `customer_state_val`: Stores the state of the customer who made the sale (accessed via `customer.state`).
    *   `sale_price_val`: Stores the `sale_price` of the sale.
    *   `customer_id_val`: Stores the ID of the customer (`customer._id`), which will be used to count unique customers.

2.  `state_performance = sales_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then take the `sales_details` collection and partition it by `customer_state_val`. This groups all sales by the state of the customer.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each state group created by the partition:
        *   `state_name=customer_state_val`: We output the state's name.
        *   `state_total_revenue=SUM(sales_details.sale_price_val)`: We calculate the total revenue for the current state by summing the `sale_price_val` from all sales records (`sales_details`) belonging to this state group.
        *   `state_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(sales_details.customer_id_val)`: We count the number of unique customers in the current state by finding the number of distinct `customer_id_val` values from the sales records (`sales_details`) in this state group.

3.  `top_5_states_by_revenue = state_performance.TOP_K(5, by=state_total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, we take the `state_performance` collection (which contains state-level revenue and customer counts) and select the top 5 records, ordered by `state_total_revenue` in descending order.

1.  Access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  Group these payments by the `payment_method`.
3.  For each payment method, calculate:
    *   The total number of payments (i.e., count of transactions for that method).
    *   The sum of `payment_amount` for all payments made with that method.
4.  Order these payment methods by their total payment amount in descending order.
5.  Select the top 3 methods.
6.  Display the payment method, the total number of payments, and the total amount received for these top 3 methods.

We will use the `PARTITION` function to group by `payment_method`, then `CALCULATE` to compute the aggregates (count of payments and sum of payment amounts), and finally `TOP_K` to select the top 3 based on the total amount.

```python
top_payment_methods_by_amount = PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(
    name=""method_groups"", by=(payment_method)

    payment_method=payment_method,
    total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived),
    total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)
).TOP_K(3, by=total_amount.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""method_groups"", by=(payment_method))`:
    *   We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `PARTITION` is used to group the records.
    *   `name=""method_groups""` assigns a name to these partitioned groups (though not directly used in this specific `CALCULATE` that follows immediately).
    *   `by=(payment_method)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values of the `payment_method` field.

2.  `.CALCULATE(payment_method=payment_method, total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived), total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount))`:
    *   This `CALCULATE` operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` (which is the key of the current partition group).
    *   `total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Calculates the total number of payments for the current payment method group by counting the records in `PaymentsReceived` that fall into this group.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments within the current payment method group.

3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the result from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of payment methods with their aggregated counts and sums).
    *   `TOP_K(3, ...)` selects the top 3 records.
    *   `by=total_amount.DESC()` specifies that the sorting should be based on the `total_amount` field in descending order, so we get the methods with the highest total amounts.

1.  For each sale, identify the make and model of the car sold. The `Sales` collection has a reference to `car`, and the `Cars` collection (via `Sales.car`) contains `make` and `model` attributes.
2.  Group all sales by the unique combinations of car make and model. This can be achieved using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each make-model group, calculate the total revenue (sum of `sale_price` for all sales in that group) and the total number of sales (count of sales in that group).
4.  Rank these make-model groups by their total revenue in descending order and select the top 5.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_make_model = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the associated car ( `Sales.car.make` and `Sales.car.model`) and store them as `temp_car_make` and `temp_car_model`.
2.  `grouped_sales_by_model = sales_with_make_model.PARTITION(...)`: The sales data (now including `temp_car_make` and `temp_car_model`) is partitioned (grouped) by these two fields. This creates groups of sales, where each group corresponds to a unique car make and model.
3.  `model_revenue_and_sales = grouped_sales_by_model.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `make`: The car make (from the partition key `temp_car_make`).
    *   `model`: The car model (from the partition key `temp_car_model`).
    *   `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific make-model group. `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` refers to the `sale_price` attribute of the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition.
    *   `total_sales`: The total count of sales within that specific make-model group, using `COUNT(Sales)`.
4.  `top_5_models_by_revenue = model_revenue_and_sales.TOP_K(...)`: From the collection of make-model groups with their calculated revenues and sales counts, we select the top 5 based on `total_revenue` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HASNOT(termination_date) == 0)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those records where `termination_date` is present (i.e., not null or missing). This ensures we are only considering salespersons who have been terminated.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates new fields for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `full_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates a full name by concatenating `first_name` and `last_name` with a space.
    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the salesperson's phone number.
    *   `employment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between `hire_date` and `termination_date` in days, representing the total duration of employment.
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`: From the salespersons with calculated durations, this selects the top 1 record, ordered by `employment_duration_days` in ascending order. This effectively finds the salesperson with the shortest employment period.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two key date values at the highest `Dealership` level.
    *   `prev_iso_week_start_dt_val`: Calculates the start date of the previous ISO week (Monday at 00:00:00) by taking the start of the current week and subtracting 7 days.
    *   `prev_iso_week_next_monday_dt_val`: Calculates the start date of the current ISO week (Monday at 00:00:00). This will serve as the exclusive upper boundary for our date filter, ensuring we capture the entirety of the previous Sunday.

2.  `payments_in_prev_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause selects payments where `payment_date` is greater than or equal to `prev_iso_week_start_dt_val` AND less than `prev_iso_week_next_monday_dt_val`. This correctly captures all payments made during the seven full days of the previous ISO week.

3.  `payments_info_for_partition = payments_in_prev_week.CALCULATE(...)`: We prepare the filtered data for partitioning.
    *   `p_day_calc=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: For each payment, this extracts the calendar date part by truncating any time component, ensuring that all payments on the same day are grouped together, regardless of the time they occurred.
    *   `p_method_calc=payment_method`: This simply carries over the `payment_method` for grouping.

4.  `daily_payments_by_method = payments_info_for_partition.PARTITION(...)`: We partition (group) the data.
    *   `name=""daily_method_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition.
    *   `by=(p_day_calc, p_method_calc)`: Groups the records first by the calculated payment day (`p_day_calc`) and then by the payment method (`p_method_calc`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After partitioning, we calculate the required aggregate.
        *   `payment_day_out=p_day_calc` and `payment_method_out=p_method_calc`: These bring the partition keys into the result.
        *   `total_daily_amount_out=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: For each group (i.e., for each unique day and payment method combination in the previous week), this sums up the `payment_amount` of all `PaymentsReceived` records belonging to that group.

5.  `result = daily_payments_by_method.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` step is used to rename the fields to the desired output names (`payment_day`, `payment_method`, `total_daily_amount`).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(payment_day_out.ASC(), payment_method_out.ASC())`: The results are ordered chronologically by payment day, and then alphabetically by payment method within each day, for easier readability.",62.696239948272705,"# Step 1: Define the date boundaries for the previous ISO week at the Dealership graph level.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.

    *   The state of the customer (`customer_state_val`).
    *   A string representing the first date of the quarter in which the sale occurred (`quarter_repr_str`). This will be ""2023-01-01"" for Q1, ""2023-04-01"" for Q2, and so on.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `customer_state_val` and `quarter_repr_str`.
4.  For each group (each state-quarter combination), calculate the sum of `sale_price`. This sum will be the `total_quarterly_sales`.
5.  The final result will display the customer's state, the string representation of the quarter's first date, and the total sales for that state and quarter.

    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then processes each of these filtered sales:
        *   `customer_state_val = customer.state`: Extracts the state of the customer associated with the sale.
        *   `quarter_repr_str = IFF(...)`: Determines the quarter of the `sale_date`.
            *   `MONTH(sale_date)` gets the month number (1-12).
            *   The nested `IFF` statements assign a string representing the first day of that quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01"" for months 1-3, ""2023-04-01"" for months 4-6, etc.).

2.  `result = sales_for_partitioning.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation for each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
3.  `avg_ddd_val=AVG(...)`: This calculates the average DDD for the current drug. The `AVG` function will operate on a list of DDD values derived from the drug's treatments.
4.  `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments associated with the current drug.
5.  `.WHERE(HASNOT(end_dt) == 0)`: Filters these treatments to include only those that have a non-null `end_dt` (end date). `HASNOT(end_dt)==0` means `end_dt` is present.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these filtered treatments, a new set of fields is calculated:
    *   `treatment_duration=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: Calculates the duration of the treatment in full days.
    *   `ddd=IFF(treatment_duration > 0, tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration, None)`: Calculates the Defined Daily Dose (DDD). If `treatment_duration` is positive, DDD is `tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration`. Otherwise (if duration is zero or negative), `ddd` is set to `None`. This prevents division by zero and handles cases where DDD is not meaningfully calculable.
7.  `.ddd`: After the inner `CALCULATE`, this projects the `ddd` field. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these non-null `ddd` values for all valid treatments of the current drug.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data**: We select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this three-month window. For each of these treatments, we:
    *   Create a string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") for grouping.
    *   Extract the `patient_id`.
    *   Determine if the treatment involved a biologic drug by checking if `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`.
3.  **Group by Month**: The prepared treatment data is then partitioned by the year-month string. This allows us to perform aggregations for each month separately.
4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month's group:
    *   We count the number of unique `patient_id`s to get the total distinct patients who had any treatment.
    *   We count the number of unique `patient_id`s for treatments that were flagged as biologic to get the distinct patients who received biologic drugs.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Calculate Distinct Drug Counts per Doctor**:
    First, we need to iterate through each doctor and count the number of unique drugs they have prescribed. We can access this through `Doctors.prescribed_treatments` (which are `Treatments`), then `Treatments.drug` (which is a `Drug`), and finally `Drug.drug_id`. We'll use `NDISTINCT` on `prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id`. We'll also select `doc_id` and `speciality` at this stage.

2.  **Partition Doctors by Specialty**:
    To rank doctors *within* their specialty, we first need to group them by specialty. We can use the `PARTITION` function for this, partitioning the results from step 1 by the doctor's specialty.

3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**:
    Once partitioned, we can access the doctors within each specialty group. For these doctors, we will calculate their rank using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking will be based on the `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` (in descending order, so more drugs = rank 1) and will be performed `per` the specialty partition group created in step 2. We'll assume ties are allowed (e.g., if two doctors prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they get the same rank).

4.  **Select Final Output Fields**:
    Finally, we select the required fields: `doc_id`, `specialty`, the calculated `number_of_distinct_drugs_prescribed`, and the calculated rank `SDRSDR`.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed for each doctor,
# along with their ID and specialty.
doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(
    doc_id = doc_id,
    # Store the original speciality field for partitioning and later use.

    num_distinct_drugs_prescribed_calc = NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)

doctors_partitioned_by_specialty = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(
    name=""specialty_partition"", # This name is used by RANKING's 'per' argument.
    by=(original_speciality)
)

# Step 3: Access the doctors within each specialty partition and calculate their rank.

    # Rank doctors within their specialty ('per=""specialty_partition""').
    # Higher number of distinct drugs gets a better rank (e.g., rank 1).
    # allow_ties=True means doctors with the same count get the same rank.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   It calculates three fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `original_speciality`: The doctor's specialty, stored with an intermediate name to be used for partitioning and in the final output.
        *   `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed_calc`: The count of unique drugs prescribed by the doctor. This is achieved by looking at `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments by the doctor), then for each treatment its linked `drug`, and then the `drug_id` of that drug. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `drug_id`s.

2.  `doctors_partitioned_by_specialty = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection and partitions it.
    *   `name=""specialty_partition""`: Assigns a name to these partition groups, which is crucial for the `RANKING` function's `per` clause.
    *   `by=(original_speciality)`: Specifies that doctors should be grouped based on their `original_speciality`.

3.  `result = doctors_partitioned_by_specialty.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line processes the doctors within each `specialty_partition`. The `.Doctors` part accesses the individual doctor records (which were originally from `doctors_with_drug_counts`) within each specialty group.
    *   It calculates the final set of fields for output:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `specialty`: The doctor's specialty (taken from `original_speciality`).
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs_prescribed`: The count of distinct drugs prescribed (taken from `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed_calc`).
        *   `SDRSDR`: The doctor's rank. This is calculated using `RANKING()`:
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs_prescribed_calc.DESC()`: Ranks based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (so more drugs lead to a lower, i.e., better, rank number like 1, 2, etc.).
            *   `per=""specialty_partition""`: Ensures the ranking is done independently within each specialty group defined by the partition.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors in the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.",78.07665038108826,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed for each doctor,

The aggregation is based on the `start_dt` of treatments, truncated to the month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatments**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to derive two helper fields:
        *   `treatment_start_month_calc`: The `start_dt` of each treatment truncated to the beginning of its month. This is used for date range filtering.
        *   `treatment_month_year_calc`: A string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") of the `start_dt`. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `WHERE` filters these treatments to include only those whose `treatment_start_month_calc` falls within the last 12 full months, excluding the current month.
        *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-12 months')` defines the beginning of the 12-month period (e.g., if today is 2023-10-15, this would be 2022-10-01).
        *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` defines the end of the period (exclusive, e.g., 2023-10-01). So, data up to 2023-09-30 would be included.

2.  **Group by Month and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered treatments are then `PARTITION`ed by `treatment_month_year_calc`, creating groups for each month.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `month_year`: The year-month string.
        *   `PMPD`: Per Month Patient Diagnoses, calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received at least one treatment (and thus a diagnosis) in that month.
        *   `PMTC`: Per Month Treatment Count, calculated as `COUNT(Treatments)`. This counts the total number of treatments administered in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(month_year.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically by month.

```python

1.  Start from the `Drugs` collection and filter for the drug with `drug_name == 'Drugalin'`.
2.  Access the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for this drug, which gives all treatments where 'Drugalin' was used.
3.  For each of these treatments, access the `patient` associated with it. This will result in a collection of patients who received 'Drugalin'.
4.  From this collection of patients, access their `weight_kg`.
5.  Finally, calculate the average of these `weight_kg` values using the `AVG` function.
6.  The result will be a single value representing the average weight, calculated at the `DermTreatment` graph level.

A new patient is defined as a patient starting their first treatment. The NPI is the increase in the number of new patients compared to the previous year.

The process involves these steps:
1.  For each patient who has received at least one treatment, determine the year of their very first treatment. This is done by finding the minimum `start_dt` among all their `treatments_received` and extracting the year.
2.  Group these patients by the year of their first treatment and count the number of unique new patients for each year.
3.  Order these yearly counts chronologically.
4.  Calculate the NPI for each year by subtracting the previous year's count of new patients from the current year's count. The `PREV` window function is used for this, and it will correctly result in a `None` or null NPI for the earliest year in the dataset as there's no preceding year to compare against.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`:
    *   `Patients.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`: Filters for patients who have at least one treatment record.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year_of_first_treatment = YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))`: For each of these patients, it calculates `year_of_first_treatment`. This is derived by finding the minimum `start_dt` (earliest date) from all their `treatments_received` and then extracting the `YEAR` from that date. This effectively gives the year when each patient had their first treatment.

2.  `yearly_new_patients_counts`:
    *   `patient_first_treatment_info.PARTITION(name=""year_groups"", by=(year_of_first_treatment))`: Groups the records from `patient_first_treatment_info` based on the `year_of_first_treatment`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year_val = year_of_first_treatment, num_new_patients_current_year = COUNT(Patients))`: For each group (i.e., for each year), it outputs the `year_val` (the year itself) and `num_new_patients_current_year`, which is the count of unique patients whose first treatment occurred in that year. `COUNT(Patients)` here counts the distinct patients within each partition.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(year_val.ASC())`: Sorts the results by year in ascending order, which is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly in the next step.

3.  `result`:

1.  **Filter Outcomes**: We first identify the `Outcomes` records that are relevant for this calculation. According to the definition, we should only include those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null.
2.  **Calculate Average PASI Scores**: From these filtered outcomes, we calculate the overall average `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score`. These averages are calculated globally across all relevant treatments.
3.  **Apply the D7D100PIR Formula**: We then use the provided formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100`.
4.  **Handle Division by Zero**: If the average PASI score on day 7 is zero, the division would be undefined. We use the `IFF` function to handle this case, returning `None`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))`: This line filters the `Outcomes` collection to create a new temporary collection `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`. This collection includes only those outcome records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` have non-null values. This adheres to the condition that only patients (represented by outcome records) with scores for both timepoints are included.

2.  `overall_averages = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculation is performed at the `DermTreatment` graph level, meaning it computes global aggregates.
    *   `avg_d7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.
    *   `avg_d100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.

3.  `result = overall_averages.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the D7D100PIR.
    *   `D7D100PIR = IFF(...)`: The `IFF` function is used to handle the division in the formula.
        *   `avg_d7_pasi != 0`: This is the condition. If the average PASI score on day 7 is not zero, the calculation proceeds.
        *   `(avg_d100_pasi - avg_d7_pasi) / avg_d7_pasi * 100.0`: This is the D7D100PIR formula. Multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and floating-point arithmetic is used.
        *   `None`: If `avg_d7_pasi` is zero (meaning the condition is false), `None` is returned to represent an undefined result due to division by zero.

3.  To do this, for each drug, we iterate through its `treatments_used_in`.
4.  For each treatment, we determine its start year and start month.
5.  Then, for each treatment, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` (of the adverse event) has the same year and month as the treatment's start date. This gives a count of matched adverse events per treatment.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over each drug in the `Drugs` collection and prepare to calculate new fields.
    *   `drug_id_val=drug_id`: Selects the `drug_id`.
    *   `drug_name_val=drug_name`: Selects the `drug_name`.
    *   `num_matched_adverse_events=SUM(...)`: This calculates the total number of adverse events for the current drug that meet the specified date criteria. The `SUM` aggregates counts from individual treatments associated with the drug.

2.  `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`: For each drug, this part processes its associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`).
    *   `treat_start_year=YEAR(start_dt)`: Extracts the year from the treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   `treat_start_month=MONTH(start_dt)`: Extracts the month from the treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   `count_events_for_this_treatment=COUNT(...)`: For the current treatment, this counts the number of its adverse events that satisfy the date condition.

3.  `adverse_events.WHERE(...)`: This filters the adverse events for a specific treatment.
    *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == treat_start_year) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == treat_start_month)`: This condition ensures that the adverse event's `reported_dt` is in the same calendar year and month as the treatment's `start_dt`.

4.  `.count_events_for_this_treatment`: After the inner `CALCULATE` processes each treatment and computes `count_events_for_this_treatment`, this expression accesses that computed count. The `SUM` function then aggregates these counts from all treatments linked to the current drug.

3.  From the filtered list of doctors, we need to get their unique `loc_state` values. The `PARTITION` function is suitable for this, grouping the doctors by `loc_state`.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select the `loc_state` from each partition, which will give us the distinct states.

2.  `.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state)`:
    *   This takes the filtered collection of doctors (those who prescribed biologic drugs).
    *   It partitions these doctors based on their `loc_state`. Each partition will correspond to a unique state.
    *   `name=""state_group""` assigns a temporary name to these partitions.

3.  `.CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)`:
    *   This operates on the result of the `PARTITION`.
    *   For each partition (each unique state), it creates a record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Relevant Treatments**: The code starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection. It selects treatments that ended in the year 2022 (`YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`). It also ensures that these treatments have linked `outcome_records` (necessary for PASI scores) and a linked `patient` (necessary for insurance type) using the `HAS()` function.

2.  **Prepare for Partitioning**: An intermediate step calculates `derived_ins_type` from `patient.ins_type` for each filtered treatment. This is done because the `PARTITION` function's `by` clause requires direct attributes of the collection being partitioned.

3.  **Partition and Aggregate**: The `treatments_for_grouping` collection is then partitioned by `derived_ins_type`. For each resulting group (i.e., for each insurance type):
    *   The `insurance_type` is selected for output.
    *   `average_pasi_score_day100` is calculated by averaging all `day100_pasi_score` values from the `outcome_records` associated with treatments in that specific insurance type group.
    *   `number_of_distinct_patients` is calculated by counting the unique `patient_id`s for patients who received treatments within that insurance type group.

4.  **Select Top 5**: Finally, the `TOP_K` function is used to select the top 5 insurance types. The sorting is done by `average_pasi_score_day100` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so types with the lowest average PASI scores appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Diagnoses.WHERE(HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Diagnoses` collection and filters it to include only those diagnoses that have at least one associated outcome record through their treatments. This is important to ensure that `MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)` has data to operate on.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each diagnosis passing the filter, this step calculates three values:
    *   `diag_name_val=diag_name`: Stores the diagnosis name.
    *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records linked to the treatments for the current diagnosis.
    *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score_val.DESC())`: This takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 3 diagnoses. The sorting is done based on `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first).

3.  For each remaining drug, calculate:

    *   The treatment has ended (i.e., `end_dt` is not null) and the `end_dt` falls within the last 6 months from the current date. This is checked using `(HAS(Treatments.end_dt) == 1) & (Treatments.end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (Treatments.end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`.

Explanation:
*   We start with `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to compute a single aggregated value: the total count of qualifying treatments.
*   `COUNT(Treatments.WHERE(...))` counts the records from the `Treatments` collection that satisfy the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause.
*   Inside the `WHERE` clause:
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This filters for treatments where the `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` contains ""psoriasis"". `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the `drug` associated with the treatment has an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), meaning the field is not null.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the treatment has actually ended by checking if the `end_dt` field is not null.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This filters for treatments whose `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current date. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This ensures the `end_dt` is not in the future, effectively meaning it ended on or before the current date.
*   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so a treatment must satisfy all of them to be included in the count.

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To calculate the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we need to perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`), specifying ""years"" as the unit.
4.  Finally, calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.

The result will be a single value representing the average age.

```python
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    avg_patient_age = AVG(

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the average age).
2.  `avg_patient_age = AVG(...)`: We define a new field `avg_patient_age` that will hold the result of the `AVG` (average) aggregation.
3.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Male"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`: This part accesses the `Patients` collection and filters it.
    *   `gender == ""Male""`: Selects only male patients.
    *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Selects only patients with private insurance.
    *   `&`: The logical AND operator combines these two conditions.
4.  `.CALCULATE(age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each patient that passes the `WHERE` filter, this calculates a new temporary field `age_in_years`.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`: This function calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`), effectively giving their current age in integer years.

1.  Iterate through each merchant.
2.  For each merchant, identify all transactions they received (`transactions_received`).
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those with a `status` of ""successful"".
4.  From these successful transactions, calculate:
    a.  The number of distinct coupons used: This involves looking at transactions that have an associated `coupon_id` (i.e., `coupon_id` is not `None`) and counting the number of unique `coupon_id` values.
    b.  The number of distinct successful transactions: This is the count of all transactions filtered in step 3.
5.  Calculate CPUR using the formula: `CPUR = number of distinct coupons used / number of distinct successful transactions`.
6.  Handle cases where there are no successful transactions to avoid division by zero (CPUR will be `0.0` in such cases).
7.  Return the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` operation is performed for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`:  The merchant's `name` is selected and aliased to `merchant_name_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons_val=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of distinct coupons used.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (coupon_id != None))`: It first filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"" and have an associated `coupon_id` (meaning a coupon was actually applied).
        *   `.coupon_id`: From these filtered transactions, it considers the `coupon_id`.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id` values.
    *   `num_distinct_successful_transactions_val=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the total number of distinct successful transactions.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: It filters the merchant's received transactions for those with `status == ""successful""`.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts these successful transactions.

2.  `merchant_stats.CALCULATE(...)`: The result of the first `CALCULATE` (now `merchant_stats`) is then processed by a second `CALCULATE`.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: The merchant's name is passed through to the final result.
    *   `cpur=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_transactions_val > 0, ...)`: This is a conditional function. It checks if the number of distinct successful transactions is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons_val / num_distinct_successful_transactions_val`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to distinct successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions (`num_distinct_successful_transactions_val` is 0), CPUR is set to `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining three reference dates at the highest level (`Ewallet`): `ref_last_week_start`, `ref_two_weeks_ago_start`, and `ref_three_weeks_ago_start`. These represent the start of the last full week, the week before that, and the week before that one, respectively, effectively excluding the current week.
2.  `Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, (""US"", ""Canada"")))`: We filter the `Users` collection to include only users from the 'US' or 'Canada'.
3.  `.notifications`: We access the `notifications` associated with these filtered users.
4.  `.CALCULATE(notification_actual_week_start = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week'), notification_day_name = DAYNAME(created_at))`: For each notification, we calculate `notification_actual_week_start` by truncating its `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week. We also extract the `notification_day_name` (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"").
5.  `.WHERE(ISIN(notification_actual_week_start, (ref_last_week_start, ref_two_weeks_ago_start, ref_three_weeks_ago_start)))`: We filter these notifications, keeping only those whose `notification_actual_week_start` matches one of our three pre-defined reference weeks.
6.  `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_notifications_group"", by=(notification_actual_week_start))`: The filtered notifications are then partitioned into groups based on their `notification_actual_week_start`. Each group will represent one of the three target weeks.
7.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each partition (i.e., for each week):
    *   `week_start_display = notification_actual_week_start`: We select the week's start date for display.
    *   `total_notifications_in_week = COUNT(Notifications)`: We count all notifications within this weekly group.
    *   `weekend_notifications_in_week = COUNT(Notifications.WHERE(ISIN(notification_day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: We count notifications within this weekly group where the `notification_day_name` is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
8.  `.ORDER_BY(week_start_display.DESC())`: Finally, the results are ordered by the week start date in descending order, showing the most recent of the three weeks first.",40.383323669433594,"result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.

3.  Further filter to ensure these merchants have issued at least one coupon using `HAS(coupons)`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants`: We start by selecting the `Merchants` collection.
2.  `.WHERE((status == ""active"") & (LOWER(category) == ""retail"") & (HAS(coupons) == 1))`: This filters the merchants based on three conditions:
    *   `status == ""active""`: Ensures the merchant is currently active.
    *   `LOWER(category) == ""retail""`: Checks if the merchant's category is ""retail"", ignoring case by converting the category to lowercase.
    *   `HAS(coupons) == 1`: Ensures that the merchant has at least one coupon associated with them.
3.  `.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons))`: For each merchant that passes the filter, this step calculates:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the merchant and renames it to `merchant_name`.
    *   `total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`: Counts the number of coupons associated with that merchant from their `coupons` sub-collection and names this count `total_coupons_issued`.

1.  Access the `Transactions` collection.
2.  Filter these transactions based on the following criteria:
    *   The transaction must have been made by a sending user (`sending_user`).
    *   The `country` of the `sending_user` must be 'US'.
    *   The transaction's `created_at` date must be within the last 7 days, inclusive of the current day. This means the difference in days between `created_at` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) should be between 0 and 6, inclusive. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) >= 0` to ensure the transaction is not in the future, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` to ensure it's within the 7-day window.
3.  Calculate two aggregate values from the filtered transactions at the `Ewallet` graph level:
    *   The total count of these transactions.
    *   The sum of the `amount` for these transactions.

```python

result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions),
    total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions.amount)

```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first defines `filtered_transactions` by starting with the `Transactions` collection and applying filters:
1.  `sending_user.country == 'US'`: This ensures that only transactions sent by users located in the 'US' are considered. It accesses the `country` attribute of the `sending_user` associated with each transaction.
2.  `(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This compound condition filters transactions based on their `created_at` timestamp.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's creation date and the current date/time.
    *   `>= 0` ensures the transaction date is not in the future.
    *   `<= 6` ensures the transaction occurred at most 6 days ago (covering a 7-day period inclusive of today, e.g., today, yesterday, ..., 6 days ago).

Finally, `Ewallet.CALCULATE` is used to compute the aggregate results from the `filtered_transactions`:
-   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions that met the criteria.
-   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions.amount)`: Sums the `amount` of these transactions.

"What is the average AMB for user wallets updated in the past week, inclusive of 7 days ago? Return the average balance.AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)","SELECT AVG(balance) AS AMB FROM wallet_user_balance_daily WHERE updated_at >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Ewallet,"The query aims to calculate the average AMB (Average Balance per User) for user wallets updated in the ""past week, inclusive of 7 days ago"".

Here's how we interpret the request and construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Date Range Interpretation**:
    *   ""Past week, inclusive of 7 days ago"" is interpreted as a rolling window of 8 days, starting from 7 days prior to the current date, up to and including the current date. For example, if today is October 27th, ""7 days ago"" is October 20th. The window includes all updates from October 20th, 00:00:00 through October 27th, current time.
    *   This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7`. This condition selects `UserBalances` where `updated_at` falls within this 8-day period.

2.  **AMB Definition**:
    *   The problem defines ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"".
    *   This means for each user, we first calculate their average balance using all their balance entries that fall within the 8-day window.

3.  **Calculation Steps**:
    *   **Step 1: Filter relevant `UserBalances`**: Select all `UserBalances` records where `updated_at` is within the interpreted 8-day period.
    *   **Step 2: Calculate AMB per user**: Group these filtered balances by `user_id`. For each user, calculate the average of their `balance` amounts during this period. This gives the AMB for each user.
    *   **Step 3: Calculate the final average AMB**: Take all the individual user AMBs calculated in Step 2 and compute their average. This results in a single value representing the average AMB across all active users in the specified period.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for entries updated from 7 days ago until now (inclusive).
# This forms an 8-day window: [today-7 days, today].
# DATEDIFF(""days"", date1, date2) <= 7 means date1 occurred at most 7 full days before date2,
# effectively covering an 8-day span when considering date parts (e.g., 20th to 27th inclusive).
user_balances_in_period = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)

# Step 2: For each user, calculate their average balance over this period.
# This is the AMB for each user for the specified duration.
# We partition the filtered balances by user_id.
user_amb_values = user_balances_in_period.PARTITION(name=""user_group"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(
    # The field user_id from the partition key is implicitly available.
    # AVG(UserBalances.balance) calculates the average balance for the current user's
    # balances within the 'user_balances_in_period' context.

# This gives the final requested ""average AMB"".

**Explanation of the code:**

1.  `user_balances_in_period = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7)`:
    *   This line filters the `UserBalances` collection.
    *   It selects records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 8 days (from 7 days ago up to the current moment, inclusive). `DATEDIFF(""days"", t1, t2)` calculates the number of full day transitions between `t1` and `t2`. `DATETIME('now')` provides the current timestamp.

2.  `user_amb_values = user_balances_in_period.PARTITION(name=""user_group"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the filtered `user_balances_in_period`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""user_group"", by=(user_id))` groups these balances by `user_id`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(amb_for_this_user = AVG(UserBalances.balance))` then computes a new field `amb_for_this_user` for each group (i.e., for each user).

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to create a new set of fields for each user.

3.  **`latest_balance = ...`**: This part calculates the LUB.

    *   **`RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we rank the balance records.
        *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks the balances by the `updated_at` field in descending order, so the most recent balance gets rank 1.
        *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures that the ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
        *   `== 1`: Filters to keep only the balance record(s) with rank 1 (the latest).
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: After filtering, we expect only one latest balance record per user. `.SINGULAR()` is used to assert this and allow direct field access. If a user had multiple balance entries with the exact same latest `updated_at` timestamp, `RANKING` (by default `allow_ties=False`) would pick one.
    *   **`.balance`**: From the singular, latest balance record, we extract the actual `balance` amount.
    *   If a user has no balance records, this expression will likely result in a null value for `latest_balance`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start by iterating over the `Users` collection. The `CALCULATE` function allows us to define new fields for each user.

2.  **`user_id = uid`**: For each user, we select their `uid` and name it `user_id` in the output.

3.  **`opt_in_value = ...`**: This part calculates the marketing opt-in preference.
    *   **`setting_snapshots`**: Within the context of each user in `CALCULATE`, `setting_snapshots` refers to the collection of setting snapshots specifically for that user.
    *   **`.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1)`**:
        *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC())`: This function ranks the `setting_snapshots` for the current user. The ranking is done based on `snapshot_date` in descending order, so the most recent snapshot gets rank 1. Since `setting_snapshots` here are already scoped to the current user, `per` argument is not needed for `RANKING`.
        *   The `WHERE` clause then filters these snapshots to keep only the one(s) with rank 1 (i.e., the latest snapshot). By default, `RANKING` does not allow ties for rank 1, so it will pick one if multiple snapshots share the exact latest timestamp.
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: This function is used to convert the result of the `WHERE` clause (which should be a single, latest snapshot record) into a singular record context. This allows us to access its fields directly.
    *   **`.marketing_opt_in`**: Finally, we access the `marketing_opt_in` field from this singular latest snapshot. This field contains the boolean opt-in value.

4.  The result, `user_marketing_opt_in_details`, will be a collection where each record contains the `user_id` and their corresponding `opt_in_value` from their latest settings snapshot.

    *   These transactions must satisfy two conditions:
        *   `status == ""completed""`: To count only ""successfully received transactions"".
        *   `receiver_type == 1`: As specified by ""Filter receiver_type=1 ... for merchants"", ensuring the transaction correctly identifies the receiver as a merchant of the specified type.
    *   The sum of `amount` for these filtered transactions gives the `total_revenue` for the merchant.
    *   We select the merchant's `name` and `category` at this stage, aliasing them to avoid conflicts and for clarity (e.g., `mer_name`, `mer_category`).
3.  **Rank Merchants**:
    *   Using the calculated `total_revenue`, we rank the merchants.
    *   The `RANKING()` function is used with `by=total_revenue.DESC()` because rank 1 corresponds to the highest revenue.
    *   We set `allow_ties=True` to ensure that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank, which is standard ranking behavior.
4.  **Select Final Output Fields**:
    *   The final output includes `merchant_name`, `category`, `revenue_amount`, and the calculated `revenue_rank`.

```python
# Calculate initial revenue details for each merchant
merchant_revenue_details = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    mer_name=name,
    mer_category=category,
    # Sum the amount of transactions received by the merchant that are completed and have receiver_type = 1
    total_revenue=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)
)

# Calculate the rank and select the final fields
result = merchant_revenue_details.CALCULATE(
    merchant_name=mer_name,
    category=mer_category, # Output field name is 'category'
    revenue_amount=total_revenue,
    # Rank merchants by their total revenue in descending order, allowing ties
    revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC(), allow_ties=True)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` operation processes the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant:
    *   It retrieves their `name` (as `mer_name`) and `category` (as `mer_category`).
    *   It calculates `total_revenue` by summing the `amount` of transactions found in the merchant's `transactions_received` sub-collection. This sum only includes transactions that meet the criteria: `status` is ""completed"" AND `receiver_type` is 1.

2.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the output of the first step (`merchant_revenue_details`) and:
    *   Selects `mer_name` as `merchant_name` and `mer_category` as `category` for the final output.
    *   Includes the calculated `total_revenue` as `revenue_amount`.
    *   Computes `revenue_rank` using the `RANKING` function. The ranking is based on `total_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple merchants have the same revenue, they will share the same rank.",59.089656829833984,"# Calculate initial revenue details for each merchant

PMDAU is interpreted as the average number of daily active users within a given month. An active user for a day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from transactions where `sender_type` is 0.

The process involves these steps:
1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: Calculate the start and end timestamps for the period covering the last two full months. This means from the beginning of the month two months ago up to the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this date range and have `sender_type == 0`.
3.  **Extract Date Components**: For each relevant transaction, extract the year, month, and day from the `created_at` timestamp.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Group the filtered transactions by year, month, and day. For each day, count the number of distinct `sender_id` values. This gives the DAU for each day.
5.  **Calculate PMDAU**: Group the DAU figures by year and month. For each month, calculate the average of the DAU counts. This average is the PMDAU.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by year and month.

The query will be performed at the `Ewallet` (graph) level to produce a single aggregated result. We'll use chained `CALCULATE` operations to build the necessary values step by step.

wallet_transactions_str_previous_month = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    # Step 1: Define helper values for the previous month's year and month.

    # and '-1 months' subtracts one month to get to the beginning of the previous month.
    # YEAR() and MONTH() extract the respective parts.
    _helper_prev_month_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 months')),
    _helper_prev_month_month = MONTH(DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 months'))

    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts by calculating helper values `_helper_prev_month_year` and `_helper_prev_month_month`. These represent the year and month of the calendar month immediately preceding the current one. This is achieved using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 months')` to get the first moment of the previous month, and then extracting its year and month.
2.  In the second `CALCULATE` step:
    *   `_num_successful_transactions_prev_month`: Counts transactions from the `Transactions` collection where the `created_at` date falls within the `_helper_prev_month_year` and `_helper_prev_month_month`, AND the transaction `status` is ""completed"" (this is assumed to signify a successful transaction).
    *   `_num_total_transactions_prev_month`: Counts all transactions from the `Transactions` collection where the `created_at` date falls within the `_helper_prev_month_year` and `_helper_prev_month_month`, regardless of their status.
3.  The final `CALCULATE` step computes the `previous_month_str` (Success Transaction Rate):
    *   It uses an `IFF` function to check if `_num_total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than zero.
    *   If true, it calculates STR by dividing `_num_successful_transactions_prev_month` by `_num_total_transactions_prev_month`. Multiplying by `1.0` ensures the result is a float.
    *   If false (i.e., no transactions in the previous month), it returns `0.0` to prevent a division-by-zero error.

The variable `wallet_transactions_str_previous_month` will hold the result, which is a collection containing a single row and a single column named `previous_month_str`, representing the calculated STR.",64.57377171516418,"wallet_transactions_str_previous_month = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_creation_details = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step iterates through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
    *   It calculates `merchant_creation_year` (the year the merchant was created) and `merchant_creation_month` (the month the merchant was created) using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions on the merchant's `created_at` field.
    *   It also renames `mid` to `m_identifier` and `name` to `m_name_val` to carry these values forward.

2.  `merchant_coupon_counts = merchant_creation_details.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step takes the output from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_period`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for the current merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using `WHERE`. The condition checks if the coupon's `created_at` year and month match the `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` (which were calculated in the previous step for the parent merchant).
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are carried over as `temp_mid` and `temp_name`.

3.  `top_merchant_by_coupons = merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(...)`:
    *   This step takes the collection of merchants (each now having the count of relevant coupons).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_period.DESC())` selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_period`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

4.  `result = top_merchant_by_coupons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This final step takes the single merchant record returned by `TOP_K`.
    *   It selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `mid` (from `temp_mid`), `name` (from `temp_name`), and `num_coupons` (from `num_coupons_in_creation_period`).",60.884955167770386,"# Step 1: Calculate each merchant's creation year and month, and carry over their ID and name.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Users` collection.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters users whose `country` is 'US'. `LOWER(country)` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive as requested.
3.  **`& (HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1)`**: This is an additional filter condition combined with an AND (`&`).
    *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This part accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and filters them to include only those where `notification_type` is exactly 'promotional' AND `status` is exactly 'unread'.
    *   **`HAS(...) == 1`**: The `HAS` function checks if the filtered `notifications` sub-collection (i.e., unread promotional notifications) is not empty for the current user. We only keep users who have at least one such notification.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who meet the above criteria, we then calculate the desired output fields:

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only relevant transactions. These are transactions:

    *   Sent by a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
    *   That were successful (`status == ""successful""`).
    *   Where the sending user is currently active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` from the `created_at` field. These will be used for grouping.
3.  We then partition these transactions by `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
4.  For each month-year group, we:
    *   Create a formatted month string `month_identifier` (e.g., ""2023-01"").
    *   Calculate the number of distinct sending users (`count_distinct_users`) using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`. This counts the unique user IDs among the senders of the transactions within that specific month's group.
5.  The results are ordered by year and then by month to ensure they start from the earliest date.

**Explanation:**

Return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications.,SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM notifications WHERE type = 'transaction';,Ewallet,"To return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications, we can follow these steps:

1.  Start with the `Users` collection, as we are interested in user IDs.
2.  Filter these users to include only those who have at least one notification that is a ""transaction notification"".
    *   We can access a user's notifications via the `Users.notifications` sub-collection.
    *   To check for the existence of relevant notifications, we use the `HAS()` function.
    *   A notification is considered a ""transaction notification"" if its `notification_type` field contains the substring ""TRANSACTION"" (case-insensitive). We use `CONTAINS(UPPER(notification_type), ""TRANSACTION"")` for this.
3.  For the users who satisfy this condition, select their `uid` (user's unique identifier).
4.  Rename the output field to `user_id` as requested.
5.  Since we are starting from the `Users` collection and selecting `uid` (which is unique per user), the resulting list of user IDs will inherently be distinct.

```python

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the sessions into groups based on the `device_type`. Each unique `device_type` will form a group. The `name=""device_groups""` assigns a name to these partitioned groups, though it's not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` in this specific query structure.

1.  **`Transactions.PARTITION(name=""status_groups"", by=(status))`**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_status=status, status_count=COUNT(Transactions))`**:
    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` (i.e., for each unique transaction status):

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_by_users = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   Filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where `sender_type` is `0`, indicating the sender is a user.

        *   `sender_user_uid`: The unique ID (`uid`) of the sending user, obtained via `sending_user.uid`, which will be used for counting distinct users.

2.  `country_based_transactions = transactions_by_users.PARTITION(name=""country_tx_details"", by=(sender_country))`:
    *   Groups the `transactions_by_users` data by the `sender_country`. Each group (partition) will contain all transaction details (from the previous step) for users from a specific country. The sub-collection within each partition is named `country_tx_details`.

3.  `country_aggregates = country_based_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   Operates on each country group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `country_name = sender_country`: Selects the country name for the group.
    *   `total_amount_by_country = SUM(country_tx_details.transaction_val)`: Calculates the sum of all `transaction_val` (transaction amounts) within the current country group.
    *   `distinct_users_in_country = NDISTINCT(country_tx_details.sender_user_uid)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_user_uid` values within the current country group, effectively giving the number of distinct users who sent transactions from this country.

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We first select merchants who are `active` and whose `category` contains 'retail'. A case-insensitive check is used for 'retail'.
2.  **Get Latest Balances**: For each of these filtered merchants, we access their balance records. Since a merchant might have multiple balance entries over time (indicated by `updated_at` in the `MerchantBalances` collection), we need to find the most recent balance for each merchant. We achieve this using the `RANKING` window function, ranking balances by `updated_at` in descending order for each merchant. We select the balance record with rank 1. ""Today's"" balance is interpreted as the most current/latest balance, not necessarily a balance record that was updated on the literal current date.
3.  **Calculate Median**: From this collection of latest balance records (one per relevant merchant), we calculate the median of the `balance` amounts.

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To find the average user session duration in seconds, split by device_type, we can follow these steps:

1.  First, we access the `UserSessions` collection.
2.  For each session, we calculate its duration in seconds. This is done by finding the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` using the `DATEDIFF` function with ""seconds"" as the unit. We'll store this in a new calculated field, for example, `duration_in_seconds`.
3.  Next, we partition the sessions based on the `device_type`. This groups all sessions originating from the same device type together.
4.  Finally, for each `device_type` group, we calculate the average of the `duration_in_seconds` values.
5.  The result will show each `device_type` and its corresponding average user session duration in seconds.

Here's the PyDough code:
```python
# Calculate session duration in seconds for each user session
user_sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    # device_type is an existing field in UserSessions and will be carried over.
    # session_start_ts and session_end_ts are existing fields in UserSessions.
    duration_in_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)
)

# Partition by device_type and then calculate the average session duration for each type
result = user_sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(
    name=""sessions_grouped_by_device"", by=(device_type)
).CALCULATE(
    device_type = device_type,  # The device_type from the partition key
    avg_user_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds)  # Average of the calculated durations within each group
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `user_sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection where each record (session) has an additional field `duration_in_seconds`.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` calculates the difference between the session end and start timestamps in seconds. The `device_type` field from `UserSessions` is implicitly carried over to `user_sessions_with_duration`.

2.  `result = user_sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `user_sessions_with_duration` collection and applies `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""sessions_grouped_by_device""`: This names the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(device_type)`: This specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values of the `device_type` field.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these partition groups:
        *   `device_type = device_type`: Selects the `device_type` (which is the key of the current partition group).
        *   `avg_user_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_in_seconds` field for all sessions belonging to the current `device_type` group. The term `sessions_grouped_by_device.duration_in_seconds` refers to the `duration_in_seconds` values of the records within the named partition group.

The final `result` will contain records with two fields: `device_type` and `avg_user_session_duration_seconds`.",63.08261752128601,"# Calculate session duration in seconds for each user session

1.  Define a reusable expression, `earliest_coupon_record_expr`, to get the single earliest coupon for a merchant. This expression uses `RANKING` on the merchant's `coupons` sub-collection, sorted by `start_date`, and then `SINGULAR()` to pick the top one (ties broken arbitrarily by `allow_ties=False`).
2.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
3.  Filter out merchants who do not have any coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
4.  For the remaining merchants, use `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `merchant_identifier`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `merchant_registration_dt`.
    *   The ID of their earliest coupon (`cid`) as `earliest_coupon_identifier`, using `earliest_coupon_record_expr.cid`.
    *   The start date of their earliest coupon (`start_date`) as `earliest_coupon_start_dt`, using `earliest_coupon_record_expr.start_date`.
5.  Filter this intermediate result further using `WHERE`. A merchant is kept if their earliest coupon's start date (`earliest_coupon_start_dt`) is:
    *   On or after their registration date (`merchant_registration_dt`).
    *   On or before one year after their registration date. This is checked using `earliest_coupon_start_dt <= DATETIME(merchant_registration_dt, '1 year')`.
6.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` again to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `merchant_id`, `registration_date`, `earliest_coupon_id`, and `earliest_coupon_start_date`.
