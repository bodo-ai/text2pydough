**1. Function Selection & Justification:**

*   **`Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`**: We need to start by filtering the `Sales` collection to only include sales where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
*   **`.payment`**: After filtering sales, we need to access the related `PaymentsReceived` records using the `payment` sub-collection link.
*   **`CALCULATE(...)`**: This will be used multiple times:
    *   To calculate the start date of the week for each payment (`DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`).
    *   To calculate a flag indicating if a payment occurred on a weekend (`IFF(ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (1, 7)), 1, 0)` - assuming `DAYOFWEEK` returns 1 for Sunday and 7 for Saturday).
    *   To calculate how many weeks ago each payment occurred relative to the start of the current week (`DATEDIFF(""weeks"", ..., DATETIME('now', 'start of week'))`).
    *   Finally, after partitioning, to compute the aggregated counts (`COUNT` and `SUM`).
*   **`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`**: To get the reference point (start of the current week) for filtering the relevant weeks.
*   **`DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`**: To normalize payment dates to their corresponding week's start date for grouping.
*   **`DATEDIFF(""weeks"", ...)`**: To calculate the difference in weeks between the payment week and the current week.
*   **`WHERE(...)`**: To filter the payments to include only those that occurred between 1 and 8 weeks ago (inclusive), effectively excluding the current week.
*   **`DAYOFWEEK(payment_date)`**: To extract the day of the week from the `payment_date` (assuming standard numbering where Sunday=1, Saturday=7).
*   **`ISIN(..., (1, 7))`**: To check if the extracted day of the week falls on a weekend (Sunday or Saturday).
*   **`IFF(..., 1, 0)`**: To create the weekend payment flag (1 if weekend, 0 otherwise).
*   **`PARTITION(...)`**: This is essential for grouping the filtered payments by their respective week start dates (`week_start_date`).
*   **`COUNT(payments_per_week)`**: To count the total number of payments within each weekly partition.
*   **`SUM(payments_per_week.is_weekend)`**: To sum the weekend flags within each weekly partition, giving the count of weekend payments.
*   **`ORDER_BY(week_date.ASC())`**: To sort the final results by the week start date in ascending order.

**2. Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is necessary here to group payments by the week they occurred in. We will partition the filtered `PaymentsReceived` records by the calculated `week_start_date`.

**3. Code Generation:**

```python
# Define the start of the current week for reference
current_week_start = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')

# 1. Filter sales over $30k, access payments, calculate week info and weekend flag
payments_with_week_info = Sales.WHERE(
    sale_price > 30000

    payment_date=payment_date,
    # Calculate the start date of the week for each payment
    week_start_date=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week'),
    # Create a flag: 1 if payment was on Sunday (1) or Saturday (7), else 0
    # Assumption: DAYOFWEEK() returns 1 for Sunday, ..., 7 for Saturday
    is_weekend_payment=IFF(ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (1, 7)), 1, 0)
)

# 2. Filter payments to include only the last 8 weeks (excluding the current week)
payments_last_8_weeks = payments_with_week_info.CALCULATE(
    week_start_date=week_start_date,
    is_weekend_payment=is_weekend_payment,
    # Calculate how many full weeks ago the payment's week started compared to the current week's start
    weeks_ago=DATEDIFF(""weeks"", week_start_date, current_week_start)
).WHERE(
    # Keep only weeks that are 1 to 8 weeks ago
    (weeks_ago >= 1) & (weeks_ago <= 8)
)

weekly_payments_partitioned = PARTITION(
    payments_last_8_weeks,
    name='payments_in_week',

    week_date=week_start_date, # The partition key (start date of the week)
    total_payments_received=COUNT(payments_in_week), # Count all payments in this week's partition
    weekend_payments_received=SUM(payments_in_week.is_weekend_payment) # Sum the weekend flags
)

# 5. Order the results by week date ascending
final_weekly_payment_counts = weekly_summary.ORDER_BY(week_date.ASC())
```

**4. Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1.  **`current_week_start`**: We first determine the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. This serves as a reference point.
2.  **`payments_with_week_info`**: We start with the `Sales` collection, filter for records where `sale_price > 30000`, and then access their associated `payment` records (from `PaymentsReceived`). For each payment, we calculate its `week_start_date` using `DATETIME` and a flag `is_weekend_payment` using `IFF`, `ISIN`, and `DAYOFWEEK` to mark payments made on Saturdays or Sundays.
3.  **`payments_last_8_weeks`**: We take the results from the previous step and calculate `weeks_ago` for each payment by finding the difference in weeks between its `week_start_date` and the `current_week_start`. We then use `WHERE` to keep only payments where `weeks_ago` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), thus selecting the 8 full calendar weeks prior to the current one.
4.  **`weekly_payments_partitioned`**: We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered payments (`payments_last_8_weeks`) based on their `week_start_date`. Each group represents a specific week from the target range. The grouped data within each partition is accessible via the name `payments_in_week`.
5.  **`weekly_summary`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each partition (week), we select the `week_start_date` (aliased as `week_date`), count the total number of payments in that group using `COUNT(payments_in_week)`, and sum the `is_weekend_payment` flags using `SUM(payments_in_week.is_weekend_payment)` to get the count of weekend payments.
6.  **`final_weekly_payment_counts`**: Finally, we sort the weekly summaries using `ORDER_BY(week_date.ASC())` to present the results chronologically.","# Define the start of the current week for reference
current_week_start = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')

1.  `Salespersons`: This is the primary collection needed as we want to report results per salesperson.
2.  `CALCULATE`: Used to select the salesperson's ID, first name, last name, and to compute the count of recent sales.
3.  `COUNT`: An aggregation function required to count the number of sales records associated with each salesperson after filtering.
4.  `WHERE`: Used within the `COUNT` aggregation to filter the `sales_made` sub-collection, keeping only sales that occurred within the last 30 days.
5.  `DATETIME`: Used to determine the current date and calculate the date 30 days prior to filter the sales records. We use `'now'`, `'start of day'`, and `'-29 days'` to define the beginning of the 30-day period inclusive of today.
6.  `ORDER_BY`: Used to sort the final results based on the number of sales in descending order.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

`PARTITION` is not the most direct approach here. While we could partition `Sales` by `salesperson_id` after filtering by date, it would require an extra step to retrieve the salesperson's name details. Starting from the `Salespersons` collection and calculating the filtered count of `sales_made` is more straightforward and efficient.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Define the start date for the 30-day period (inclusive of today)
start_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of day', '-29 days')

# Calculate sales count per salesperson for the last 30 days
salesperson_recent_sales = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    salesperson_identifier=_id,
    first_name=first_name,
    last_name=last_name,
    num_sales_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_period_date))
).ORDER_BY(num_sales_last_30_days.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of day', '-29 days')`: This line defines the start date for our period of interest. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` gets the beginning of today (00:00:00). Subtracting 29 days (`'-29 days'`) gives us the timestamp for the start of the day exactly 29 days before today. Including sales from this timestamp onwards covers the last 30 days, inclusive of the current day.
2.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to shape the output for each salesperson.
3.  `salesperson_identifier=_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name`: These select the salesperson's ID, first name, and last name, renaming `_id` to `salesperson_identifier` for clarity.
4.  `num_sales_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_period_date))`: This calculates the number of sales for each salesperson within the desired timeframe.
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales associated with the current salesperson.
    *   `.WHERE(sale_date >= start_period_date)`: Filters these sales, keeping only those whose `sale_date` is on or after the calculated `start_period_date`.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales records remaining after the filter. This count is assigned to the new field `num_sales_last_30_days`.
5.  `.ORDER_BY(num_sales_last_30_days.DESC())`: Sorts the resulting collection of salespersons based on the `num_sales_last_30_days` field in descending order (highest count first).
6.  `salesperson_recent_sales = ...`: The final result is assigned to the variable `salesperson_recent_sales`.","# Define the start date for the 30-DAY period (inclusive of today)

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to count the number of 'Toyota' cars sold and sum their `sale_price` from the `Sales` collection. The sales must have occurred within the last 30 days, including today.
2.  **Database Structure**: We'll use the `Dealership` database. We need the `Sales` collection (for `sale_date`, `sale_price`, and the link to `car`) and the `Cars` collection (linked via `Sales.car` to filter by `make`).
3.  **Function Selection**:
    *   `WHERE`: To filter `Sales` records based on two conditions: the `car.make` being 'Toyota' and the `sale_date` falling within the specified date range.
    *   `DATETIME`: To define the start and end dates for our 30-day window. We'll use `'now'`, `'start of day'`, and date arithmetic (`'-29 days'`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_30_days_ago = DATETIME('now', 'start of day', '-29 days')`: Defines the beginning of the 30-day period by taking the current date, truncating it to the start of the day, and subtracting 29 days.

3.  `recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == 'Toyota'`: Selects only sales where the associated car's make is 'Toyota'.
    *   `(sale_date >= start_date_30_days_ago) & (sale_date <= today_date)`: Selects sales that occurred on or after the start date and on or before today's date.
4.  `toyota_sales_summary = GRAPH.CALCULATE(...)`: Performs aggregations on the filtered `recent_toyota_sales`.

2.  **Function Selection & Justification:**
    *   `Salespersons`: The starting collection containing salesperson details.

    *   The rank (`SR`) should be calculated globally across all salespersons based on `total_sales_amount` descending. `RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())` achieves this.

5.  **Code Generation:**

```python
# Calculate total sales amount and number of sales for each salesperson
salesperson_aggregates = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    sp_first_name=first_name,
    sp_last_name=last_name,
    total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price),
    sales_count=COUNT(sales_made)
)

# Calculate the sales rank (SR) based on total sales and select the final fields
salesperson_ranked_performance = salesperson_aggregates.CALCULATE(
    first_name=sp_first_name,
    last_name=sp_last_name,
    total_sales_amount=total_sales,
    number_of_sales=sales_count,
    SR=RANKING(by=total_sales.DESC())
)
```

6.  **Step-by-Step Explanation:**
    *   `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, it calculates:
        *   `sp_first_name`: Renames `first_name`.
        *   `sp_last_name`: Renames `last_name`.
        *   `total_sales`: Sums the `sale_price` from all related records in the `sales_made` sub-collection.
        *   `sales_count`: Counts the number of related records in the `sales_made` sub-collection.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Takes the result from the previous step. For each salesperson record (which now includes `sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`, `total_sales`, `sales_count`):
        *   `first_name=sp_first_name`: Selects the first name.
        *   `last_name=sp_last_name`: Selects the last name.
        *   `total_sales_amount=total_sales`: Selects the calculated total sales and renames it.
        *   `number_of_sales=sales_count`: Selects the calculated sales count and renames it.
        *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales.DESC())`: Calculates the rank (`SR`) for each salesperson based on their `total_sales` in descending order across all salespersons in the intermediate collection.

1.  **`Cars`, `InventorySnapshots`, `Sales`**: These collections are required to access car details, inventory status over time, and sales information, respectively.
2.  **`CALCULATE`**: Used multiple times:
    *   To determine the latest inventory snapshot for each car.
    *   To calculate the `is_in_inventory` status based on the latest snapshot.
    *   To select and potentially rename fields like `make`, `model`, and `sale_price` at various stages.
    *   To compute the final aggregated result (`highest_sale_price`) after partitioning.
3.  **`RANKING`**: Essential for reliably identifying the *latest* inventory snapshot for each car (`levels=1`). It ranks snapshots within each car's `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection based on `snapshot_date` descending. `allow_ties=True` handles cases where multiple snapshots might exist for the same latest date, although `SINGULAR` will pick one.
4.  **`SINGULAR`**: Used after `RANKING` and `WHERE` to convert the potentially single-row collection (containing the latest snapshot) into a singular record, allowing access to its `is_in_inventory` field.
5.  **`WHERE`**: Used twice:
    *   Inside the first `CALCULATE` to filter snapshots based on the rank determined by `RANKING`.
    *   After calculating the inventory status, to filter the `Cars` collection to include only those that have associated sales records (`HAS(sale_records) == 1`) and whose latest inventory status is `False`.
6.  **`HAS`**: Used within the second `WHERE` clause to ensure we only consider cars that have actually been sold (i.e., have at least one record in `sale_records`).
7.  **`PARTITION`**: Necessary to group the filtered sales records by the car's `make` and `model` so that we can aggregate sale prices within each group.
8.  **`MAX`**: An aggregation function used within the `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION` to find the highest `sale_price` for each `make`/`model` group.
9.  **`ORDER_BY`**: Used at the end to sort the final results based on the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is performed on the collection of relevant sales records (`sales_of_target_cars`). The partitioning keys are `car_make` and `car_model`, which represent the make and model of the car associated with each sale. This grouping allows the `MAX(sale_price)` aggregation to operate correctly for each unique make/model combination among the sold, out-of-inventory cars.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# 1. Calculate latest inventory status for each car
cars_with_status = Cars.CALCULATE(
    car_make=make,

# 6. Order the results by the highest sale price descending
highest_sales_per_make_model = max_sales_by_make_model.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The code first processes the `Cars` collection. For each car, it identifies the latest inventory snapshot using `RANKING` on `snapshot_date` within the `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection and selects that snapshot using `SINGULAR`.
2.  A second `CALCULATE` retrieves the `is_in_inventory` status from the identified latest snapshot and also checks if the car has any associated sales records using `HAS(sale_records)`.
3.  The `WHERE` clause filters these cars, keeping only those that have sales (`has_sales == True`) and are confirmed to be *not* in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`).
4.  It then accesses the `sale_records` for these filtered cars. A `CALCULATE` is used on these sales records to select the `sale_price` and carry forward the `car_make` and `car_model` from the parent car context.
5.  `PARTITION` groups these sales records based on the `car_make` and `car_model`.
6.  Within each partition group (`sales_group`), `CALCULATE` computes the maximum `sale_price` using the `MAX` aggregation function, assigning it to `highest_sale_price`. It also selects the `make` and `model` (which are the partitioning keys).
7.  Finally, `ORDER_BY` sorts the resulting collection of make/model/highest\_sale\_price records in descending order based on `highest_sale_price`.
8.  The final result is assigned to the variable `highest_sales_per_make_model`.","# 1. CALCULATE latest inventory status for each car

1.  **DATETIME**: Needed to calculate the start and end dates of the target 6-month period relative to the current time ('now'). We need the start of the month 6 months ago and the end of the previous month.
2.  **WHERE**: Used twice. First, to filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales within the calculated 6-month date range. Second, within the monthly aggregation, to filter sales further to include only those made by salespersons hired in the specified years (2022-2023).
3.  **YEAR**, **MONTH**: Required to extract the year and month from `sale_date` for partitioning, and to extract the year from `salesperson.hire_date` for filtering within the aggregation.
4.  **CALCULATE**: Used initially to add `sale_year`, `sale_month`, and `salesperson_hire_year` to the sales data. Used finally after partitioning to compute the required metrics (PMSPS, PMSR) and select the output fields (`year`, `month`, `PMSPS`, `PMSR`).
5.  **PARTITION**: Essential for grouping the sales data by month (`sale_year`, `sale_month`) so that monthly aggregates can be calculated.
6.  **COUNT**: Used within the final `CALCULATE` to count the number of relevant sales within each monthly partition (PMSPS).
7.  **SUM**: Used within the final `CALCULATE` to sum the `sale_price` of relevant sales within each monthly partition (PMSR).
8.  **DEFAULT_TO**: Used with `SUM` to ensure that if a month has no sales matching the criteria, the PMSR is reported as 0.0 instead of null.
9.  **ORDER_BY**: Used to sort the final results chronologically by year and then month.

**Partitioning Strategy:**

Partitioning is necessary to group sales by month. We will partition the `Sales` data (already filtered by the 6-month date range) using the calculated `sale_year` and `sale_month` as keys. This allows us to perform aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`) for each distinct month within the period. Inside the aggregation step after partitioning, we will further filter the sales within each month's group (`monthly_group`) to only include those made by salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023. This strategy ensures that we consider each month within the range that had *any* sales activity, and then calculate the specific metrics for the target salesperson group, resulting in 0 if they had no sales in that month.

**PyDough Code:**

```python
# Define the date range: last 6 full months excluding the current month
# Example: If today is July 15, 2024, start_date is Jan 1, 2024, end_date is June 30, 2024.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Calculation**: `start_date` and `end_date` are calculated to define the period covering the last 6 full calendar months prior to the current month.
2.  **Sales Data Preparation**: The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only sales that occurred within the calculated `start_date` and `end_date`. Then, `CALCULATE` is used to extract the `sale_year` and `sale_month` from the `sale_date`, retain the `sale_price`, and importantly, retrieve the `hire_date` year (`salesperson_hire_year`) from the linked `Salespersons` record via the `salesperson` relationship.
3.  **Monthly Partitioning**: The prepared sales data (`sales_data_with_details`) is partitioned using `PARTITION` based on the `sale_year` and `sale_month`. This groups all sales from the period into distinct monthly buckets. The group for each month is accessible via the name `monthly_group`.
4.  **Metric Calculation**: A final `CALCULATE` is applied to the partitioned data. For each partition (i.e., each month):
    *   The `year` and `month` (partition keys) are selected.
    *   An intermediate collection `target_sales_in_month` is created by filtering the `monthly_group` using `WHERE` to keep only those sales where the `salesperson_hire_year` is between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive).
    *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) is calculated by applying `COUNT` to `target_sales_in_month`.
    *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated by applying `SUM` to the `sale_price` within `target_sales_in_month`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if there were no sales by the target group in a given month (resulting in a null sum), PMSR will be 0.0.
5.  **Ordering**: The final result set is ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY` first by `year` and then by `month`.
6.  **Result Assignment**: The computed monthly metrics are assigned to the variable `result`.

This code calculates the required metrics for each month within the specified 6-month window, specifically for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023. It includes months where these specific salespersons made zero sales (showing PMSPS=0 and PMSR=0.0), provided there was at least one sale by *any* salesperson in that month during the period.","# Define the date range: last 6 full months excluding the current MONTH

1.  **Goal**: Calculate the total payments received for each month and the Month-over-Month (MoM) change. Include all months, even those with no payments.
2.  **Data Source**: We need the `PaymentsReceived` collection, specifically the `payment_date` and `payment_amount` columns.
3.  **Monthly Aggregation**: To get totals per month, we need to extract the year and month from `payment_date` and then group by these values.
    *   `YEAR(payment_date)` and `MONTH(payment_date)` functions are needed.
    *   `PARTITION` is the appropriate function to group the data by year and month.
    *   `SUM(payment_amount)` is needed to calculate the total amount within each group (month).
4.  **MoM Calculation**: This requires comparing a month's total with the *previous* month's total. The standard way to do this in SQL-like languages is using a `LAG` window function. Based on the provided PyDough reference, there isn't an equivalent `LAG` function to directly access the previous row's value in an ordered set. Therefore, calculating the MoM change `(current_month_total - previous_month_total)` within a single standard PyDough query is not feasible with the documented functions.
5.  **Including All Months**: The request to include months with zero payments implies needing a complete sequence of months within the data's time range and then joining the actual payment data. PyDough, as per the reference, primarily operates on existing data points and doesn't have a built-in mechanism to generate such a date scaffold and perform an outer join. The result will only include months that have at least one payment record.

**Conclusion**: We can calculate the total payments for each month *that has payments*. However, calculating the MoM change and including months with zero payments are not directly supported by the standard functions described in the PyDough reference.

**PyDough Code for Monthly Totals**:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate year and month for each payment received record
payments_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(
    payment_year=YEAR(payment_date),
    payment_month=MONTH(payment_date),
    payment_amt=payment_amount  # Keep amount for summation
)

# Step 2: Partition by year and month, then calculate the sum of payments for each group
monthly_payment_totals = PARTITION(
    payments_info,
    name='payments_per_month_group',
    by=(payment_year, payment_month)
).CALCULATE(
    year=payment_year,
    month=payment_month,
    total_payments_received=SUM(payments_per_month_group.payment_amt)
).ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC()) # Order chronologically

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = monthly_payment_totals
```

**Explanation**:

1.  `payments_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`: This selects the `PaymentsReceived` collection and calculates two new fields, `payment_year` and `payment_month`, by extracting the year and month from the `payment_date`. It also selects the `payment_amount` and renames it to `payment_amt` for clarity in the next step.
2.  `monthly_payment_totals = PARTITION(...)`: This takes the `payments_info` data and partitions (groups) it.
    *   `name='payments_per_month_group'`: Assigns a name to access the data within each partition.
    *   `by=(payment_year, payment_month)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique combinations of year and month.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operates on each partition created.
    *   `year=payment_year, month=payment_month`: Selects the year and month identifiers for the group. Note we use `payment_year` and `payment_month` directly as they are the partitioning keys.
    *   `total_payments_received=SUM(payments_per_month_group.payment_amt)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amt` for all records within the current partition (i.e., for the specific year and month) using the partition name `payments_per_month_group`.
4.  `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result chronologically by year and then by month.
5.  `result = monthly_payment_totals`: Assigns the final calculated collection to the variable `result`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes two aggregated values for each salesperson:
    *   `total_sales_amount`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales linked to the salesperson (`sales_made`).
    *   `number_of_sales`: The count of sales linked to the salesperson.
    *   It also carries forward `first_name` and `last_name` under temporary names (`sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`).
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first step and computes:
    *   `ASP`: The Average Selling Price, calculated as `total_sales_amount / number_of_sales`. The `IFF` function ensures that if `number_of_sales` is 0, `ASP` is set to 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   It also renames `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name` back to `first_name` and `last_name` for the final output.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=ASP.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 records from the result of the previous `CALCULATE` operation, ordered by the calculated `ASP` in descending order (highest ASP first). The final result contains the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ASP` for these top 3 salespersons.","# CALCULATE total sales amount and number of sales for each salesperson

    4.  Navigate from `Salespersons` to `sales_made` (their sales) and then to `payment` (payments received for those sales).
    5.  Apply an inner `WHERE` clause on the `payment` sub-collection to filter for records where `payment_method` is exactly 'Cash'.
    6.  The `HAS(...) == 1` condition evaluates to true for any salesperson who has made at least one sale for which a cash payment was received.

1.  **Goal**: Find the top 5 car models by total sales revenue.
2.  **Data Needed**:
    *   Car make and model (`Cars` collection).
    *   Sale price for each sale (`Sales` collection).
    *   Link between cars and sales (`Cars.sale_records` or `Sales.car`).
3.  **Approach**:
    *   We need to group cars by their `make` and `model`. `PARTITION` is suitable for this.
    *   For each group (make/model combination), we need to calculate the total revenue (`SUM` of `sale_price` from associated sales) and the total number of sales (`COUNT` of associated sales). This will be done within a `CALCULATE` after the `PARTITION`.
    *   Finally, we need to select the top 5 groups based on the calculated `total_revenue`. `TOP_K` is the correct function for this.

**Function Selection:**

*   `PARTITION`: To group the `Cars` collection by `make` and `model`.
*   `CALCULATE`: To compute the aggregated `total_revenue` and `total_sales_count` for each group defined by `PARTITION`.
*   `SUM`: To aggregate the `sale_price` within each group.
*   `COUNT`: To count the number of sales within each group.
*   `TOP_K`: To select the top 5 groups based on `total_revenue`.

```python
# Partition the Cars collection by make and model
# For each group, calculate the total revenue and total number of sales
model_revenue_and_sales = PARTITION(
    Cars,
    name='car_group',  # Name for the partitioned group
    by=(make, model)  # Partition keys
).CALCULATE(
    car_make=make,  # Select the make (partition key)
    car_model=model,  # Select the model (partition key)
    # Calculate total revenue by summing sale_price from all sales records in the group
    total_revenue=SUM(car_group.sale_records.sale_price),
    # Calculate total sales count by counting all sales records in the group
    total_sales_count=COUNT(car_group.sale_records)

)

# Assign the final result to a variable
result = top_5_selling_models

**Explanation:**

1.  `PARTITION(Cars, name='car_group', by=(make, model))`: This groups all records in the `Cars` collection based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group is accessible via the name `car_group`.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on each group created by `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make, car_model=model`: Selects the `make` and `model` for each group (these are the partition keys).
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(car_group.sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records (`sale_records`) associated with the cars belonging to the current `car_group` (make/model combination).
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(car_group.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of sales records associated with the cars in the current `car_group`.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (one record per make/model combination with its total revenue and sales count) and selects the top 5 records based on the `total_revenue` field in descending order.
4.  `result = top_5_selling_models`: Assigns the final collection, containing the top 5 models with their make, model, total sales count, and total revenue, to the `result` variable.","# PARTITION the Cars collection by make and model

1.  **Analyze the Input**: We need to count the number of payments from the `PaymentsMade` collection where the `vendor_name` is 'Utility Company' and the `payment_date` falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday).

    *   `ISIN`: To check if the extracted day of the week is either 6 or 7.
    *   `COUNT`: To count the number of payments that satisfy both filter conditions.
    *   `Dealership.CALCULATE`: To wrap the final count into a result collection with a named field.
3.  **Partitioning Strategy**: `PARTITION` is not required here as we are performing a simple filter and count across the entire `PaymentsMade` collection.
4.  **Ranking Considerations**: `RANKING` is not needed for this query.
5.  **Handling Ambiguity**: We assume a `DAYOFWEEK` function exists and returns 6 for Saturday and 7 for Sunday. If the function behaves differently or doesn't exist, the query would need adjustment.

    *   `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This condition filters for payments where the `vendor_name` is exactly 'Utility Company'.
    *   `ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date), (6, 7))`: This condition first extracts the day of the week from the `payment_date` (assuming `DAYOFWEEK` function exists and Sat=6, Sun=7) and then checks if this day falls within the tuple `(6, 7)`, effectively selecting weekend payments.
    *   `&`: This combines the two conditions, ensuring only payments meeting both criteria are selected.
    *   `result_count = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This line uses the top-level `Dealership` graph to perform a final calculation.
    *   `num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(utility_weekend_payments)`: Inside the `CALCULATE`, it counts the number of records in the previously filtered `utility_weekend_payments` collection and assigns the result to a new field named `num_weekend_utility_payments`.

    *   `CALCULATE`: Prepares the data for partitioning by extracting the day from `payment_date` and selecting the necessary fields (`payment_method`, `payment_amount`). It's also used after `PARTITION` to structure the final output.
    *   `PARTITION`: Groups the filtered and prepared payment records by the calculated `payment_day` and the `payment_method`.
    *   `SUM`: Aggregates the `payment_amount` within each partition group (each day and payment method combination).

*   **Step-by-Step Explanation**:
    1.  `start_of_current_iso_week`, `start_of_previous_iso_week`, `end_of_previous_iso_week`: These contextless expressions calculate the date boundaries for the entire previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday) relative to the current date. It assumes `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` correctly identifies the start of the ISO week (Monday).
    2.  `payments_prev_week_prepared`: This variable filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection using `WHERE` to keep only payments whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week. It then uses `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Create `payment_day` by truncating `payment_date` to its day component using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This is needed for daily grouping.
        *   Select `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for further processing.
    3.  `daily_totals_by_method_prev_week`: This variable takes the prepared payments and applies `PARTITION`.

1.  **Goal**: Calculate total quarterly sales for 2023, grouped by customer state. Represent quarters by their start date.
2.  **Data Needed**: Sales data (`Sales` collection), specifically `sale_date`, `sale_price`, and the associated customer's state (`Customers` collection via `Sales.customer`).
3.  **Steps**:
    *   Filter `Sales` records for the year 2023.
    *   For each sale, determine the customer's state.
    *   For each sale, determine the starting date of the quarter it belongs to (e.g., Q1 -> 2023-01-01, Q2 -> 2023-04-01, etc.).
    *   Group the filtered sales by customer state and the calculated quarter start date.
    *   Sum the `sale_price` within each group.
4.  **PyDough Functions**:
    *   `WHERE`: To filter sales by year (`YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`).
    *   `CALCULATE`: To extract the customer state (`customer.state`), calculate the quarter start date, and select the sale price.
    *   `MONTH`: To get the month from `sale_date` for quarter calculation.
    *   `datetime.date`: To construct the quarter start date. We can calculate the starting month of the quarter using `((MONTH(sale_date) - 1) // 3) * 3 + 1`.
    *   `PARTITION`: To group the results by state and quarter start date.
    *   `SUM`: To aggregate the `sale_price` for each group.

```python
# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and calculate necessary intermediate fields
sales_filtered_calculated = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(
    # Extract customer state
    cust_state=customer.state,
    # Calculate the starting month number of the quarter (1, 4, 7, 10)
    quarter_start_month=((MONTH(sale_date) - 1) // 3) * 3 + 1,
    # Keep the sale price for aggregation
    sale_value=sale_price
)

# Step 2: Calculate the actual quarter start date using the calculated month
sales_with_quarter_date = sales_filtered_calculated.CALCULATE(
    cust_state=cust_state,
    # Construct the date for the start of the quarter in 2023
    qtr_start_date=datetime.date(2023, quarter_start_month, 1),
    sale_value=sale_value
)

# Step 3: Partition by state and quarter start date, then aggregate sales
quarterly_sales_by_state = PARTITION(
    sales_with_quarter_date,
    name='state_quarter_group',
    by=(cust_state, qtr_start_date)
).CALCULATE(
    # Select the grouping keys: state and quarter start date
    state=cust_state,
    quarter_start=qtr_start_date,
    # Calculate the total sales for the group
    total_sales=SUM(state_quarter_group.sale_value)

# Optional: Order results for better readability
# quarterly_sales_by_state = quarterly_sales_by_state.ORDER_BY(state.ASC(), quarter_start.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only records from the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The first `CALCULATE` extracts the customer's state (`customer.state`), calculates the starting month number of the quarter based on the `sale_date`, and selects the `sale_price`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` uses the `quarter_start_month` calculated previously to construct the actual start date of the quarter using `datetime.date(2023, quarter_start_month, 1)`.
4.  `PARTITION(...)`: Groups the results from the previous step. It partitions the data based on the combination of `cust_state` and the calculated `qtr_start_date`. The grouped data within each partition is accessible via the name `state_quarter_group`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Operates on each partition group. It selects the `cust_state` (renamed to `state`) and `qtr_start_date` (renamed to `quarter_start`) which are the partitioning keys. It then calculates the `total_sales` for each group by summing the `sale_value` of all records within that `state_quarter_group`.
6.  The final result `quarterly_sales_by_state` contains the customer state, the start date of each quarter in 2023, and the total sales amount for that state and quarter.","# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and CALCULATE necessary intermediate fields

    *   `WHERE`: To filter `InventorySnapshots` based on the month and year of `snapshot_date`, the calculated latest date, and the `is_in_inventory` status.
    *   `MONTH`, `YEAR`: To extract the month and year from the `snapshot_date` for filtering.
    *   `MAX`: To determine the latest `snapshot_date` among all snapshots taken in March 2023.
    *   `CALCULATE`: Used at the `Dealership` graph level to compute the overall latest snapshot date for March 2023. Also used at the end to select the required fields from the `Cars` collection.
    *   `.car`: To navigate from the filtered `InventorySnapshots` records to their corresponding `Cars` records.

*   **Partitioning Strategy:** `PARTITION` is not required because the query involves filtering based on a calculated maximum date for a specific period (March 2023) and a boolean flag, rather than grouping data by specific keys.

*   **Ranking Considerations:** `RANKING` is not the most suitable approach here. While it could find the latest snapshot per car, the requirement is to find cars present in the *single latest snapshot* taken during March 2023 overall. Calculating the maximum date directly is more appropriate.

```python
# Calculate the latest snapshot date specifically for March 2023
latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    latest_date_in_march_2023=MAX(
        InventorySnapshots.WHERE(
            (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3) & (YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)

).car.CALCULATE(
    car_id=_id,
    car_make=make,
    car_model=model,
    car_year=year
)
```

*   **Explanation:**
    1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the maximum `snapshot_date` found within the `InventorySnapshots` collection, but only considering snapshots where the month is March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) and the year is 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). This maximum date is stored in the variable `latest_date_in_march_2023`.
    2.  `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We start from the `InventorySnapshots` collection, inheriting the calculated `latest_date_in_march_2023`.
    3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the snapshots based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   `snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023`: It keeps only the snapshots taken exactly on the latest date found in step 1.
        *   `is_in_inventory == True`: It further filters these snapshots to include only those where the `is_in_inventory` flag is explicitly True.
    4.  `.car`: For the filtered snapshots, it navigates to the associated `Cars` records.
    5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Finally, for these specific cars, it selects and renames the required fields: `_id` as `car_id`, `make` as `car_make`, `model` as `car_model`, and `year` as `car_year`.","# CALCULATE the latest snapshot date specifically for March 2023
