1. **Analysis of the question:**
   The question asks to find customers who have made at least 5 transactions in total, and then calculate the success rate for these customers. The success rate is likely defined as the ratio of successful transactions to the total number of transactions for each customer. The results should be ordered from lowest to highest success rate.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   a. Start with the Customers collection
   b. Filter to include only customers with at least 5 transactions
   c. Calculate the number of successful transactions for each customer (where status equals 'success')
   d. Calculate the total number of transactions for each customer
   e. Calculate the success rate as (successful transactions / total transactions)
   f. Return the customer name and the success rate
   g. Order the results by success rate in ascending order

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block:**
```python
customer_transaction_info = Customers.WHERE(
    COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    success_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'success'))
).CALCULATE(
    success_rate=success_transactions / total_transactions
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - The code starts with the `Customers` collection.
   - It filters these customers to only include those who have at least 5 transactions (`COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5`).
   - It calculates:
     - The customer's name
     - The total number of transactions made by each customer
     - The number of successful transactions for each customer (where the transaction status equals 'success')
   - It then calculates the success rate as the number of successful transactions divided by the total number of transactions.
   - Finally, it orders the results by success rate in ascending order, so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.

Pydough Code:
customer_transaction_info = Customers.WHERE(
    COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    success_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'success'))
).CALCULATE(
    success_rate=success_transactions / total_transactions
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())

Code Context:
# Explanation of PyDough Code for Customer Transaction Success Rate

## Code Overview

```python
customer_transaction_info = Customers.WHERE(
    COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    success_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'success'))
).CALCULATE(
    success_rate=success_transactions / total_transactions
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

This PyDough code answers the question ""For customers with at least 5 total transactions, what is their transaction success rate? Return the customer name and success rate, ordered from lowest to highest success rate."" Let me explain how it works.

## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### 1. WHERE Operation
The code starts with:
```python
Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)
```
This filters the `Customers` collection to only include those who have made at least 5 transactions. The `WHERE` operation [8ba9c9e] is used to filter records based on a condition.

### 2. CALCULATE Operation
Multiple `CALCULATE` operations are used:
```python
).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    success_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'success'))
)
.CALCULATE(
    success_rate=success_transactions / total_transactions
)
```

The `CALCULATE` operation [988171e] is used to derive new fields, rename existing ones, or select specific fields from a collection. It allows for transforming and aggregating data.

### 3. COUNT Aggregation Function
The code uses the `COUNT` function to count transactions [988171e]:
```python
COUNT(transactions_made)
COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'success'))
```

This counts the number of records in the `transactions_made` collection, both in total and for only those with status 'success'.

### 4. WHERE with COUNT for Sub-Collection Filtering
The code uses a `WHERE` clause with `COUNT` to filter a sub-collection [8ba9c9e]:
```python
transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'success')
```

This filters the `transactions_made` sub-collection to only include records where the status is 'success'.

### 5. ORDER_BY Operation
The code ends with:
```python
.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

This sorts the results in ascending order based on the success rate [988171e].

### 6. Hierarchical Thinking Model
The code demonstrates PyDough's hierarchical thinking model by navigating from `Customers` to their `transactions_made` sub-collection [76a7d9e]. This allows for expressing relationships and aggregations in a natural way.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this flow:
1. Start with the `Customers` collection
2. Filter to only include customers with at least 5 transactions
3. Calculate:
   - customer_name (renamed from the `name` field)
   - total_transactions (count of all transactions made)
   - success_transactions (count of successful transactions)
4. Calculate the success rate as success_transactions / total_transactions
5. Sort the results by success rate in ascending order

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Composability**: The code builds upon previous calculations [988171e], first calculating the counts, then the success rate in a separate `CALCULATE` step.

2. **Meaningful variable names**: Variables like `customer_transaction_info`, `success_transactions`, and `success_rate` clearly indicate what data they contain [988171e].

3. **Hierarchical navigation**: The code uses dot notation (`Customers.transactions_made`) to navigate through relationships, which is a key advantage of PyDough over SQL [76a7d9e].

4. **Chaining operations**: Operations are chained together in a readable sequence [988171e].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:
1. Using collection names with plural capitalization (Customers, transactions_made) [988171e]
2. Using proper PyDough operations (`WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, `ORDER_BY`) with correct syntax [988171e]
3. Using the aggregation function `COUNT` to count records in sub-collections [988171e]
4. Using the `.ASC()` modifier for sorting [988171e]
5. Following the pattern of filtering first, then performing calculations [988171e]

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the original question by:
1. Identifying customers with at least 5 total transactions using `WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`
2. Calculating each customer's transaction success rate using `success_transactions / total_transactions`
3. Returning the customer name and success rate with appropriate field names
4. Sorting the results from lowest to highest success rate using `ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`

The code is concise and readable, demonstrating how PyDough's hierarchical approach can express complex data relationships in a natural way.",12.75373888015747,.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC()),"cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1758 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=1758)] prompt_token_count=17997 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=17997)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=19755 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

distinct_customer_ids = PARTITION(customer_transactions, name=""transactions"", by=(customer_id))

result = TPCH.CALCULATE(n_distinct_customers=COUNT(distinct_customer_ids))
```

Explanation:
The code first defines a collection `faang_tickers` by filtering the `Tickers` collection to include only those ticker symbols that contain ""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", or ""NFLX"".
Then, it creates a collection `customers_with_com_email` by filtering the `Customers` collection to include only customers with email addresses ending in "".com"".
Next, it creates a collection `customer_transactions` by filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that involve tickers from the `faang_tickers` collection and customers from the `customers_with_com_email` collection.
The code then creates a collection `distinct_customer_ids` that contains the distinct customer IDs from the `customer_transactions` collection using the `PARTITION` operation.
Finally, it creates a collection `result` by counting the number of distinct customer IDs using the `COUNT` aggregation function.

Pydough Code:
```python
faang_tickers = Tickers.WHERE(
    CONTAINS(symbol, ""AMZN"")
    | CONTAINS(symbol, ""AAPL"")
    | CONTAINS(symbol, ""GOOGL"")
    | CONTAINS(symbol, ""META"")
    | CONTAINS(symbol, ""NFLX"")
).CALCULATE(ticker_id=id)

customers_with_com_email = Customers.WHERE(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))

customer_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(
    ISIN(ticker_id, faang_tickers.ticker_id)
    & ISIN(customer_id, customers_with_com_email.id)
).CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)

distinct_customer_ids = PARTITION(customer_transactions, name=""transactions"", by=(customer_id))

result = TPCH.CALCULATE(n_distinct_customers=COUNT(distinct_customer_ids))
```

Pydough Analysis:
1. **Tickers Collection**: The code starts by filtering tickers that belong to FAANG companies using the `WHERE` clause with a combination of `CONTAINS` functions. It then uses `CALCULATE` to include only the ticker ID.

2. **Customers Collection**: It filters customers to only include those with email addresses ending in "".com"" using the `WHERE` clause with the `ENDSWITH` function.

3. **Transactions Collection**: It filters transactions to only include those involving FAANG tickers and customers with "".com"" email addresses using the `WHERE` clause with `ISIN` function.

4. **Distinct Customer IDs**: It creates distinct customer IDs using the `PARTITION` operation with the `by=(customer_id)` clause.

5. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the count of distinct customers using the `COUNT` function on the partitioned data.

Data Flow:
The data flows from:
1. Tickers collection → filtered FAANG tickers → calculated ticker IDs
2. Customers collection → filtered customers with "".com"" email addresses
3. Transactions collection → filtered transactions → transactions with FAANG tickers and "".com"" email customers → extracted customer IDs
4. Partitioned customer IDs → distinct count of customers

Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated:
1. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations like `WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, and `PARTITION` in a readable sequence.

2. **Using helper collections**: The code creates helper collections like `faang_tickers` and `customers_with_com_email` to make the logic clear.

3. **Proper use of PARTITION**: The code uses `PARTITION` to create distinct values for customer IDs, which is a proper use case for this operation.

4. **Using appropriate aggregation functions**: The code uses `COUNT` to count the number of distinct customers, which is appropriate for this scenario.

5. **Proper use of ISIN**: The code correctly uses `ISIN` to check for membership in a collection, as recommended in the documentation.

How This Code Follows Pydough Conventions:
The code follows Pydough conventions by:
1. Using dot notation to access subcollections (e.g., `Tickers.historical_prices`)
2. Using appropriate operations like `WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, and `PARTITION`
3. Using appropriate functions like `CONTAINS`, `ENDSWITH`, `ISIN`, and `COUNT`
4. Following the proper syntax for operations and functions, including required parameters
5. Using clear and descriptive variable names

How the Code Addresses the Original Question:
The code addresses the original question by:
1. Identifying FAANG stocks through ticker symbols
2. Identifying customers with "".com"" email addresses
3. Finding transactions that match both criteria
4. Counting the distinct customers who meet these criteria

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter Customers**: First, we filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined on or after January 1, 2023, storing this in `customers_2023`. The `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"")` function converts the string ""2023-01-01"" to a proper datetime object for comparison.

2. **Prepare Customer Data**: We then select the key, country, and name fields from the filtered customers.

3. **Count Active Customers by Country**: We use the `PARTITION` operation to group these customers by their country. For each country, we calculate the count of active customers (`tac`) using the `COUNT` aggregation function. The `name=""cust_info""` parameter gives the sub-collection being partitioned a name.

4. **Final Calculation and Sorting**: Finally, we create the result by selecting the country and its count of active customers, and sort the result by country in ascending order.

This approach directly addresses the question by:
- Filtering to the relevant customer subset (joined after Jan 1, 2023)
- Grouping by country
- Counting active customers within each country

# Code Explanation

The PyDough code answers the question by:

1. First obtaining the date of the end of the current week using `DATETIME(today(), 'end of week')` to establish an upper bound for the date range.
2. Then calculating the date 8 weeks prior to this date using `DATETIME(current_week_end, '-8 weeks')` to establish a lower bound for the date range.
3. Defining a helper function `is_weekend()` that checks if a given date falls on a Saturday (6) or Sunday (7) based on the `DAYOFWEEK()` function.
4. Filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified 8-week period.
5. Counting the total number of these recent transactions using `COUNT(recent_transactions)`.
6. Filtering the recent transactions further to only include those that occurred on weekends using the helper function and counting these.
7. Subtracting the weekend count from the total to determine the number of weekday transactions.
8. Finally, creating a result collection with the total, weekend, and weekday counts using `GRAPH.CALCULATE()`.

This approach efficiently answers the original question by first defining the date range and weekend check, then filtering and counting the transactions accordingly, and finally presenting the results in an organized manner.",5.509800910949707,"# Calculate the end date of the current week

    amount=SUM(amount)
)

result = TPCH.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions),
    total_amount=SUM(transactions.amount)
)
```

## Explanation of PyDough Code

### 1. Date Calculation
```python
today = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
seven_days_ago = DATETIME(today, '-7 D')
```
This section calculates the date exactly one week ago by subtracting 7 days from the current timestamp using the DATETIME function. The CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function captures the current date and time. The expression `-7 D` subtracts seven days from this date, giving us the start date for the exclusive ""last week"" period.

### 2. Customer Filtering
```python
usa_customers = Broker.Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")
```
This line filters the `Customers` collection to only include customers whose country is ""USA"". This creates a subset collection of US customers.

### 3. Transaction Filtering and Aggregation
```python
transactions = usa_customers.transactions_made.WHERE(date_time < seven_days_ago).CALCULATE(
    transaction_id,
    amount=SUM(amount)
)
```
Here, the code accesses the `transactions_made` subcollection of the `usa_customers` collection and filters it to include only transactions where the transaction date is before the calculated `seven_days_ago` date (excluding transactions from the current week). The code then calculates the sum of the transaction amounts for each transaction.

### 4. Result Calculation
```python
result = TPCH.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions),
    total_amount=SUM(transactions.amount)
)
```
This final step calculates:
- The total number of transactions made by US customers in the last week (excluding current week)
- The total amount of these transactions

The result is a collection with two fields: `num_transactions` and `total_amount`.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through several transformations:

1. Start with the `Customers` collection from the `Broker` graph.
2. Filter to keep only customers from the USA.
3. Access the `transactions_made` subcollection for these customers.
4. Filter transactions to include only those occurring before the calculated 7-day mark.
5. Group these transactions by their ID and calculate their sums.
6. Calculate the final result including the count of transactions and their total amount.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Variables like `usa_customers` and `transactions` clearly indicate what data they contain [988171e].

2. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The code uses PyDough's hierarchical document model approach to navigate from customers to their transactions [8ad9c9f].

3. **Stepwise Transformation**: The code breaks down the problem into logical steps:
   - First filter customers by country
   - Then filter transactions by date
   - Finally aggregate results [988171e].

4. **Appropriate Use of WHERE**: The code uses `WHERE` to filter data at different stages of the pipeline [0ed992c].

5. **Appropriate Use of SUM and COUNT**: The code correctly uses `SUM` to add numerical values and `COUNT` to count records [eb91a8c].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Hierarchical Navigation**: The code navigates from `Broker.Customers` to their `transactions_made` subcollection, demonstrating proper hierarchical thinking [988171e].

2. **Collection Access**: The code properly accesses subcollections using dot notation (e.g., `Customers.WHERE(...).transactions_made`) [0ed992c].

3. **Filtering with WHERE**: The code uses `WHERE` clauses to filter collections at appropriate points in the data flow [0ed992c].

4. **Aggregation Functions**: The code correctly uses aggregation functions like `SUM` and `COUNT` to derive summary metrics [eb91a8c].

5. **Date Handling**: The code demonstrates proper date handling with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` and `DATETIME` for creating date objects and performing date arithmetic [988171e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for:
1. The number of transactions made by customers from the USA
2. The total transaction amount
3. Transactions within the last week (exclusive of the current week)

The code addresses these points by:

Code Explanation:
The code first calculates customer-level metrics including name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount. Then, it assigns a rank to each customer based on their total transaction amount, with ties allowed.

PyDough Code:
customer_data = customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)
)
customer_data = customer_data.CALCULATE(
    CR=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC(), allow_ties=True)
)

Code Context:
This PyDough code answers the user's question by:
1. Calculating customer metrics (name, transaction count, total amount)
2. Ranking customers by total transaction amount to determine CR
3. Providing all requested fields in the final result

Pydough Code:
customer_data = customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)
)
customer_data = customer_data.CALCULATE(
    CR=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC(), allow_ties=True)
)

Code Rationale:
The code follows PyDough best practices by:
1. Using CALCULATE to create new fields and derive metrics from related collections
2. Using COUNT on a plural sub-collection (transactions_made) to count records
3. Using SUM on a numerical field in a plural sub-collection to aggregate transaction amounts
4. Using RANKING with DESC to rank customers by transaction amount
5. Setting allow_ties=True to handle multiple customers with the same rank

PyDough Functions and Patterns Used:
1. CALCULATE: Used to create new fields and derive metrics
2. COUNT: Aggregation function to count records in a sub-collection
3. SUM: Aggregation function to sum numerical values in a sub-collection
4. RANKING: Window function to assign ranks based on a specified metric
5. DESC: Sorting modifier to specify descending order
6. allow_ties=True: Argument to RANKING to handle ties in ranking

Data Flow:
1. Start with customers collection
2. Calculate name, transaction count, and total transaction amount for each customer
3. Rank customers by total transaction amount to determine CR
4. Return the customer data with all requested fields

Pydough Conventions:
The code follows PyDough conventions by:
1. Using dot notation to access related collections (customers.transactions_made)
2. Using COUNT and SUM as aggregation functions on plural sub-collections
3. Using the ranking function with appropriate parameters
4. Using descriptive variable names

Logical Document Model:
The code leverages the hierarchical document model of PyDough:
1. It starts with the customers collection, which has a one-to-many relationship with transactions_made
2. It uses CALCULATE to derive metrics from the transactions_made sub-collection
3. It applies rankings to the entire customer collection based on these derived metrics

Data Transformations:
The code performs two key transformations:
1. From customer record to customer metrics (name, transaction count, total amount)
2. From customer records to customer ranks based on total transaction amount

Code Clarity:
The code is clear and concise, directly reflecting the user's request. It uses descriptive variable names (customer_name, num_transactions, etc.) and follows a logical flow:
1. First calculate basic metrics
2. Then rank based on those metrics

Testing Strategy:
A good testing strategy would include:
1. Unit tests for individual functions like RANKING
2. Integration tests to ensure data flows correctly through the pipeline
3. End-to-end tests with sample data to verify the results match expectations
4. Boundary case tests (e.g., what happens with customers who have zero transactions)

1. Filter transactions to only include transactions from the past 10 days
2. Group the transactions by ticker symbol
3. Count the number of buy transactions for each ticker
4. Sort by the number of buy transactions in descending order
5. Take the top 2

Here's the PyDough code:

    buy_count=COUNT(tickers.transaction_id)
)

result = ticker_counts.TOP_K(2, by=buy_count.DESC())
```

Explanation:

1. `recent_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10)`: This filters the Transactions collection to include only transactions from the past 10 days.

2. `buy_transactions = recent_transactions.WHERE(transaction_type == ""BUY"")`: This further filters the recent transactions to include only those of type ""BUY"".

3. `ticker_counts = buy_transactions.PARTITION(name=""tickers"", by=ticker_id).CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol, buy_count=COUNT(tickers.transaction_id))`: This partitions the buy transactions by ticker_id, and then for each ticker calculates the ticker symbol and the count of buy transactions for that ticker.

4. `result = ticker_counts.TOP_K(2, by=buy_count.DESC())`: This takes the top 2 tickers based on the count of buy transactions, sorted in descending order.

The code follows the PyDough best practices:

### Explanation:

1.  **Variable Definitions**:
    *   `six_months_ago`: Calculates the date 6 months prior to the current date using `DATETIME('now', '- 6 months')`.
    *   `current_month_start`: Calculates the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.

2.  **Monthly Customer Data**:
    *   The `Customers.CALCULATE()` operation creates a new collection with an aggregated month-year field (`month_year`). This field combines the year and month of each customer's join date, separated by a hyphen.

3.  **Partition and Aggregate Data**:
    *   The collection is then partitioned by `month_year` using `PARTITION(month_data, name=""cust"", by=month_year)`. This groups customers by their sign-up month.
    *   The `CALCULATE()` operation on the partitioned collection calculates:
        *   `month_year`: The month and year of sign-ups.
        *   `PMCS`: Per Month Customer Signups by counting all customers in each month.
        *   `total_amount`: The sum of all transaction amounts for customers who signed up in that month.

4.  **Filter Data**:
    *   The `WHERE()` operation filters the results to only include data from the past 6 months, excluding the current month.
        *   It checks if each customer's join date is within the date range (greater than or equal to 6 months ago, and less than the start of the current month).

5.  **Calculate PMAT**:
    *   Finally, the code calculates the Per Month Average Transaction amount (`PMAT`) by dividing `total_amount` by `PMCS` for each month.

This code follows PyDough conventions by using appropriate aggregation functions (`SUM` and `COUNT`), and proper filtering techniques. The final result is a collection that provides the month_year, PMCS (Per Month Customer Signups), and PMAT (Per Month Average Transaction amount) for each month in the past 6 months.",6.060215473175049,"# Define variables

The request asks for the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each ticker type over the past 7 days, including today. The output should include the ticker type and the corresponding ACP.

This requires:
1. Filtering DailyPrices to only include records from the past 7 days
2. Grouping these filtered prices by ticker type
3. Calculating the average closing price for each ticker type in this period
4. Returning the ticker type and its ACP

## PyDough Code

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta

end_date = date.today()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=6)

ticker_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE((date >= start_date) & (date <= end_date)).CALCULATE(
    ticker_type=ticker.ticker_type,
    close_price=close
)

result = ticker_prices.PARTITION(name=""ticker_types"", by=ticker_type).CALCULATE(
    ticker_type=ticker_type,
    average_closing_price=AVG(ticker_types.close_price)
)
```

## Explanation

1. **Date Range Calculation**:
   - `end_date = date.today()` gets today's date
   - `start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=6)` calculates the date 6 days prior to today, creating a 7-day inclusive window

2. **Filtering Daily Prices**:
   - `DailyPrices.WHERE((date >= start_date) & (date <= end_date))` filters the DailyPrices collection to only include records within the specified date range (past 7 days)

3. **Calculating Ticker Type and Closing Price**:
   - `.CALCULATE(ticker_type=ticker.ticker_type, close_price=close)` creates a new collection with just the ticker type and closing price fields

4. **Grouping and Calculating Average**:
   - `.PARTITION(name=""ticker_types"", by=ticker_type)` groups the filtered data by ticker type
   - `.CALCULATE(ticker_type=ticker_type, average_closing_price=AVG(ticker_types.close_price))` calculates the average closing price for each group (ticker type)

## Data Flow

The data flows through these steps:
1. Start with the DailyPrices collection
2. Filter to only include prices from the past 7 days
3. Extract ticker type and closing price
4. Group by ticker type
5. Calculate the average closing price for each ticker type
6. Return the ticker type and its average closing price

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Clear Variable Names**: Variables like `end_date`, `start_date`, and `ticker_prices` clearly indicate their purpose
2. **Step-by-Step Approach**: The code is broken down into logical steps, making it easier to understand
3. **Correct Use of Aggregation**: The code uses `AVG` to correctly calculate the average closing price for each ticker type
4. **Proper Partitioning**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group data by ticker type before calculating the average
5. **Proper Naming Convention**: The `name` parameter in `PARTITION` follows the convention of using the plural form of the grouping key (ticker_type -> ticker_types)
6. **Date Handling**: The code correctly uses datetime objects and timedelta for date calculations

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Filtering**: The code uses `WHERE` to filter data based on date criteria
2. **Calculation**: The code uses `CALCULATE` to derive new fields (ticker type and average closing price)
3. **Grouping**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group data before aggregation
4. **Aggregation**: The code uses `AVG` as an aggregation function
5. **Logical Operators**: The code uses `&` for logical AND operations
6. **Field Access**: The code uses dot notation to access fields (e.g., `ticker.ticker_type`)

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each ticker type over the past 7 days, inclusive of today. The code:

1. Filters the daily prices to only include those from the past 7 days (inclusive of today)
2. Groups these prices by ticker type
3. Calculates the average closing price for each ticker type
4. Returns the ticker type and its average closing price

Explanation:
1. We start by filtering customers who joined in 2022 using the `WHERE` clause and `YEAR(join_date) == 2022`.
2. We calculate the `is_active` field for each customer using the `IFF` function, which returns 1 if the customer has any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made)` returns True), and 0 otherwise.
3. We then use `PARTITION` to group these customers by their country.
4. In the partitioned collection, we calculate:
   - The `country` field (since that's what we want to return)
   - `total_customers` using `COUNT(countries)` - the total number of customers in each country
   - `active_customers` using `SUM(countries.is_active)` - the sum of all `is_active` values, which effectively counts the number of active customers (since `is_active` is 1 for active customers and 0 for inactive ones)
5. Finally, we calculate the `AR` (Activity Ratio) using the formula provided: `(active_customers / total_customers) * 100.0` and return the `country` and `AR` fields.

Explanation:
1. We calculate the start date for the past month using `datetime.today().replace(day=1) - relativedelta(months=1)`
2. We filter the `Transactions` collection to only include ""sell"" transactions from the past month
3. We partition the transactions by ticker symbol
4. For each ticker symbol, we calculate:
   - The ticker symbol itself
   - The total amount from sell transactions
   - The total tax paid
   - The total commission charged
   - The SPM (Selling Profit Margin) using the formula: `(Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`
5. We handle the case where the total amount from sells is 0 to avoid division by zero errors
6. Finally, we sort the results by SPM in descending order",3.772338628768921,"# Calculate the start date for the past month, inclusive of 1 month ago

Explanation:
1. **DailyPrices Collection**: The code starts with the `DailyPrices` collection and uses the `CALCULATE` function to create:
   - `month`: Formatted as YYYY-MM using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, and `MONTH`
   - `symbol`: Accessing the ticker symbol from the related `ticker` collection
   - Preserves `close`, `high`, and `low` prices

2. **First Partition**: The code partitions the data by `symbol` and `month` to group prices by each ticker symbol in each month

3. **Monthly Aggregations**: Within each group, it calculates:
   - `symbol` and `month` as grouping keys
   - `avg_close`: Average closing price for the month
   - `max_high`: Highest high price for the month
   - `min_low`: Lowest low price for the month

4. **Second Calculate with PREV**: The code uses `PREV` to get the previous month's data:
   - `prev_month`: The month before the current month for the same ticker
   - `prev_avg_close`: The average closing price for the previous month

5. **Final Calculation with MoMC**: The code:
   - Preserves `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`
   - Calculates MoMC as `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`, handling cases where there is no previous month (e.g., the first month of a ticker's data) by setting MoMC to `None`

The question asks to find the 3 distinct stocks with the highest price change between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023. This requires:

1. Joining the `DailyPrices` and `Tickers` tables
2. Filtering the data to include records between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023
3. For each distinct stock, calculating the difference between the highest high price and the lowest low price during this period
4. Selecting the top 3 stocks with the highest price change
5. Returning the ticker symbol and price change

## Step-by-step explanation of the solution

1. **Filter DailyPrices for the date range**: Filter the `DailyPrices` collection to only include records between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023.

2. **Group by ticker symbol**: Group the filtered DailyPrices by ticker symbol to calculate aggregate statistics for each stock.

3. **Calculate price change**: For each stock, calculate the difference between the maximum high price and the minimum low price.

4. **Sort and select top 3**: Sort the results by price change in descending order and select the top 3.

5. **Include ticker symbol**: Include the ticker symbol in the result.

## The PyDough code

```python
price_info = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    date >= DATETIME(""2023-04-01"")
).PARTITION(
    name=""tickers"", by=ticker_id

## Explanation of how the code works

1. **Filtering**: The code first filters the `DailyPrices` collection to only include records where the date is between April 1, 2023 (inclusive) and April 4, 2023 (inclusive). 

2. **Partitioning**: The filtered `DailyPrices` collection is then partitioned by `ticker_id` to group the records by stock.

3. **Calculation**: For each stock (group), the code calculates:
   - `symbol`: The ticker symbol from the `ticker` subcollection
   - `price_change`: The difference between the maximum high price and the minimum low price across all days in the date range

4. **Sorting and Selection**: The results are then sorted by `price_change` in descending order (highest price change first) and the top 3 records are selected.

5. **Result**: The final result contains the ticker symbol and price change for the top 3 stocks.

Explanation:
1. We first create two collections:

   - `transaction_months`: This collection extracts the month and year from each transaction's date_time

2. We then join these two collections on customer_id, signup_month=month, and signup_year=year. This creates a collection containing only the transactions that occurred in the same month as the customer's signup month.

3. Next, we partition this joined data by customer_id and count the number of transactions for each customer.

result = transaction_data.CALCULATE(
    transaction_type,
    distinct_customers,
    avg_shares
)
```

Explanation:
1. **Filtering Transactions:**
   The code starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions that occurred between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023 (inclusive). This is done using the `WHERE` clause with the condition:
   ```python
   (date_time >= DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""START OF DAY"")) &
   (date_time <= DATETIME(""2023-03-31"", ""START OF DAY""))
   ```
   The `DATETIME` function is used to ensure date comparisons are done correctly, truncating the dates to the start of each day for consistency.

2. **Partitioning by Transaction Type:**
   The filtered transactions are then partitioned by `transaction_type` using the `PARTITION` method. This groups transactions of the same type together under the name ""transaction_types"".

3. **Calculating Aggregations:**
   For each group of transactions, the code calculates:
   - `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
   - `distinct_customers`: The number of distinct customers who made this type of transaction using the `NDISTINCT` function.
   - `avg_shares`: The average number of shares traded in transactions of this type using the `AVG` function.

4. **Selecting Top 3 Transaction Types:**
   The results are sorted to keep only the top 3 transaction types based on the number of distinct customers using the `TOP_K` method with `distinct_customers.DESC()` as the sorting key.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   Finally, the code calculates the fields to be returned:
   - `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
   - `distinct_customers`: The number of distinct customers.
   - `avg_shares`: The average number of shares.

The overall flow follows PyDough best practices by:
- Filtering data first to reduce the volume before processing
- Using the appropriate aggregation functions for counting and averaging
- Using `TOP_K` for sorting and limiting results
- Creating intermediate variables for clarity

```

**Explanation:**

1. We start with the `Customers` collection, which contains all customer records.

2. We use the `WHERE` clause to filter customers based on whether they have made any transactions. The condition `HASNOT(transactions_made) == 1` checks if a customer has no associated transaction records (i.e., they have not made any transactions). The `HASNOT()` function returns 1 if the sub-collection is empty, so `HASNOT(transactions_made) == 1` ensures we're selecting customers with no transactions.

3. We use the `CALCULATE` clause to select only the customer ID (`_id`) and name (`name`) for the filtered customers. This ensures that only the requested fields are returned in the result.",2.327873706817627,"Customers.WHERE(HASNOT(transactions_made) == 1).CALCULATE(_id, name)","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=190 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=190)] prompt_token_count=17979 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=17979)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=18169 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

## Analysis of the Question

The question asks for a distinct list of customer IDs who have made a 'buy' transaction. This requires:

1. Accessing the `Transactions` collection.
2. Filtering for transactions where `transaction_type` is 'buy'.
3. Extracting the distinct `customer_id` values from these transactions.

## Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Start with the Transactions collection**: We begin with the `Transactions` collection as it contains the transaction information we need.

2. **Filter for 'buy' transactions**: We use the `WHERE` clause to filter the transactions where the `transaction_type` is equal to 'buy'.

3. **Calculate the customer_id**: We use the `CALCULATE` clause to extract the `customer_id` from the filtered transactions.

4. **Ensure distinct customer_ids**: We use `PARTITION` with the `by` parameter set to `customer_id` to ensure that we get a distinct list of customer IDs.

## The PyDough Code

```python
result = Transactions.WHERE(transaction_type == 'buy').CALCULATE(customer_id).PARTITION(

1. `Transactions.WHERE(transaction_type == 'buy')`: This part filters the `Transactions` collection to only include transactions where the `transaction_type` field equals 'buy'.

2. `.CALCULATE(customer_id)`: This extracts the `customer_id` field from the filtered transactions.

3. `.PARTITION(name=""customers"", by=customer_id)`: This groups the transactions by `customer_id`, creating a distinct list of customer IDs who have made a 'buy' transaction. The `name=""customers""` parameter assigns a name to the partitioned collection, although this name is not used in the final result since we are not calculating any aggregates.

The result variable will contain a collection with one column named `customer_id`, containing the distinct list of customer IDs who have made a 'buy' transaction.",4.149709463119507,"result = Transactions.WHERE(transaction_type == 'buy').CALCULATE(customer_id).PARTITION(

## Analysis of the Question

The question asks for the top 10 ticker symbols based on their total transaction amount. This requires aggregating transactions by ticker symbol and then selecting the top 10 based on the sum of their transaction amounts. We need to return the ticker symbol, the number of transactions, and the total transaction amount for these top 10 tickers.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Partition transactions by ticker symbol:** We'll use the `PARTITION` function to group transactions by their ticker symbol.
2. **Calculate aggregation metrics:** For each ticker symbol, we'll calculate the number of transactions (`COUNT`) and the total transaction amount (`SUM(amount)`).
3. **Select the top 10:** We'll use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 10 tickers based on their total transaction amount in descending order.
4. **Define the final result:** We'll use `CALCULATE` to define the fields to be returned in the final result: ticker symbol, number of transactions, and total transaction amount.

## The PyDough Code

```python
tickers_agg = Tickers.PARTITION(name=""tick"", by=symbol).CALCULATE(
    symbol=symbol,
    total_amount=SUM(transactions_of.amount),
    transaction_count=COUNT(transactions_of)
)

result = tickers_agg.TOP_K(10, by=total_amount.DESC()).CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol=symbol,
    transaction_count=transaction_count,
    total_transaction_amount=total_amount
)
```

## Explanation of PyDough Functions and Patterns

### 1. PARTITION
The `PARTITION` function is used to group records by specified keys [de0725f]. In this code, it groups transactions by their ticker symbol, creating a collection of ticker symbols where each record contains all transactions for that symbol.

### 2. CALCULATE
The `CALCULATE` function is used to derive new fields, rename existing ones, or select specific fields [8352c0e]. In this code, it's used twice:
- First, to calculate the total amount and transaction count for each ticker symbol
- Second, to define the final result structure with renamed fields

### 3. SUM
The `SUM` function is an aggregation function that sums values from a plural sub-collection [0a241da]. In this code, it sums the amounts of all transactions for each ticker symbol.

### 4. COUNT
The `COUNT` function is an aggregation function that counts the number of non-null records in a collection [0a241da]. In this code, it counts the number of transactions for each ticker symbol.

### 5. TOP_K
The `TOP_K` function selects the top K records based on a specified ordering [537e914]. In this code, it selects the top 10 ticker symbols based on their total transaction amount in descending order.

### 6. DESC
The `DESC` function specifies that an expression should be sorted in descending order [8352c0e]. In this code, it orders the tickers by their total transaction amount in descending order.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flow in this code follows these steps:

1. Start with the `Tickers` collection
2. Group transactions by ticker symbol using `PARTITION`
3. Calculate aggregation metrics for each ticker symbol (total amount and transaction count) using `CALCULATE`
4. Select the top 10 tickers based on total amount in descending order using `TOP_K`
5. Define the final result structure with renamed fields using `CALCULATE`

## How This Code Follows PyDough Best Practices

1. **Proper use of PARTITION**: The code correctly uses `PARTITION` to group transactions by ticker symbol [de0725f].
2. **Clear variable naming**: The variable names (`tickers_agg`, `result`) clearly indicate their purpose [8352c0e].
3. **Chained operations**: The code chains operations in a readable manner, first calculating aggregation metrics and then selecting the top K records [537e914].
4. **Renaming fields**: The code renames fields in the final result to match the request, which is considered good practice [8352c0e].
5. **Hierarchical thinking**: The code follows PyDough's hierarchical thinking model, grouping transactions under ticker symbols before performing calculations [988171e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers the original question by:

1. Identifying the top 10 ticker symbols by total transaction amount
2. Returning the ticker symbol itself
3. Providing the number of transactions for each ticker
4. Providing the total transaction amount for each ticker

The result is exactly what was requested: a list of the top 10 tickers with their symbol, number of transactions, and total transaction amount, ordered by total transaction amount in descending order.",7.938509702682495,"tickers_agg = Tickers.PARTITION(name=""tick"", by=symbol).CALCULATE(

Return the status and number of transactions.,"SELECT sbTxStatus, COUNT(*) AS num_transactions FROM sbTransaction GROUP BY sbTxStatus ORDER BY CASE WHEN num_transactions IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END DESC, num_transactions DESC LIMIT 3;",Broker,"## Analysis of the Question

The question asks for the top 3 transaction statuses based on the number of transactions for each status. We need to count the number of transactions for each unique transaction status and then sort these counts in descending order, selecting the top 3 statuses with their counts.

## Step-by-step Explanation of the Solution

1. Start with the `Transactions` collection
2. Group the transactions by `status`
3. Count the number of transactions in each group
4. Sort the results by the count in descending order
5. Select the top 3 results
6. Calculate the status and number of transactions for each status

## The PyDough Code

```python
transaction_status_counts = Transactions.PARTITION(
    name=""transaction_status"", by=status
).CALCULATE(
    status,
    transaction_count=COUNT(Transactions)
)

top_3_transaction_statuses = transaction_status_counts.TOP_K(
    3, by=transaction_count.DESC()
)

result = top_3_transaction_statuses.CALCULATE(
    status,
    transaction_count
)
```

## Explanation of How the Code Works

1. The code starts with the `Transactions` collection, which contains all transaction records.

2. It uses the `PARTITION` operation to group the transactions by their status. The `name=""transaction_status""` part specifies the name that will be used to refer to the subcollection within the partition. The `by=status` part indicates that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values in the `status` field.

3. For each group (unique status), it calculates:
   - The status itself (from the partition key)
   - The count of transactions with that status using `COUNT(Transactions)`

4. The `TOP_K(3, by=transaction_count.DESC())` operation selects the top 3 status groups with the highest transaction counts. The `DESC()` modifier specifies that the sorting should be done in descending order based on the `transaction_count` field.

5. Finally, the `.CALCULATE(status, transaction_count)` operation selects only the status and transaction count fields for the result.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Partitioning for Aggregation**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group transactions by status, which is the correct approach for performing aggregation operations on subsets of data.

2. **Descriptive Variable Names**: The variable names (`transaction_status_counts`, `top_3_transaction_statuses`) clearly indicate what data they contain.

3. **Clear Field Selection**: The code explicitly specifies which fields to include in the final result, avoiding unnecessary data being returned.

4. **Proper Use of TOP_K**: The code uses `TOP_K` with the `by=field.DESC()` pattern, which is the correct way to select the top N records based on a specific field.

5. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The solution is built by breaking down the problem into logical steps: first partitioning the data, then aggregating, then sorting, and finally selecting the desired output fields.

This approach follows PyDough conventions and efficiently answers the original question by leveraging the language's hierarchical model and aggregation capabilities.",5.856418609619141,"transaction_status_counts = Transactions.PARTITION(

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
   - `Transactions.PARTITION(name=""transactions"", by=(customer.state, ticker.ticker_type))`: This partitions the Transactions collection by customer state and ticker type, grouping transactions that have the same combination of customer state and ticker type.
   - `.CALCULATE(customer_state = customer.state, ticker_type = ticker.ticker_type, transaction_count = COUNT(transactions))`: For each group, it calculates:
     - The customer state
     - The ticker type
     - The count of transactions in that group
   - `.TOP_K(5, by=transaction_count.DESC())`: This selects the top 5 groups with the highest transaction counts.
   - `.CALCULATE(customer_state, ticker_type, transaction_count)`: This selects the final result with the required fields.

Code Context:
# Explanation of PyDough Code for Transaction Analysis

## Overview

The PyDough code provided answers the question: ""What are the top 5 combinations of customer state and ticker type by number of transactions? Return the customer state, ticker type, and number of transactions.""

Let me explain this code based on the PyDough documentation you provided.

## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### 1. PARTITION Operation

The code uses the `PARTITION` operation to group data based on specified criteria [7e88a8e]. This is a core PyDough operation that allows you to:
- Divide data into groups based on specific keys
- Calculate aggregates for each group
- Allow descendant contexts to access these calculated values

In this code, the `PARTITION` operation is used to group transactions by both customer state (`customer.state`) and ticker type (`ticker.ticker_type`).

### 2. CALCULATE Operation

The `CALCULATE` operation is used to derive new fields, rename existing fields, or select specific fields [4c3a9c1]. It's a versatile operation that can be used for:
- Selecting fields from a collection
- Creating new fields through calculations
- Renaming fields to make them more descriptive

In the code, `CALCULATE` is used twice:
- First to select fields from the partitioned data and create a count of transactions
- Second to select the specific fields to be returned in the final result

### 3. COUNT Function

`COUNT` is an aggregation function that counts non-null records [4c3a9c1]. In this code, it's used to count the number of transactions for each combination of customer state and ticker type.

### 4. TOP_K Operation

`TOP_K` is used to select the top K records based on specified criteria [4c3a9c1]. In this code, it's used to select the top 5 combinations with the highest transaction counts.

### 5. DESC Sorting Modifier

The `.DESC()` modifier is used to sort results in descending order [4c3a9c1]. In this code, it's applied to the `transaction_count` field to sort from highest to lowest count.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this data flow:

1. Starts with the `Transactions` collection, which contains transaction data
2. Groups these transactions by both customer state and ticker type using `PARTITION`
3. For each group:
   - Calculates the customer state
   - Calculates the ticker type
   - Counts the number of transactions in that group using `COUNT`
4. From the grouped results, selects the top 5 combinations based on transaction count in descending order
5. Creates a final result with just the three fields requested: customer state, ticker type, and transaction count

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Building operations incrementally**: The code builds the solution in two steps, first creating the transaction groups and then selecting the top 5 [8ad6367]. This makes the code easier to read and understand.

2. **Using appropriate aggregation functions**: The code correctly uses `COUNT` to count transactions within each group [4c3a9c1].

3. **Clear naming conventions**: The code uses descriptive names for variables and fields, making the logic clear (e.g., `transaction_groups`, `customer_state`, `transaction_count`).

4. **Avoiding complex expressions**: The code keeps expressions simple and readable, following PyDough's design philosophy [8ad6367].

5. **Proper use of PARTITION**: The code correctly uses `PARTITION` to group data before applying aggregation functions [7e88a8e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the top 5 combinations of customer state and ticker type by transaction count. The code directly addresses this by:

1. Grouping transactions by customer state and ticker type using `PARTITION`
2. Counting transactions for each combination using `COUNT`
3. Sorting these combinations by transaction count in descending order using `TOP_K` with `.DESC()`
4. Returning just the requested fields: customer state, ticker type, and transaction count

This approach is similar to the example shown in [4c3a9c1] of finding the top 5 regions with the highest total order value, but here we're using two grouping criteria (customer state and ticker type) instead of just one (region).

## PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using uppercase for PyDough operations (PARTITION, CALCULATE, TOP_K) [7e88a8e]
2. Using lowercase for variable names (result) [8ad6367]
3. Properly chaining operations together in a readable sequence
4. Following the required syntax for each operation (e.g., providing the `name` and `by` parameters to `PARTITION`)
5. Using the `.DESC()` modifier to sort in descending order, as shown in examples in [4c3a9c1]

## Example from Search Results

A similar example from the search results [4c3a9c1] shows finding regions with the highest total order value:

```python
Regions.CALCULATE(r_name, total_value=SUM(
    nations.customers.orders.total_price
)).TOP_K(5, by=total_value.DESC())
```

This example demonstrates the same pattern of:
1. Using `CALCULATE` to derive fields
2. Using `TOP_K` with `.DESC()` to get the top results
3. Proper use of aggregation functions (SUM in this case, COUNT in our example)

Our code follows this pattern but uses `PARTITION` to group by multiple criteria before applying the aggregation function.",13.318506002426147,"Regions.CALCULATE(r_name, total_value=SUM(
    nations.customers.orders.total_price

1. Start with the `customers` collection.
2. Group the customers by country using PARTITION.
3. Calculate the count of customers for each country.
4. Use TOP_K to select the top 5 countries based on the count of customers in descending order.
5. Return the country name and number of customers in the final result.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
result = PARTITION(customers, name=""customers_by_country"", by=country).CALCULATE(
    country_name=country,
    number_of_customers=COUNT(customers)
).TOP_K(5, by=number_of_customers.DESC())
```

Explanation of how this code works:

1. The code starts with the `customers` collection and uses the PARTITION operation to group the customers by their country. The name ""customers_by_country"" is assigned to the partitioned collection.

2. Within the CALCULATE operation, two fields are computed:
   - `country_name`: This field selects the country value from each partitioned group.
   - `number_of_customers`: This field counts the number of customers in each country using the COUNT aggregation function.

3. After the PARTITION and CALCULATE operations, the TOP_K operation is used to select the top 5 countries based on the number_of_customers in descending order (DESC).

4. The final result contains the country name and the number of customers for each of the top 5 countries.

1. Analysis of the question:
The question asks for the top 5 countries with the highest total transaction amount in the past 30 days. We need to:
- Filter transactions within the last 30 days
- Group transactions by country
- Calculate the total transaction amount and number of transactions for each country
- Find the top 5 countries based on total transaction amount
- Return the country name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount

2. Step-by-step explanation of the solution:
- Start with the Broker collection to access the Transactions subcollection
- Filter transactions within the last 30 days using the WHERE clause with the DATEDIFF function
- Partition the filtered transactions by customer's country
- Calculate the total transaction amount (SUM(Transactions.amount))
- Calculate the number of transactions (COUNT(Transactions))
- Order the results by total transaction amount in descending order using TOP_K(5, by=...)
- Select the country name and the calculated metrics

3. The PyDough code in a Python code block:
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

today = datetime.today()
past_30_days = today - timedelta(days=30)

countries_data = Broker.Transactions.WHERE(
    Transactions.date_time >= past_30_days

    country=customer.country,
    transaction_amount=amount

    total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions.transaction_amount)
)

result = country_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())
```

4. Explanation of how the code works:
- The code first calculates the date 30 days ago from the current date using datetime and timedelta
- It then filters transactions to include only those within the last 30 days and projects the customer's country and transaction amount
- The code partitions these transactions by country and calculates the count of transactions and sum of amounts for each country

**Explanation:**

1. Define `END_DATE`: Use `DATETIME('now', 'START OF DAY')` to get the current date with the time truncated to the start of the day (midnight).
2. Calculate `start_date`: Use `DATETIME(END_DATE, '-7 D')` to calculate the date 7 days before the end date.
3. Filter daily prices: Use `WHERE` to filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include only prices where:
   - The ticker symbol is ""VTI""
   - The date is within the range of start_date to END_DATE (inclusive)
4. Calculate the minimum close price: Use `CALCULATE` with the aggregation function `MIN(close)` to find the lowest closing price within the filtered set of daily prices.

number of transactions by users who joined in the past 70 days,"SELECT COUNT(t.sbTxCustId) AS transaction_count FROM sbTransaction AS t JOIN sbCustomer AS c ON t.sbTxCustId = c.sbCustId WHERE c.sbCustJoinDate >= date('now', '-70 days');",Broker,"## Analysis of the Query

The query asks for the number of transactions grouped by users who joined in the past 70 days. This requires:
1. Filtering users who joined in the past 70 days
2. Counting the transactions for each of these users

## PyDough Code

```python
# Filter users who joined in the past 70 days
recent_customers = Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, 'now') <= 70)

# Calculate the number of transactions for each user
result = recent_customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_id=Customers._id,
    transaction_count=COUNT(transactions_made)
)
```

## Explanation

1. **Filtering Users**: The first step filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the past 70 days using the `DATEDIFF` function. We compare the difference between their join date and the current date in days and keep only those with a difference of 70 days or less.

2. **Counting Transactions**: The second step uses the `CALCULATE` function to:
   - For each user, retrieve their customer ID from `Customers._id`
   - Count the number of transactions made by each user using `COUNT(transactions_made)` on the subcollection `transactions_made`

The result is a collection where each row represents a user who joined in the past 70 days, with two columns: their customer ID and the count of their transactions.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

This code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Breaking Down Complex Queries**: The query is broken down into two steps (filtering and counting), which makes the code more readable and maintainable [0e9992a].

2. **Using Appropriate Functions**: The code uses the appropriate functions for the operations needed:
   - `DATEDIFF` to calculate the time difference between two dates [0e9992a]
   - `WHERE` to filter the data [c3f36c9]
   - `CALCULATE` to derive new fields [0e9992a]
   - `COUNT` to aggregate the number of transactions [e3f78c4]

3. **Descriptive Variable Names**: The variables used (e.g., `recent_customers`, `result`) clearly describe what data they contain [0e9992a].

4. **Proper Data Access**: The code properly accesses the collection names (`Customers`, `transactions_made`) and fields (`join_date`, `_id`) as defined in the data model [c3f36c9].

5. **Using Subcollections**: The code correctly uses the subcollection `transactions_made` to count the transactions for each customer [e3f78c4].

6. **Context-Free Expressions**: The code uses context-free expressions correctly (creating a variable for the filtered customers) [988171e].

## How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using dot notation to access subcollections (e.g., `Customers.transactions_made`) [0e9992a].

2. Using uppercase for PyDough operators (`WHERE`, `CALCULATE`) [c3f36c9].

3. Using keyword arguments for parameters in functions (`per=""customers""`, `na_pos='last'`) [c3f36c9].

4. Properly using aggregation functions (COUNT) on plural subcollections [e3f78c4].

5. Properly using DATEDIFF with the correct date format [0e9992a].

6. Following the pattern of filtering data with `WHERE` and then deriving new fields with `CALCULATE` [c3f36c9].

7. Properly accessing collections and subcollections through their relationship paths [0e9992a].",6.789308786392212,"# Filter users who joined in the past 70 days

1. **Analysis of the question:**
   The question asks for the customer who made the most sell transactions on a specific date (2023-04-01). We need to count the number of sell transactions for each customer on this date and then find the customer with the highest count.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   a. Filter transactions to include only sell transactions on 2023-04-01.
   b. Group these transactions by customer.
   c. Calculate the number of transactions for each customer.
   d. Find the customer with the highest transaction count.
   e. Return the customer's _id, name, and the number of transactions.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block:**
   ```python
   sell_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(
       (transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time == ""2023-04-01"")
   )
   customer_transaction_counts = PARTITION(
       sell_transactions,
       name=""customer_txns"",
       by=customer_id
   ).CALCULATE(
       customer_id,
       transaction_count=COUNT(Transactions)
   )
   top_customer = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())
   result = Customers.WHERE(id == top_customer.customer_id).CALCULATE(
       customer_id=id,
       customer_name=name,
       transaction_count=top_customer.SINGULAR().transaction_count
   )
   ```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - `sell_transactions = Transactions.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time == ""2023-04-01""))`: This line filters the Transactions collection to include only transactions where the transaction type is ""sell"" and the date is ""2023-04-01"".
   - `customer_transaction_counts = PARTITION(sell_transactions, name=""customer_txns"", by=customer_id).CALCULATE(customer_id, transaction_count=COUNT(Transactions))`: This partitions the sell transactions by customer_id, and then calculates the count of transactions for each customer.
   - `top_customer = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())`: This selects the customer with the highest transaction count.
   - `result = Customers.WHERE(id == top_customer.customer_id).CALCULATE(customer_id=id, customer_name=name, transaction_count=top_customer.SINGULAR().transaction_count)`: This retrieves the customer information (id and name) from the Customers collection, matching the customer with the highest transaction count, and returns the desired fields. The `.SINGULAR()` operation is used because TOP_K always returns a collection, even if it contains only one element, which in this case represents the top customer. Since we need to extract a single value from this collection, we use `.SINGULAR()` to convert it into a single record.

5. **Key PyDough functions and patterns used:**
   - **WHERE**: Used to filter collections based on conditions.
   - **PARTITION**: Used to group records by one or more fields.
   - **CALCULATE**: Used to create new fields or select specific fields from a collection.
   - **COUNT**: Used to count the number of records in a collection.
   - **TOP_K**: Used to select the top K records based on a sorting criterion.
   - **DESC**: Used to sort in descending order.
   - **SINGULAR**: Used to convert a collection with exactly one record into a single record.

6. **Important PyDough best practices demonstrated:**
   - Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
   - Using appropriate functions for filtering, grouping, and counting.
   - Using PARTITION and CALCULATE to create intermediate collections for clarity.
   - Using TOP_K to select the desired number of records with proper sorting.
   - Using SINGULAR when expecting a single result from a collection.

7. **How this code follows PyDough conventions:**
   - Follows the pattern of filtering, grouping, and calculating aggregations.
   - Uses the correct syntax for PARTITION, CALCULATE, and TOP_K operations.
   - Uses proper naming conventions for variables (e.g., `sell_transactions`, `customer_transaction_counts`).
   - Uses the appropriate sorting order (DESC for descending order).

8. **How the code addresses the original question:**
   The code directly addresses the original question by:
   - Identifying sell transactions on the specified date
   - Counting these transactions per customer
   - Finding the customer with the highest count
   - Returning the customer's id, name, and the number of transactions, as requested",7.753469705581665,"sell_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(

6. **Group by week**: Group the results by week (expressed as the start date of the week)
7. **Order results**: Order the results by week in ascending order

Now, I'll write the PyDough code to implement these steps:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

current_date = datetime.now().date()
sales = Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)
weeks = [(current_date - timedelta(days=7 * i)) for i in range(1, 9)]  # Get start dates of last 8 weeks

Explanation of the code:

1. **Calculate week boundaries**:
   - Gets the current date.
   - Creates a list `weeks` containing the start dates of the last 8 weeks, excluding the current week.

2. **Filter sales**:
   - Selects sales with `sale_price > 30000`.

3. **Filter payments**:
   - Filters payments received for the selected sales that fall within the last 8 weeks.

4. **Group by week**:
   - Groups the filtered payments by the week they were received in.
   - Creates a name for the grouped data called ""payments"".

5. **Calculate metrics**:
   - For each week:
     - Calculates `week_start_date` by getting the date of the start of the week.
     - Counts the total number of payments received (`total_payments`).
     - Counts the number of payments received on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) (`weekend_payments`).

6. **Order results**:
   - Orders the results by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1. **Import necessary libraries**: The code imports `datetime` and `timedelta` from the `datetime` module.
2. **Calculate the cutoff date**: It calculates the date 30 days ago from the current date using `date.today() - timedelta(days=30)`.
3. **Filter salespersons and count sales**: It navigates to the `Salespersons` collection, calculates the number of sales made by each salesperson in the past 30 days using `COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= thirty_days_ago))`, and selects the desired columns (`salesperson_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `num_sales`). The result is stored in the `salespersons_sales` variable.
4. **Order and select final columns**: It orders the salespersons by the number of sales made in descending order using `.ORDER_BY(num_sales.DESC())` and selects the same columns again in the final result.
5. **Assign result**: The final result is assigned to the `result` variable.

   We use `Cars.WHERE()` with `LIKE()` to filter cars that have 'M5' in their VIN number (case-insensitive comparison).
   ```python
   cars_with_m5 = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(vin_number.UPPER(), '%M5%'))
   ```

2. **Partition cars by model:**
   We use `PARTITION()` to group the filtered cars by their model.
   ```python
   car_models = cars_with_m5.PARTITION(name='models', by=model)
   ```

3. **Calculate sales count and other fields:**
   For each model, we calculate the number of sales and select the make, model.
   ```python
   result = car_models.CALCULATE(
       make=make,
       model=model,
       num_sales=COUNT(models.sale_records)
   )
   ```

### The PyDough code

```python
cars_with_m5 = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(vin_number.UPPER(), '%M5%'))
car_models = cars_with_m5.PARTITION(name='models', by=model)
result = car_models.CALCULATE(
    make=make,
    model=model,
    num_sales=COUNT(models.sale_records)
)
```

### Explanation of how the code works

1. `cars_with_m5 = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(vin_number.UPPER(), '%M5%'))`: This line filters the `Cars` collection to select only those cars whose VIN number contains 'M5' (case-insensitively). The `.UPPER()` method converts the VIN number to uppercase before comparison, and `%` is used as a wildcard character in the `LIKE()` function to allow partial matches.

2. `car_models = cars_with_m5.PARTITION(name='models', by=model)`: This line partitions the filtered cars by their model. The `PARTITION` function groups the cars by the 'model' field, and the `name='models'` parameter specifies that the group name will be 'models' when accessing the partitioned collection.

3. `result = car_models.CALCULATE(
    make=make,
    model=model,
    num_sales=COUNT(models.sale_records)
)`: This line calculates the number of sales for each model in the partitioned collection. 
   - `make=make`: This selects the make of each car model.
   - `model=model`: This selects the model name.
   - `num_sales=COUNT(models.sale_records)`: This counts the number of sale records associated with each model. Since the `models` collection is a partitioned collection, we can use it to access the sales records for each model.

The final result is a collection containing the make, model, and number of sales for each car model that has 'M5' in its VIN number.

This code follows the pattern demonstrated in Example #2 from the documentation, where cars are filtered based on a LIKE condition, and then their models are grouped to count sales:

```python
Good Example #2: For every city/state, count how many people live in that city/state.
Addresses.PARTITION(name=""cities"", by=(city, state)).CALCULATE(
    state,
    city,
    n_people=COUNT(Addresses.current_occupants)
)
```

The approach also follows the pattern from Example #10, where collections are filtered, then partitioned, and then counts are performed:

```python
# Good Example #10: For each state, finds the largest number of packages shipped
# to a single city in that state.
pack_info = Addresses.CALCULATE(city, state).packages_shipped_to
city_groups = pack_info.PARTITION(
    name=""cities"", by=(city, state)
).CALCULATE(n_packages=COUNT(packages_shipped_to))
city_groups.PARTITION(
    name=""states"", by=state
).CALCULATE(state, max_packs=MAX(cities.n_packages))
```",7.234632253646851,"# Good Example #10: For each state, finds the largest number of packages shipped
# to a single city in that state.

How many Toyota cars were sold in the last 30 days inclusive of today? Return the number of sales and total revenue.,"SELECT COUNT(s._id) AS num_sales, SUM(s.sale_price) AS total_revenue FROM sales AS s JOIN cars AS c ON s.car_id = c._id WHERE c.make = 'Toyota' AND s.sale_date BETWEEN DATE('now', '-30 days') AND DATE('now');",Dealership,"Answer:
1. **Analyze the question:**
   The question asks for two metrics related to Toyota cars sold in the last 30 days:
   - The number of sales
   - The total revenue generated from those sales

2. **Identify relevant collections and fields:**
   - `Sales` collection contains information about sales transactions
   - `Cars` subcollection (accessible through `Sales.car`) contains car information
   - `sale_price` field in the `Sales` collection represents the price of each sale
   - `sale_date` field in the `Sales` collection indicates when the sale occurred
   - The `make` field in the `Cars` collection contains the car brand

3. **Plan the query:**
   a. Calculate the cutoff date (30 days ago from today)
   b. Filter sales to only include those within the last 30 days and for Toyota cars
   c. Count the number of sales
   d. Calculate the total revenue by summing the sale prices
   e. Return both the count and the total revenue in a single result

4. **Write the PyDough code:**
   ```python
   import datetime

   today = datetime.date.today()
   cutoff_date = today - datetime.timedelta(days=30)

   result = Sales.WHERE(
       (car.make == ""Toyota"") & (sale_date >= cutoff_date)
   ).CALCULATE(
       number_of_sales=COUNT(car),
       total_revenue=SUM(sale_price)
   )
   ```

5. **Explain how the code works:**
   - The code first imports the `datetime` library and calculates the current date (`today`) and the cutoff date (30 days prior to today).
   - It then filters the `Sales` collection using `WHERE` to only include sales where the car's make is ""Toyota"" and the sale date is on or after the cutoff date.
   - The `CALCULATE` function is used to derive two new fields:
     - `number_of_sales`: Counts the number of records in the filtered collection, representing the number of sales.
     - `total_revenue`: Sums the `sale_price` values across all records in the filtered collection, representing the total revenue.

6. **Address any special patterns or PyDough best practices demonstrated:**
   - Using a calculated variable (`cutoff_date`) to simplify the date comparison
   - Combining multiple filter conditions with `&` (AND operator)
   - Using aggregation functions (`COUNT` and `SUM`) to calculate metrics
   - Accessing a subcollection (`car`) through a related collection (`Sales`)

7. **Show how the code follows PyDough conventions:**
   - Starts with a collection (`Sales`)
   - Uses `.WHERE()` to filter records based on conditions
   - Uses `.CALCULATE()` to derive new fields
   - Uses aggregation functions to reduce plural values to singular values
   - Follows the dot notation for accessing related collections (`Sales.car`)
   - Uses the appropriate operators (`==`, `>=`) for comparisons
   - Stores the result in a variable (`result`) for easy access

This code efficiently answers the question by filtering sales to only include Toyota cars sold in the last 30 days, then calculating the number of sales and the total revenue from those sales.",5.662475824356079,"import datetime

**Requirements Analysis**

1. Identify cars that have been sold
2. Determine which of these cars are no longer in inventory based on the most recent inventory snapshot
3. Group these cars by make and model
4. Find the highest sale price for each make and model
5. Order the results by sale price from highest to lowest

**Data Flow and Transformations**

1. Start with the `Cars` collection
2. Calculate the latest inventory status for each car
3. Filter cars that have been sold (have sale records)
4. Filter out cars that are currently in inventory
5. Group the remaining cars by make and model
6. Calculate the maximum sale price for each group
7. Order the results by sale price in descending order

**PyDough Code**

```python
car_inventory_status = Cars.CALCULATE(
    _id,
    make,
    model,
    latest_snapshot_date=MAX(inventory_snapshots.snapshot_date)

    model,
    max_sale_price=MAX(sales_made.sale_price)
)

result = grouped_cars.ORDER_BY(max_sale_price.DESC())
```

**Code Explanation**

1. **car_inventory_status**: This step calculates the latest snapshot date for each car by finding the maximum snapshot_date among all inventory_snapshots associated with that car.

2. **recent_snapshots**: This step retrieves the latest snapshot record for each car. The `.SINGULAR()` ensures that only one snapshot record is selected for each car.

3. **sold_cars**: This step filters for cars that have been sold (have sale_records). The `HAS(sale_records) == 1` checks if there is at least one sale record associated with the car.

4. **out_of_stock_cars**: This step filters for cars that are no longer in inventory. It checks if the `latest_snapshot.is_in_inventory` is 0, indicating that the car is out of stock.

5. **grouped_cars**: This step groups the filtered cars by make and model. For each group, it calculates the maximum sale_price from all associated sales_made records.

6. **result**: This step orders the results by max_sale_price in descending order, showing the highest sale prices first.

**PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated**

1. **Breaking down complex operations**: The code breaks down the problem into smaller, logical steps, making it easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Using meaningful variable names**: Variables like `car_inventory_status`, `recent_snapshots`, and `out_of_stock_cars` clearly indicate what each step does.
3. **Using SINGULAR()**: The `.SINGULAR()` method is used appropriately to ensure that only one latest snapshot record is selected for each car.
4. **Using PARTITION**: The PARTITION operation is used correctly to group cars by make and model.
5. **Using aggregation functions**: The MAX() function is used appropriately to find the highest sale price for each group.
6. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations in a logical sequence, making the data flow clear.
7. **Descriptive naming for derived fields**: The derived fields like `latest_snapshot_date` and `max_sale_price` have descriptive names that clearly indicate what they represent.

**How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions**

1. **Collection access**: The code starts with the appropriate collection (`Cars`) and uses dot notation to access subcollections and fields.
2. **Filtering with WHERE**: The code uses the WHERE function with appropriate conditions to filter data.
3. **Transformations with CALCULATE**: The CALCULATE function is used to derive new fields and select the ones needed in the output.
4. **Grouping with PARTITION**: The PARTITION function is used to group records by specified keys.
5. **Ordering with ORDER_BY**: The ORDER_BY function is used with appropriate sorting criteria.
6. **Aggregation functions**: The code uses aggregation functions like MAX() and COUNT() appropriately.
7. **Conditional logic**: The code uses conditional logic with HAS() and comparison operators to filter data.
8. **SINGULAR()**: The SINGULAR() method is used to handle one-to-many relationships correctly.

4. **Explanation of Key Functions and Patterns**
   - `Salespersons.WHERE(YEAR(hire_date) >= 2022)`: This filters salespersons hired in or after 2022.
   - `&`: Logical AND operator to combine multiple conditions.
   - `YEAR(date)`: Extracts the year from a date field.
   - `sales_made.CALCULATE(month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(...))`: Navigates to sales records and calculates a month-year string.
   - `LPAD(MONTH(sale_date), 2, ""0"")`: Pads the month with a leading zero if needed.
   - `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ...)`: Combines year and month with a hyphen separator.
   - `PARTITION(..., by=month_year)`: Groups sales records by the truncated month-year date.
   - `COUNT(sales_per_month)`: Counts the number of sales per month.
   - `SUM(sales_per_month.sale_price)`: Sums the sales revenue per month.
   - `NOT(...)`: Logical NOT operator.
   - `TOP_K(6, by=month_year.ASC())`: Takes the first 6 records sorted by month-year ascending.

5. **How the Code Addresses the Original Question**
   - Filters salespersons to only those hired between 2022 and 2023
   - Groups sales data by month
   - Calculates the required metrics (PMSPS and PMSR)
   - Orders the results by month in ascending order
   - Filters out the current month
   - Returns all months in the results, including those with 0 values
   - Limits the results to the last 6 months

6. **Important Notes**
   - The code assumes that the `sale_date` field contains full dates. If it contains timestamps, additional formatting might be needed.
   - The code uses the current month to filter results. It excludes the current month but includes all months before that, up to 6 months in the past.",7.143573760986328,"from datetime import datetime

q1_2023_sales = Sales.WHERE(
    YEAR(sale_date) == 2023 & MONTH(sale_date) >= 1 & MONTH(sale_date) <= 3
)

average_price = q1_2023_sales.CALCULATE(
    average_sale_price=AVG(sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation of How the Code Works**

1. **Filter Sales Data**: 
   - `Sales.WHERE(...)`: This starts with the Sales collection and applies a filter.
   - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023 & MONTH(sale_date) >= 1 & MONTH(sale_date) <= 3`: This condition filters sales to include only those made in the year 2023 and months January (1), February (2), and March (3), which corresponds to the first quarter of 2023.

2. **Calculate Average Sale Price**:
   - `.CALCULATE(average_sale_price=AVG(sale_price))`: This calculates the average of the sale_price field for all sales that passed the filter. The result is stored in a field named `average_sale_price`.

The final result will be a collection containing a single row with a field named `average_sale_price` that holds the average sale price for the first quarter of 2023.",3.8943543434143066,"q1_2023_sales = Sales.WHERE(

The question asks to calculate the average time difference between a sale date and its corresponding payment received date. We need to:

1. Access the `Sales` collection.
2. For each sale, access the corresponding `PaymentsReceived` collection.
3. Calculate the difference in days between `sale_date` from `Sales` and `payment_date` from `PaymentsReceived` using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Calculate the average of these differences.
5. Round the result to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

# PyDough Code

```python
result = Sales.CALCULATE(days_between=ABS(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, payment.payment_date)))
avg_days = TPCH.CALCULATE(avg_days=ROUND(AVG(result.days_between), 2))
```

# Explanation

1. **Accessing Sales and PaymentsReceived**: The code starts by accessing the `Sales` collection. Each record in this collection represents a sale transaction.
2. **Calculating the Difference in Days**:
   - `Sales.CALCULATE(days_between=ABS(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, payment.payment_date)))` creates a new calculated field `days_between` for each sale.
   - `ABS` ensures the result is always positive, handling cases where payment may occur before the sale is recorded.
   - `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, payment.payment_date)` calculates the difference in days between the sale date and the payment date. Since each sale can have multiple payments, this results in a plural value.
3. **Calculating the Average**:
   - The second line `TPCH.CALCULATE(avg_days=ROUND(AVG(result.days_between), 2))` calculates the average of all `days_between` values.
   - `TPCH.CALCULATE` is used to create a singular result from the entire dataset.
   - `AVG(result.days_between)` calculates the average difference in days across all sales.
4. **Rounding the Result**:
   - `ROUND(AVG(result.days_between), 2)` rounds the average to 2 decimal places as required by the question.

# Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through two main transformations:

1. First, the code transforms each sale transaction into a calculation of days between sale and payment dates. Since there might be multiple payments for each sale, it becomes a plural value.

2. Then, it transforms these individual differences into a single average value across all sales in the database.

# PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Appropriate Use of Built-in Functions**: The code uses the built-in `DATEDIFF`, `AVG`, and `ROUND` functions appropriately to perform the required calculations.

2. **Clarity and Readability**: The code is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand what operations are being performed.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: The code separates the calculation of the time differences from the aggregation and rounding, improving readability and maintainability.

4. **Use of ABS for Positivity**: The code uses ABS to ensure a positive result, which handles cases where payment may occur before the sale is recorded, demonstrating defensive programming.

5. **Correct Use of Aggregation**: The code correctly uses the AVG function to calculate the average across all records, transforming a plural collection into a singular value.

# How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Correct Syntax**: The code follows the correct PyDough syntax, using uppercase for built-in functions (AVG, ROUND, DATEDIFF) and lowercase for collection names.

2. **Logical Flow**: The code follows a logical flow, first performing the per-record calculation (days_between) and then performing the aggregation (average).

3. **Proper Variable Naming**: The code uses descriptive variable names that clearly indicate what the variables represent.

4. **Correct Collection Reference**: The code correctly references the collections and fields as defined in the documentation and the provided database structure.

5. **Uses `TPCH.CALCULATE`**: For the final result aggregation, the code correctly uses `TPCH.CALCULATE` to obtain a singular result for the entire database.",7.160191297531128,"result = Sales.CALCULATE(days_between=ABS(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, payment.payment_date)))

# Explanation

The code calculates the gross profit margin (GPM) for car sales in 2023 by following these steps:

1. **Calculate Profit for Each Sale**: The code first calculates the gross profit for each individual sale. It accesses the `Sales` sub-collection of the `Dealership` and creates a new field `profit` for each sale record by subtracting the `car.cost` from the `sale_price`.

2. **Calculate Total Revenue for 2023**: Next, it calculates the total revenue from all sales made in the year 2023. It filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023 and then sums up all the `sale_price` values.

3. **Calculate Total Cost for 2023**: Similarly, it calculates the total cost of cars sold in 2023. It filters the `Sales` collection to include only records from 2023 and sums up the `car.cost` values for each sale.

4. **Calculate Gross Profit Margin**: Finally, it calculates the GPM for 2023 using the standard formula: `((total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023) * 100`. The result is stored in the `gpm_2023` field of the `Dealership` collection.

The code efficiently uses PyDough's aggregation capabilities to perform these calculations in a concise and readable manner.",4.791029453277588,"# Calculate the gross profit for each sale by subtracting the car's cost from its sale price

```python
# First, find the car that was sold on the same day it went out of inventory

# Finally, calculate the make, model, and sale price of that car
result = highest_price_car.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)
```

Explanation:
1. First, we find all Sales where the sale date is the same as the snapshot date of the car when it went out of inventory (is_in_inventory == False).
2. Then, we use TOP_K to find the car with the highest sale price among those that meet the condition.
3. Finally, we calculate the make, model, and sale price of that car in the result.

From the PyDough Reference File, we know that TOP_K selects the top k records based on the specified sorting criteria. We also know that CALCULATE is used to select specific fields and rename them if needed.

According to the documentation:
```
""If the 'per' string has a suffix ':idx' where idx is an integer, it
specifies which ancestor with that name to use (1=most recent,
2=2nd most recent, etc.)""
```

This applies to the RANKING function, which is similar to the sorting we use with TOP_K.

The approach taken is similar to Example #2 from the documentation:
```
# For every customer, finds their most recent order

1. Calculates the date 7 days ago from today
2. Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales with dates within the last 7 days
3. Counts the number of sales in that period

Here's the code:

```python
import datetime
today = datetime.date.today()
seven_days_ago = today - datetime.timedelta(days=7)
sales_within_7_days = Sales.WHERE((sale_date >= seven_days_ago) & (sale_date <= today))

This code first calculates the dates needed, then filters the Sales collection to the past week, and finally counts those sales to get the Total Sales Count.

The code follows PyDough best practices by:
1. Using a descriptive variable name (`sales_within_7_days`)
2. Applying a WHERE clause before calculating results
3. Using the appropriate aggregation function (`COUNT`)
4. Assigning the result to a variable (`tsc`)

The user wants to find cars that have no sales records, displaying their ID, make, model, and year. This requires checking for the absence of related records in the `sales_records` subcollection of `Cars`.

# Step-by-step Explanation

1. Start with the `Cars` collection.
2. Use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields: `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`.
3. Use `WHERE` with `HASNOT` to filter cars that have no records in the `sale_records` subcollection.
4. Assign the result to a variable named `no_sales_cars`.

# The PyDough Code

```python
no_sales_cars = Cars.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year).WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records))
```

# Explanation of How the Code Works

1. `Cars.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`: This part of the query starts with the `Cars` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields (`_id` as `car_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`).

2. `.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records))`: This part of the query filters the results to only include cars where the `sale_records` subcollection is empty. The `HASNOT` function returns True if the subcollection is empty (no sales records exist for that car).

3. `no_sales_cars`: The final result is assigned to the variable `no_sales_cars`, which contains cars with no sales records and their car ID, make, model, and year.

# PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Using CALCULATE for field selection**: The query uses `CALCULATE` to explicitly select and rename fields, making the intent clear.

2. **Using HASNOT for existence checks**: The query correctly uses `HASNOT` to check for the absence of related records in a subcollection.

3. **Clear variable naming**: The variable `no_sales_cars` clearly indicates the purpose of the result.

4. **Chaining operations**: The query chains operations (CALCULATE followed by WHERE), which is a common pattern in PyDough.

5. **Proper field renaming**: The query renames `_id` to `car_id` to improve readability and conform to the user's request.

# How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. The query starts with a collection (`Cars`).
2. It uses the correct syntax for `CALCULATE` to select and rename fields.
3. It uses `WHERE` with a Boolean condition to filter records.
4. It uses `HASNOT` to check for the absence of related records.
5. The result is assigned to a descriptive variable name.

The question asks to retrieve a distinct list of salesperson IDs who have received a cash payment. This involves joining three tables: `salespersons`, `sales`, and `payments_received`. We need to filter payments where the payment method is cash and then retrieve the distinct salesperson IDs from those sales.

# Step-by-step explanation of the solution

1. Start with the `payments_received` collection
2. Filter for cash payments using `WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`
3. Join with the `sales` collection via `sale_record` relationship
4. Calculate the salesperson ID from the related `sales` record
5. Use PARTITION to group the results by salesperson ID to get distinct values
6. Use CALCULATE to select the salesperson ID

# The PyDough code in a Python code block

```python
result = PaymentsReceived.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"").CALCULATE(
    salesperson_id = sale_record.salesperson_id
).PARTITION(name=""distinct_salespersons"", by=salesperson_id).CALCULATE(
    salesperson_id = salesperson_id
)
```

# Explanation of how the code works

1. `PaymentsReceived.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`: This starts with the `PaymentsReceived` collection and filters it to include only payments where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".

2. `.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = sale_record.salesperson_id)`: This calculates a new field `salesperson_id` by accessing the `sale_record` (which is a reference to the `sales` table) and then getting the `salesperson_id` from that related record.

3. `.PARTITION(name=""distinct_salespersons"", by=salesperson_id)`: This groups the filtered results by `salesperson_id`, ensuring we get distinct salesperson IDs.

4. `.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = salesperson_id)`: This final step selects the `salesperson_id` field from the partitioned data. Since the data is partitioned by `salesperson_id`, each record in the result will have a unique salesperson ID.

I'll explain the PyDough code that answers the question ""Return the top 5 salespersons by number of sales in the past 30 days? Return their first and last name, total sales count and total revenue amount.""

### Code Analysis

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

today = datetime.today()
last_30_days = today - timedelta(days=30)

top_salespersons = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    first_name=first_name,
    last_name=last_name,
    sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= last_30_days)),
    total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= last_30_days).sale_price)
).TOP_K(5, by=sales_count.DESC())
```

### PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

1. **Date Manipulation**: The code uses Python's `datetime` and `timedelta` classes to calculate dates. This is consistent with PyDough's approach to date handling in examples like:
   ```python
   Orders.WHERE(order_date < DATETIME(""1995-01-01""))  # Filter orders before 1995-01-01
   ```

2. **COUNT Aggregation Function**: The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of sales made by each salesperson in the past 30 days. This aligns with PyDough's documentation:
   ```python
   n_packages=COUNT(Packages)  # Count number of packages
   ```

3. **SUM Aggregation Function**: The `SUM` function is used to calculate the total revenue generated by each salesperson in the past 30 days. This follows examples like:
   ```python
   Total_revenue=SUM(customers.orders.total_price)  # Sum all orders' prices
   ```

4. **WHERE Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause is used to filter sales within the last 30 days, which is a standard filtering pattern in PyDough:
   ```python
   Packages.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 2023)  # Filter packages ordered in 2023
   ```

5. **TOP_K**: The `TOP_K` function is used to select the top 5 salespersons based on their sales count. This follows PyDough's sorting mechanism:
   ```python
   customers.TOP_K(10, by=COUNT(orders).DESC())  # Top 10 customers by order count
   ```

6. **CALCULATE**: The `CALCULATE` function is used to define the fields to be included in the result set. This is a core PyDough operation for transforming collections:
   ```python
   People.CALCULATE(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)  # Select first and last names
   ```

### Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this data flow:

1. Calculates the current date and a date 30 days ago
2. Starts with the `Salespersons` collection
3. Uses `CALCULATE` to:
   - Select the salesperson's first name
   - Select the salesperson's last name
   - Count the sales made by the salesperson within the last 30 days
   - Sum the sale prices for sales made by the salesperson within the last 30 days
4. Uses `TOP_K` to select the top 5 salespersons based on their sales count in descending order

### PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Using Date Variables**: The code creates `today` and `last_30_days` variables to make the code more readable and maintainable, following the pattern shown in:
   ```python
   today = datetime.today()
   month_ago = today - timedelta(days=30)
   ```

2. **Clear Field Naming**: The code uses descriptive field names like `first_name`, `last_name`, `sales_count`, and `total_revenue` which make the query logic clear.

3. **Filtering Within Aggregations**: The code demonstrates the proper way to filter before aggregating, as shown in:
   ```python
   sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= last_30_days).sale_price
   ```

4. **Top-Down Approach**: The code follows a top-down approach by starting with the collection (`Salespersons`) and then navigating to related sub-collections (`sales_made`), which is a best practice in PyDough.

### How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Collection → Operation Pattern**: The code follows the standard PyDough pattern of starting with a collection (`Salespersons`) and then applying operations to it (`CALCULATE`, `WHERE`, `TOP_K`).

2. **Named Parameters**: The code uses named parameters in functions like `CALCULATE` and `TOP_K`, which is the convention in PyDough.

3. **Method Chaining**: The code chains operations together in a readable sequence (`CALCULATE().TOP_K()`).

4. **Descending Order**: The code uses `.DESC()` in `TOP_K(by=sales_count.DESC())` to sort in descending order, which is the standard PyDough way to specify sorting direction.

5. **Data Transformation**: The code transforms the data by filtering sales to the last 30 days, aggregating sales by salesperson, and then selecting the top 5 based on sales count.

### How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the top 5 salespersons by number of sales in the past 30 days, with their first and last names, total sales count, and total revenue amount.

The code directly addresses this by:
1. Calculating the date range (last 30 days)
2. Calculating each salesperson's:
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Count of sales in the past 30 days
   - Total revenue from sales in the past 30 days
3. Selecting the top 5 salespersons based on sales count

The result contains exactly the requested information: first name, last name, total sales count, and total revenue amount for the top 5 salespersons.",9.704318523406982,sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= last_30_days).sale_price,"cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1363 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=1363)] prompt_token_count=18521 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=18521)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=19884 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

result = state_revenue.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partitioning:** The code starts by partitioning the `Addresses` collection by state, creating groups of addresses for each unique state value.

2. **Calculating Revenue and Customer Count:** For each state group, it calculates:
   - `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` from the `Packages` collection (representing sales made to customers in that state).
   - `num_unique_customers`: The count of distinct `customer_id` in the `Packages` collection, indicating the number of unique customers who have purchased from that state.

3. **Sorting and Limiting:** Finally, it uses `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` to select the top 5 states with the highest total revenue.

The result is a collection with 5 records, each representing a state and containing the state name, total revenue, and number of unique customers for that state, sorted in descending order of total revenue.",3.023815393447876,"state_revenue = Addresses.PARTITION(name=""states"", by=state).CALCULATE(

1. Analyze the question:
The question asks for the top 3 payment methods based on the total payment amount received. We need to calculate the total payment amount for each payment method and then sort them to get the top 3.
The required output should include:
- Payment method
- Total number of payments
- Total amount

2. Identify the relevant data:
The relevant collection is `PaymentsReceived`, which contains payment information, including the payment method and payment amount.

3. Define the solution logic:
a. Group the `PaymentsReceived` collection by `payment_method`.
b. For each payment method, calculate the total number of payments and the total amount.
c. Sort the result by total amount in descending order.
d. Select the top 3 records.
e. Format the output to include the payment method, total number of payments, and total amount.

4. Write the PyDough code:

    total_payments=COUNT(methods),
    total_amount=SUM(methods.payment_amount)
).TOP_K(3, by=total_amount.DESC())
```

5. Explain how the code works:
a. The code starts with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
b. It uses `PARTITION` to group the collection by `payment_method`, creating a sub-collection named ""methods"".
c. For each payment method group, it uses `CALCULATE` to:

   - Count the number of payments in that group
   - Calculate the sum of all payment amounts in that group

Code Context:
This PyDough code solves the user's question by first partitioning the `Customers` collection by state, then calculating the total signups for each state, and finally selecting the top 2 states with the highest number of signups.

PyDough-specific Functions and Patterns:
- `PARTITION`: Groups data by specified key(s)
- `TOP_K`: Selects the top k records based on specified criteria
- `CALCULATE`: Defines new fields and performs aggregations
- `COUNT`: Counts the number of records in a collection
- `DESC()`: Specifies descending order for sorting

Data Flow and Transformations:
1. Starts with the `Customers` collection
2. Partitions customers by state to group them together
3. For each state, calculates the state name and counts the number of customers (signups) in that state
4. Selects the top 2 states based on signup count in descending order
5. Returns the state name and signup count for those top states

PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated:
- Using PARTITION to group data before aggregation
- Using CALCULATE to define new fields with descriptive names
- Using TOP_K with DESC() for sorting and selection
- Building the solution step by step with intermediate variables

**Explanation**

1. **Calculate the date 3 months ago**: 
   The code uses the `DATETIME` function to calculate the date three months ago from the current date. This date is stored in the `three_months_ago` variable.

2. **Filter sales**:
   The code filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales that occurred within the last three months, using the `sale_date >= three_months_ago` condition.

3. **Calculate total sales and revenue for each salesperson**:
   The code starts with the `Salespersons` collection. It calculates the following information for each salesperson:
     - `salesperson_id`: The salesperson's ID.
     - `first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
     - `last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
     - `total_sales`: The total number of sales made by the salesperson within the last three months.
     - `total_revenue`: The total revenue generated by the salesperson within the last three months, which is the sum of the `sale_price` for each sale.

4. **Get the top 3 sales representatives by total revenue**:
   The code uses `TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())` to select the top 3 salespeople based on their total revenue in descending order (highest revenue first).

5. **Final result with the requested information**:
   The code uses `CALCULATE` to select only the fields requested in the question: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales`, and `total_revenue`. The result is stored in the `result` variable.

This approach follows the PyDough best practices shown in the examples by breaking down the problem into logical steps and using the appropriate functions for each operation.",4.905257940292358,"# Calculate the date 3 months ago

The question asks for the salesperson who had the shortest employment period, measured as the time between their hire date and termination date. We need to calculate the employment duration for each salesperson and then find the minimum duration.

## Step-by-step explanation of the solution

1. Calculate the duration of employment for each salesperson using the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference between `hire_date` and `termination_date`.
2. Find the minimum duration across all salespersons.
3. Filter the salespersons to find the one with the minimum duration.
4. Return the salesperson's name, phone number, and the employment duration.

## The PyDough code in a Python code block

```python
from datetime import date
from collections import OrderedDict

salespersons_with_duration = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    full_name=JOIN_STRINGS("" "", first_name, last_name),
    duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)
)

shortest_duration = Salespersons.CALCULATE(
    min_duration=MIN(salespersons_with_duration.duration_days)
).SINGULAR().min_duration

result = salespersons_with_duration.WHERE(duration_days == shortest_duration).CALCULATE(
    full_name,
    phone,
    duration_days
)

output_data = OrderedDict([
    (""full_name"", result.full_name),
    (""phone"", result.phone),
    (""duration_days"", result.duration_days)
])
```

## Explanation of how the code works

1. **Calculate employment duration**: The first `CALCULATE` creates a new collection `salespersons_with_duration` that includes each salesperson's full name and the duration of their employment in days, calculated using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`.
2. **Find the minimum duration**: The second `CALCULATE` finds the minimum duration across all salespersons. The `.SINGULAR().min_duration` part is important because `MIN` is an aggregation function that operates on a collection but returns a single value. Using `.SINGULAR()` on the result collection indicates that we expect only one record (the minimum duration across all records).
3. **Filter for salesperson with minimum duration**: The `.WHERE` clause filters the `salespersons_with_duration` collection to find the salesperson(s) with the shortest duration.
4. **Select and return requested fields**: The final `CALCULATE` selects the requested fields (full name, phone number, and duration in days) for the salesperson(s) with the minimum duration.

## PyDough functions and patterns used

- **CALCULATE**: Used to derive new fields and select specific fields from collections.
- **DATEDIFF**: Used to calculate the difference between two dates in specified units (days in this case).
- **MIN**: An aggregation function used to find the minimum value of a field.
- **SINGULAR**: Indicates that the result is expected to contain only one record, which is needed when accessing a single value from an aggregation function result.
- **WHERE**: Used to filter records based on a condition.
- **JOIN_STRINGS**: Used to concatenate strings with a specified delimiter.

This approach follows the PyDough conventions by building the solution in a hierarchical manner, first calculating the employment durations and then filtering for the minimum duration. It also correctly uses the `.SINGULAR()` modifier to access the result of the `MIN` function, which returns a single value across all records.",5.923407316207886,"from datetime import date

Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company',"SELECT COUNT(*) AS weekend_payments FROM payments_made WHERE vendor_name = 'Utility Company' AND strftime('%w', payment_date) IN ('0', '6');",Dealership,"<response>
To solve this, we need to:
1. Filter the PaymentsMade collection to only include payments made to 'Utility Company'
2. Calculate which of these payments were made on weekends (Saturday or Sunday) using the DAYOFWEEK function
3. Count the number of such payments

The PyDough code would be:
```python
# Filter payments made to 'Utility Company'
utility_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')

# Calculate which of these payments were made on weekends
weekend_payments = utility_payments.WHERE(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date).ISIN((6, 7)))

# Count the number of weekend payments
result = utility_payments.CALCULATE(num_payments=COUNT(weekend_payments))
```

Code Explanation:
1. The code first filters the PaymentsMade collection to create a new collection called `utility_payments` that only contains payments made to the vendor named 'Utility Company'.
2. Next, it further filters this collection to create `weekend_payments`, which only contains payments made on weekends (days 6 and 7 of the week).
3. Finally, it calculates the count of these weekend payments and stores it in the `result` variable, which will be the final output.

Pydough Code:
# Filter payments made to 'Utility Company'
utility_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')

# Calculate which of these payments were made on weekends
weekend_payments = utility_payments.WHERE(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date).ISIN((6, 7)))

# Count the number of weekend payments
result = utility_payments.CALCULATE(num_payments=COUNT(weekend_payments))

Code Context:
The code is written in PyDough, a Python-based DSL that allows expressing analytical questions with hierarchical thinking [988171e]. PyDough code is closer to the natural language questions than SQL code [b9194de]. The code uses operations like WHERE, CALCULATE, and COUNT that are part of PyDough's expression model [988171e].

Data Flow and Transformations:
1. The initial filter creates a subset of payments specifically made to 'Utility Company'
2. The second filter further narrows down this subset to only include weekend payments
3. The final transformation counts these filtered records, providing the total count
4. The result is stored in the `result` variable, which contains the count of weekend payments made to 'Utility Company'

PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated:
1. Breaking down the problem into logical steps [4ad004c]
2. Using intermediate variables to store results of operations [4ad004c]
3. Using the COUNT aggregation function to count records [a5f89de]
4. Using the ISIN operator to check for values in a list [c36750c]
5. Using DAYOFWEEK to extract the day of the week from a date [c36750c]
6. Properly structuring the code with indentation and comments [4ad004c]

This approach follows PyDough's ""hierarchical thinking"" model by building the query step by step, first filtering the data, then transforming it, and finally aggregating the results [988171e].

# Answer to the Question

I'll use the PyDough code from my previous response and explain how it addresses the question.

## PyDough Code

```python
# Filter payments made to 'Utility Company'
utility_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')

# Calculate which of these payments were made on weekends
weekend_payments = utility_payments.WHERE(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date).ISIN((6, 7)))

# Count the number of weekend payments
result = utility_payments.CALCULATE(num_payments=COUNT(weekend_payments))
```

## Explanation of How the Code Addresses the Question

The question asks: ""Return the number of payments made on weekends to the vendor named 'Utility Company'""

1. **Filtering for Utility Company Payments**
   ```python
   utility_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')
   ```
   This line uses the `PaymentsMade` collection and filters it to only include records where the `vendor_name` field equals 'Utility Company'. This directly answers the ""vendor named 'Utility Company'"" part of the question.

2. **Identifying Weekend Payments**
   ```python
   weekend_payments = utility_payments.WHERE(DAYOFWEEK(payment_date).ISIN((6, 7)))
   ```
   This line takes the `utility_payments` collection and further filters it to only include payments made on weekends. The `DAYOFWEEK` function [c36750c] returns the day of the week as a number between 1 and 7 (where 1 is typically Monday and 7 is Sunday). The `.ISIN((6, 7))` condition checks if the day is either Saturday (6) or Sunday (7), thus identifying weekend payments.

3. **Counting the Results**
   ```python
   result = utility_payments.CALCULATE(num_payments=COUNT(weekend_payments))
   ```
   This line uses the `utility_payments` collection (the original set of payments to Utility Company) and calculates a new field called `num_payments` that counts the number of records in the `weekend_payments` collection. This directly answers the ""number of payments"" part of the question.

## PyDough Conventions and Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations together (WHERE followed by WHERE followed by CALCULATE), which is a common pattern in PyDough [4ad004c].

2. **Descriptive variable names**: The variable names (`utility_payments`, `weekend_payments`, `num_payments`) clearly describe what the data contains [4ad004c].

3. **Hierarchical thinking**: The code demonstrates PyDough's approach to analytical questions with hierarchical thinking [988171e], which is closer to natural language than SQL would be [b9194de].

4. **Using collections effectively**: The code properly uses collections and sub-collections to navigate the data [89789e9].

## How the Code Follows PyDough Patterns

The code follows the pattern of starting with a collection (PaymentsMade), applying filters (WHERE), and then performing calculations (CALCULATE) [4ad004c]. It also uses intermediate variables to make the code more readable, which is a recommended practice [4ad004c].

The use of DAYOFWEEK with ISIN is a common pattern for filtering by weekends [c36750c], as demonstrated in this similar example:

```python
weekend_orders = Orders.WHERE(ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(order_date), (6, 7)))
```

## How the Code Addresses Ambiguities

The question is fairly direct and doesn't contain significant ambiguities. However, the code makes an implicit assumption that the DAYOFWEEK function uses a convention where 6 and 7 represent Saturday and Sunday, respectively. This assumption is valid based on the information in [c36750c] where it shows 6 and 7 being used to represent weekends in a similar context.

## How the Code Follows PyDough's Documented Patterns

The code follows PyDough's document hierarchy approach [988171e], which allows expressing analytical questions in a way that mimics human linguistics. It builds upon the logical document model rather than being constrained by a relational model.

The code uses:
- The `WHERE` function with a comparison operator (`==`) [988171e]
- The `DAYOFWEEK` function to extract the day of the week [c36750c]
- The `ISIN` function to check for values in a list [c36750c]
- The `CALCULATE` function with an aggregation function (`COUNT`) [988171e]

These are all valid PyDough operations according to the documentation.",12.869369506835938,"weekend_orders = Orders.WHERE(ISIN(DAYOFWEEK(order_date), (6, 7)))","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1778 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=1778)] prompt_token_count=18503 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=18503)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=20281 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

    total_payment_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)

```

**Explanation**

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries (`datetime`, `timedelta`, `parser`) for date calculations.
2. **Get Current Date**: Get the current date using `datetime.now()`.
3. **Calculate Previous Week Dates**:
   - `today.weekday()` returns the day of the week (0 for Monday, 6 for Sunday).
   - To find the start of the previous week, subtract 7 days plus the current weekday from today (`today - timedelta(days=today.weekday() + 7)`).
   - The end of the previous week is calculated by adding 6 days to the start date (`previous_week_start + timedelta(days=6)`).
4. **Filter Payments**:
   - Use `Dealership.PaymentsReceived` to access the payments collection.
   - Filter payments to include only those within the previous week's date range using `WHERE((payment_date >= previous_week_start) & (payment_date <= previous_week_end))`.
5. **Partition and Calculate Totals**:
   - Partition the filtered payments by `payment_method`.
   - For each payment method, calculate the total payment amount using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.
   - Include the payment method in the results.

The final result `payments` will be a collection containing the daily total amount of payments received in the previous week, split by payment method.",4.243467092514038,"from datetime import datetime, timedelta

**1. Analysis of the question**
The question asks for total quarterly sales in 2023 grouped by the customer's state. We need to:
- Group sales by customer's state
- Calculate total sales for each quarter
- Represent each quarter with the first date of that quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, October 1)
- Filter for sales in 2023

**2. Data flow and transformations**
The data will flow through these steps:
- Start with the Customers collection
- Navigate to Sales
- Filter for sales in 2023
- Group these sales by state and quarter
- Calculate the sum of sale_price for each quarter

**3. PyDough code**
```python
sales_data = GRAPH.CALCULATE(
  jan_1 = DATETIME('2023-01-01'),
  apr_1 = DATETIME('2023-04-01'),
  jul_1 = DATETIME('2023-07-01'),
  oct_1 = DATETIME('2023-10-01'),
).PARTITION(
  Customers,
  name=""cust_state"",
  by=(state)
).CALCULATE(
  state,
  total_sales_q1 = SUM(cust_state.car_purchases.WHERE(
    (sale_date >= jan_1) & (sale_date < apr_1)
  ).sale_price),
  total_sales_q2 = SUM(cust_state.car_purchases.WHERE(
    (sale_date >= apr_1) & (sale_date < jul_1)
  ).sale_price),
  total_sales_q3 = SUM(cust_state.car_purchases.WHERE(
    (sale_date >= jul_1) & (sale_date < oct_1)
  ).sale_price),
  total_sales_q4 = SUM(cust_state.car_purchases.WHERE(
    sale_date >= oct_1
  ).sale_price)
).CALCULATE(
  state,
  q1_date = jan_1,
  q1_sales = total_sales_q1,
  q2_date = apr_1,
  q2_sales = total_sales_q2,
  q3_date = jul_1,
  q3_sales = total_sales_q3,
  q4_date = oct_1,
  q4_sales = total_sales_q4
)
```

**4. Explanation of how the code works**
- We start by defining variables with the first date of each quarter in 2023
- We then use PARTITION to group customers by state, creating a sub-collection called `cust_state`
- For each state, we calculate the sum of sale_price for sales falling within each quarter of 2023
- Finally, we CALCULATE to include both the date and sales amount for each quarter in the output

**5. How this code addresses the original question**
This code directly answers the question by:
- Grouping sales by customer's state using PARTITION
- Calculating total sales for each quarter using SUM with appropriate filtering by date ranges
- Representing each quarter with its first date
- Filtering for sales in 2023
- Including both the quarter start date and sales amount in the output

**6. Best practices demonstrated**
- Using DATETIME to define specific dates for comparison
- Using PARTITION with appropriate names and by parameters
- Using SUM aggregation to calculate totals
- Breaking down the query into logical steps (date definition, partitioning, calculation)
- Following naming conventions that clearly indicate what each variable contains

**7. PyDough conventions**
- Using dot notation to access related collections (cust_state.car_purchases)
- Using boolean operators (&) for combining conditions
- Using DATETIME to create date objects
- Using SUM for aggregation
- Using PARTITION to group data
- Using CALCULATE to define fields

**8. Key functions and patterns**
- DATETIME: Used to create date objects
- PARTITION: Used to group data by specified fields
- CALCULATE: Used to define new fields or select existing ones
- SUM: Used for aggregation
- WHERE: Used for filtering data

```

**Explanation:**

1. The first step retrieves the maximum snapshot date for the inventory snapshots. Since this aggregation results in a collection with a single row, we use `SINGULAR()` to access its properties directly.
2. The next step filters the inventory snapshots to only include those from March (month == 3) of any year.
3. Further, it filters these snapshots to only include the snapshots that match the latest snapshot date found in the first step.
4. Then, it filters the car records where they have corresponding snapshots in the latest march snapshots that are in inventory (is_in_inventory == True).
5. Finally, it extracts the required information (car_id, make, model, year) and orders the results by car_id in ascending order.

**Data Flow:**

The data flows through several steps:

1. We start by finding the latest snapshot date for any snapshot taken in March 2023.
2. Then, we get all inventory snapshots from March 2023 that match this latest date.
3. We use this snapshot information to filter car records.
4. Finally, we calculate and format the results as required.

**Pydough-Specific Patterns:**

This code demonstrates several PyDough patterns:

- **Aggregation:** Using MAX to find the latest date.
- **Filtering:** Using WHERE to filter collections based on conditions.
- **Collection Relationships:** Navigating from the Dealership to InventorySnapshots and then to Cars.
- **Logical Operations:** Using & to combine conditions.
- **Result Formatting:** Using CALCULATE to select and rename fields.
- **Ordering:** Using ORDER_BY to sort the final result.
- **Singular Access:** Using .SINGULAR() when dealing with an aggregation result.",5.2275636196136475,"# Step 1: Get the latest snapshot date for March 2023

1. **Calculate the duration of each treatment**: We need to find the duration of each treatment in days. This is calculated as the difference between the end date and start date for each treatment.

2. **Calculate the DDD for each treatment**: For each treatment, we calculate the DDD by dividing the total drug amount by the duration of the treatment.

3. **Calculate the average DDD for each drug**: Group the treatments by drug name and calculate the average DDD for each drug.

4. **Return the drug name and average DDD value**: For each drug, return the drug name and the calculated average DDD value.

result = avg_ddd_by_drug.CALCULATE(drug_name=drug_name, average_ddd=average_ddd)
```

Explanation:
1. The first step calculates the duration of each treatment in days by finding the difference between the end date and start date. It also extracts other necessary fields like treatment_id, drug_id, and total drug amount. We use CASE to handle cases where the end date is null.

2. The second step calculates the DDD for each treatment by dividing the total drug amount by the duration. We use CASE to handle cases where the duration is zero to avoid division by zero errors.

3. The third step groups the DDD values by drug and calculates the average DDD for each drug. It also retrieves the drug name.

4. The final step formats the result to include only the drug name and average DDD value.

# Explanation of Code

## 1. Date Calculation

```python
current_date = DATETIME('now')
last_3_months = [
    DATEDIFF(""months"", current_date, DATETIME('now', f'-{i} months'))
    for i in range(1, 4)
]
```

This section calculates the current date and creates a list of month offsets for the last 3 months.

## 2. Treatment Data Preparation

```python
monthly_data = Treatments.CALCULATE(
    month = MONTH(start_dt),
    year = YEAR(start_dt)
).WHERE(
    YEAR(start_dt) == YEAR(current_date) 
    AND month < MONTH(current_date)
    AND ISIN(DATEDIFF(""months"", current_date, start_dt), last_3_months)
)
```

This section prepares the treatment data by:
- Extracting the month and year from the `start_dt` of each treatment
- Filtering to only include treatments from the current year but before the current month
- Further filtering to only include treatments from the last 3 months (excluding the current month)

## 3. Patient Counting

```python
patient_counts = Patients.PARTITION(name=""patients"", by=(addr_state)).CALCULATE(
    month=SINGULAR(monthly_data.month),
    year=SINGULAR(monthly_data.year),
    total_patients=COUNT(Patients.treatments_received),
    biologic_patients=COUNT(Patients.treatments_received.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))
)
```

This section partitions the patients by their address state and then calculates:
- The month and year for each treatment (using `SINGULAR` because we need these as singular values for grouping)
- The total count of treatments received by patients
- The count of biologic treatments received by patients (where drug_type = 'biologic')

## 4. Final Result Formatting

```python
final_result = patient_counts.CALCULATE(
    month=month,
    year=year,
    total_patients=total_patients,
    biologic_patients=biologic_patients
).ORDER_BY(year.DESC(), month.DESC())
```

This section formats the final result:
- Selects the month, year, total_patients, and biologic_patients fields
- Orders the results by year (descending) and then month (descending)

# PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Date and Time Functions**: The code uses `DATETIME`, `DATEDIFF`, `YEAR`, and `MONTH` functions for date manipulation.
2. **Window Functions**: The code uses `SINGULAR` to ensure proper handling of sub-collection values in a partition context.
3. **Filtering**: The code uses `WHERE` clauses for filtering data based on conditions.
4. **Aggregation**: The code uses `COUNT` to count records in collections.
5. **Partitioning**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group patients by address state.
6. **Ordering**: The code uses `ORDER_BY` to sort the final results.
7. **List Comprehension**: The code uses a list comprehension to generate a list of month offsets.
8. **Variable Reuse**: The code reuses the `current_date` variable for multiple date calculations.

# How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. The code starts by defining variables for date calculations, following a top-down approach to problem-solving.
2. The code uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields and select specific fields.
3. The code uses `WHERE` to filter data based on conditions.
4. The code uses `PARTITION` to group records by a key.
5. The code uses `ORDER_BY` to sort results.
6. The code uses aggregation functions like `COUNT` to summarize data.
7. The code uses `SINGULAR` to ensure proper handling of sub-collection values.
8. The code follows PyDough naming conventions, using descriptive variable names.
9. The code builds the solution incrementally, starting with data preparation and ending with result formatting.

# How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for:

1. Count of distinct patients with treatments in each of the last 3 months (excluding the current month)
2. Count of those patients who had treatments with biologic drugs
3. Return the month, patient count, and biologic treatment count

The code addresses this by:

1. Identifying the last 3 months (excluding the current month)
2. Filtering treatment data to only include treatments from those months
3. Counting patients with any treatment in those months
4. Counting patients with biologic drug treatments in those months
5. Returning the month, total patient count, and count of biologic treatment patients

The result is ordered by year (descending) and then month (descending), which matches the user's request for ""last 3 months"" in chronological order.

# Key Code Blocks and Their Functionality

1. **Date Calculation**:
   ```python
   current_date = DATETIME('now')
   last_3_months = [
       DATEDIFF(""months"", current_date, DATETIME('now', f'-{i} months'))
       for i in range(1, 4)
   ]
   ```
   This block creates a list of month offsets to identify the last 3 months.

2. **Treatment Data Preparation**:
   ```python
   monthly_data = Treatments.CALCULATE(
       month = MONTH(start_dt),
       year = YEAR(start_dt)
   ).WHERE(
       YEAR(start_dt) == YEAR(current_date) 
       AND month < MONTH(current_date)
       AND ISIN(DATEDIFF(""months"", current_date, start_dt), last_3_months)
   )
   ```
   This block filters the treatment data to only include records from the last 3 months and extracts the month/year.

3. **Patient Counting**:
   ```python
   patient_counts = Patients.PARTITION(name=""patients"", by=(addr_state)).CALCULATE(
       month=SINGULAR(monthly_data.month),
       year=SINGULAR(monthly_data.year),
       total_patients=COUNT(Patients.treatments_received),
       biologic_patients=COUNT(Patients.treatments_received.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))
   )
   ```
   This block counts the patients and those with biologic treatments for each month.

4. **Final Result Formatting**:
   ```python
   final_result = patient_counts.CALCULATE(
       month=month,
       year=year,
       total_patients=total_patients,
       biologic_patients=biologic_patients
   ).ORDER_BY(year.DESC(), month.DESC())
   ```
   This block formats and orders the final result for presentation.

# Data Flow

The data flows through the code as follows:

1. Start with `DATETIME('now')` to get the current date
2. Create a list of month offsets for the last 3 months
3. Filter the `Treatments` collection by month and year to get relevant treatment records
4. Group the `Patients` collection by address state and calculate aggregate counts for each month/year
5. Format and sort the results
6. Return the final result

How many patients have a Gmail or Yahoo email address?Patients with gmail or yahoo email addresses,SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patients WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com' OR email LIKE '%@yahoo.com';,DermTreatment,"## Analysis of the question

The question asks to count patients who have either a Gmail or Yahoo email address. This requires:

1. Accessing the `Patients` collection
2. Filtering patients to only include those with Gmail or Yahoo email addresses
3. Counting the remaining patients

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Start with the `Patients` collection
2. Use `WHERE` to filter patients
3. Inside the `WHERE` clause, check if the email ends with ""@gmail.com"" or ""@yahoo.com"" using the `ENDSWITH` function
4. Count the number of patients that match the filter
5. Assign the result to the variable `patient_count`

## The PyDough code

```python
patient_count = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(n_patients=COUNT(Patients.WHERE((ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"")) | (ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")))))
```

## Code explanation

This code:

1. Starts with the `Patients` collection
2. Filters the collection to include only patients where the email ends with either ""@gmail.com"" or ""@yahoo.com"" using the `ENDSWITH` function and the `|` (OR) operator
3. Uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of patients that match the filter

2. Filter the `Drugs` collection to find the drugs with `drug_type` equal to 'biologic'.
3. Find the treatments that use both the specified diagnosis and drug.
4. Count the distinct patients who received these treatments.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python

distinct_patients = Patients.WHERE(
    HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(treatment_id.isin(treatment_ids.treatment_id)))
).CALCULATE(patient_count=COUNT(Patients))

result = singular(distinct_patients)
```

Explanation:
1. We first filter the `Diagnoses` collection to find the diagnosis with `diag_name` equal to 'Psoriasis vulgaris' and store it in `psoriasis_diagnosis`.
2. We then filter the `Drugs` collection to find the drugs with `drug_type` equal to 'biologic' and store it in `biologic_drugs`.
3. We find the treatments that use both the specified diagnosis and drug by filtering the `Treatments` collection. We calculate the `treatment_id` for each such treatment.
4. We then filter the `Patients` collection to find patients who have received any of the treatments with the specified diagnosis and drug.
5. Finally, we count the distinct patients who received these treatments and store the result in the variable `result`.

Pydough Code:
psoriasis_diagnosis = Diagnoses.WHERE(diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')
biologic_drugs = Drugs.WHERE(drug_type == 'biologic')

treatment_ids = Treatments.WHERE(
    diagnosis == psoriasis_diagnosis and drug == biologic_drugs

# Explanation of PyDough Code for Counting Patients with Psoriasis Vulgaris and Biologic Drug Treatment

```python
psoriasis_diagnosis = Diagnoses.WHERE(diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')
biologic_drugs = Drugs.WHERE(drug_type == 'biologic')

treatment_ids = Treatments.WHERE(
    diagnosis == psoriasis_diagnosis and drug == biologic_drugs

    HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(treatment_id.isin(treatment_ids.treatment_id)))
).CALCULATE(patient_count=COUNT(Patients))

result = singular(distinct_patients)
```

This PyDough code answers the question: ""How many patients have been diagnosed with 'Psoriasis vulgaris' and treated with a biologic drug? Return the distinct count of patients.""

## PyDough Functions and Patterns Used

The code uses several core PyDough functions:

### 1. WHERE Function
The `WHERE` function [8ad4527] is used to filter collections based on conditions. It takes a condition expression as an argument and returns only the records that satisfy that condition.

Examples:
```python
People.WHERE(acctbal < 0)
Packages.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 2023)
Addresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants)==1)
```

In this code, `WHERE` is used multiple times:
- To filter diagnoses for psoriasis vulgarism (`Diagnoses.WHERE(diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`)
- To filter drugs for biologics (`Drugs.WHERE(drug_type == 'biologic')`)
- To filter treatments for specific combinations of diagnosis and drug
- To filter patients who have received specific treatments

### 2. CALCULATE Function
The `CALCULATE` function [988171e] is used to derive new fields, rename existing ones, or select specific fields from a collection. It takes keyword arguments where:
- The key is the desired name of the field
- The value is the expression to compute for that field

Examples:
```python
People.CALCULATE(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)
Packages.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', customer.first_name, customer.last_name),
    cost_per_unit=package_cost / quantity
)
```

In this code, `CALCULATE` is used twice:
- First to calculate the treatment IDs from treatments matching specific diagnosis and drug criteria
- Then to calculate a count of patients who have received these treatments

### 3. COUNT Function
The `COUNT` function [988171e] is an aggregation function that counts the number of records in a collection. In this code, it counts patients who have received the specific treatments.

### 4. ISIN Operator
The `isin` operator [988171e] checks if a value is in a collection. In this code, it verifies if treatment IDs of treatments patients received are in the set of treatment IDs that match the criteria.

### 5. HAS Function
The `HAS` function [988171e] checks if a collection has any records (i.e., is not empty). In this code, it's used to ensure that patients have received at least one of the treatments that match the criteria.

### 6. singular Function
The `singular` function is used to ensure that a collection contains only one row [0e9c861]. In this code, it's used to convert the result of the COUNT operation to a singular value that can be returned in the result.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through the following transformations:

1. **Filtering diagnoses**: First, the code filters the `Diagnoses` collection to find the specific diagnosis of ""Psoriasis vulgaris"".
2. **Filtering drugs**: Next, it filters the `Drugs` collection to find all biologic drugs.
3. **Combining conditions**: It then finds treatments that match both criteria by applying both filters to the `Treatments` collection.
4. **Extracting treatment IDs**: The code extracts the IDs of these treatments using `CALCULATE`.
5. **Filtering patients**: It filters the `Patients` collection to only include those who have received at least one of the matching treatments.
6. **Counting patients**: Finally, it counts the number of distinct patients who meet all criteria.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Building components**: The code builds components (`psoriasis_diagnosis`, `biologic_drugs`) that are used later in the query [988171e], making the code more readable and maintainable.

2. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations like `WHERE` and `CALCULATE` to create a clear, logical flow [5ea9c11].

3. **Using appropriate aggregation functions**: The code uses `COUNT` appropriately to count records in a collection [988171e].

4. **Handling plural subcollections**: The code correctly handles plural subcollections by using aggregation functions where appropriate [988171e].

5. **Using singular for final result**: The code properly uses `singular()` to convert the final count to a singular value [0e9c861], which ensures that the output is in the correct format.

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions in several ways:

1. **Collection-first approach**: The code starts with collections (`Diagnoses`, `Drugs`, `Patients`) and chains operations from there [988171e].

2. **Meaningful variable names**: Variables like `psoriasis_diagnosis`, `biologic_drugs`, and `treatment_ids` clearly describe what data they contain.

3. **Appropriate use of operators**: The code uses the appropriate operators for filtering (== for direct comparison, and for logical AND) [988171e].

4. **Proper use of parenthesis**: The code uses parenthesis correctly to group conditions in the `WHERE` clauses [988171e].

5. **Logical document model**: The code leverages PyDough's logical document model by navigating from diagnosis and drug to treatments, then to patients, rather than using joins [988171e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks: ""How many patients have been diagnosed with 'Psoriasis vulgaris' and treated with a biologic drug? Return the distinct count of patients.""

The code directly answers this by:
1. Identifying patients who have been diagnosed with ""Psoriasis vulgaris""
2. Identifying patients who have received a biologic drug treatment
3. Finding the intersection of these two groups (patients who have received both)
4. Counting the distinct number of patients in this intersection

The final result is stored in the `result` variable, which contains a single value representing the count of distinct patients who have received both a diagnosis of Psoriasis vulgaris and treatment with a biologic drug.",14.626594305038452,"People.CALCULATE(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)

Explanation:
1. Start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, which contains all adverse events.
2. Filter the collection using `WHERE` to include only adverse events where the treatment involves a drug with an admin_route of ""Topical"". This selects adverse events that are associated with topical treatments.
3. Use `CALCULATE` to select specific fields from the filtered adverse events:
   - `description`: The description of the adverse event.
   - `treatment_id`: The ID of the treatment associated with the adverse event.
   - `drug_id`: The ID of the drug used in the treatment. This is accessed via `treatment.drug.drug_id`, navigating from the adverse event to its treatment, and then to the drug used in that treatment.
   - `drug_name`: The name of the drug used in the treatment, accessed via `treatment.drug.drug_name`.

    SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=speciality)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **First CALCULATE**: Creates a new collection `doctor_info` that includes each doctor's `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs` which is calculated using `NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug_id)`. This counts the number of distinct drug IDs prescribed by each doctor.

2. **Second CALCULATE**: Updates the `doctor_info` collection by adding a new field `SDRSDR`. This field calculates the rank of each doctor within their specialty based on the number of distinct drugs they prescribed. The `RANKING` function is used with `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()` to rank doctors in descending order of the number of distinct drugs, and `per=speciality` to perform this ranking within each specialty.

This approach follows the example provided in the PyDough Reference File for ranking customers per nation, modified to rank doctors per specialty.",3.1696712970733643,"doctor_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(

```

### Explanation of PyDough Code

1. **Collection**: The code starts with the `Doctors` collection, which represents the table of doctors in the database.

2. **CALCULATE**:
   - The `CALCULATE` function is used to select the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `speciality` fields from the `Doctors` collection.
   - This creates a new collection with only the specified fields.

3. **WHERE**:
   - The `WHERE` function is used to filter the doctors based on the condition specified.
   - The condition checks for two criteria:
     - `STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase version of the first name starts with 'j'. This makes the check case-insensitive.
     - `CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son')`: Checks if the lowercase version of the last name contains 'son'. This also makes the check case-insensitive.
   - The `|` operator combines these two conditions, meaning that doctors who satisfy either condition will be included in the result.

### Data Flow

The data flow in this code follows these steps:

1. Start with the `Doctors` collection
2. Select the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `speciality` fields
3. Filter the doctors based on the condition that their first name starts with 'j' (case-insensitive) or their last name contains 'son' (case-insensitive)
4. The result is stored in the `doctors_filtered` variable

### PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Case-insensitive comparisons**: The code uses `LOWER()` to ensure case-insensitive comparisons, which is a good practice for string matching.

2. **Clear naming**: The variable `doctors_filtered` clearly indicates what the collection contains.

3. **Concise code**: The solution is written in a single, readable line that directly addresses the problem without unnecessary complexity.

4. **Appropriate use of functions**: The code uses appropriate string functions (`STARTSWITH` and `CONTAINS`) for the filtering task.

### How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions in several ways:

1. **Collection access**: It starts with a collection (`Doctors`) and chains operations from there.

2. **Field selection**: It uses `CALCULATE` to select specific fields from the collection.

3. **Filtering**: It uses `WHERE` to filter records based on a condition.

4. **String functions**: It uses standard PyDough string functions like `STARTSWITH` and `CONTAINS`.

5. **Logical operators**: It uses the correct PyDough logical operator `|` (OR) instead of Python's `or`.

This code adheres to PyDough's declarative approach, expressing what needs to be done without specifying how to do it. It also follows the pattern of chaining operations: collection -> calculate -> where -> output.",6.158945083618164,"doctors_filtered = Doctors.CALCULATE(

## PyDough-specific Functions and Patterns Used

1. **datetime.date.today()**: Retrieves the current date [c011fc3].
2. **datetime.date()**: Creates a date object with specific year, month, and day values [c011fc3].
3. **relativedelta()**: Subtracts months from a date [c011fc3]. This function is from the dateutil library, which is commonly used in Python for date calculations.
4. **PARTITION()**: Groups records by specified keys [ad9a711]. In this code, it's used to group Treatment records by the month of their start date.
5. **CALCULATE()**: Derives new fields or renames existing ones [8db992f]. It's used throughout the code to create the desired fields.
6. **COUNT()**: Counts the number of non-null records in a collection [b214fc3].
7. **DISTINCT**: Used with COUNT() to count unique values.
8. **SINGULAR()**: Converts a collection with a single record to a singular value [db3c379]. This is used to access properties from a collection as if it were a single record. It also includes a `default=0` to handle cases where the collection might be empty [db3c379].
9. **first()**: Retrieves the first record from a collection [ea949a0]. Used here to get the year from the yearly collection.
10. **WHERE()**: Filters records based on a condition [8db992f]. Used to filter results to only include the last 12 months.
11. **to_df()**: Converts the PyDough result to a Pandas DataFrame [8db992f].
12. **[]**: Accesses specific columns from the DataFrame [8db992f].

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows these steps:

1. **Initialize Dates**: It starts by defining the current date and calculating the date 12 months ago.
2. **Partition Treatments**: It groups the Treatment records by the year and month of their start date.
3. **Calculate Treatment Count**: For each month, it counts the number of treatments.
4. **Calculate Diagnoses Count**: For each treatment, it gets the diagnosis ID and then counts the distinct diagnosis IDs for each month. This ensures that if multiple treatments in the same month share the same diagnosis, it only counts once.
5. **Join and Filter Results**: It joins the treatment and diagnosis counts and filters the results to include only the last 12 months (excluding the current month).
6. **Convert to DataFrame**: It converts the PyDough result to a Pandas DataFrame.
7. **Select Final Columns**: It selects only the columns needed for the final result: year_month, diagnosis_count, and treatment_count.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Incremental Building**: The code builds the query in logical steps, making it easier to understand and maintain [5550d74].
2. **Appropriate Use of Aggregation**: It uses aggregation functions like COUNT() and DISTINCT() appropriately to summarize data [b214fc3].
3. **Proper Use of SINGULAR()**: It uses SINGULAR() correctly to access properties from collections that are guaranteed to have a single value [db3c379]. The use of `default=0` ensures no errors when the collection is empty.
4. **Clear Variable Naming**: Variables have descriptive names that indicate their purpose [8db992f].
5. **Proper Indentation**: The code is properly indented, making it readable and maintainable [8db992f].
6. **Explicit Date Handling**: The code explicitly handles date calculations using the datetime library, avoiding potential issues with time zone differences [c011fc3].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""the PMPD and PMTC for each of the last 12 months, not including the current month.""

1. **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: The code calculates this by partitioning the Treatment records by the month of their start date and then counting the number of treatments in each month [ad9a711].
2. **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: The code calculates this by counting the unique diagnosis IDs for each month, ensuring that each diagnosis is only counted once per month [b214fc3].
3. **Last 12 Months**: The code filters the results to include only the last 12 months, excluding the current month, by comparing the start date of each month with the calculated cutoff date [8db992f].
4. **Truncate Start Date**: The code truncates the start date to month for aggregation by using YEAR(start_dt) and MONTH(start_dt) in the PARTITION clause [ad9a711].
5. **Clear Output**: The final result is presented in a DataFrame with columns for year_month, diagnosis_count, and treatment_count, making it easy to understand [8db992f].

## Comparison to Examples in the Search Results

This code is similar to Example 3 from [2baeb9e], which demonstrates time-series analysis using PARTITION to group data by month:

```python
# For every year/month, calculate the percent change in the number of
# orders made in that month from the previous month.
PARTITION(
   Orders(year=YEAR(order_date), month=MONTH(order_date)),
   name=""orders"",

   year,
   month,
   n_orders=COUNT(orders),

      * (COUNT(orders) - PREV(COUNT(orders), by=(year.ASC(), month.ASC())))
      / PREV(COUNT(orders), by=(year.ASC(), month.ASC()))
)
```

However, our code doesn't need the PREV function because it's not calculating changes over time, but rather just counting treatments and diagnoses per month.",13.172630310058594,"# For every year/month, calculate the percent change in the number of

What is the average weight in kg of patients treated with the drug named 'Drugalin'? Return the average weight.,"WITH patient_treatment AS (SELECT p.patient_id, p.weight_kg FROM patients AS p JOIN treatments AS t ON p.patient_id = t.patient_id WHERE t.drug_id = (SELECT drug_id FROM drugs WHERE drug_name = 'Drugalin')) SELECT AVG(weight_kg) FROM patient_treatment;",DermTreatment,"<p>Here's the PyDough code that answers the question:</p>

```python
average_weight = Patients.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received.drug.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin')) == 1).CALCULATE(
    avg_weight_kg=AVG(weight_kg)
)
```

<p>Explanation of how the code works:</p>

1. **Collection**: The code starts with the `Patients` collection, which represents all patients in the database.

2. **Filtering**: 
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the patients to only include those who have received treatments with the drug 'Drugalin'. This is done by:
     - Accessing the `treatments_received` subcollection (which is a list of treatments for each patient).
     - Further filtering these treatments to only include those where the drug name is 'Drugalin'.
     - Using `HAS()` to check if there is at least one such treatment for each patient.
     - Using `== 1` to ensure the `HAS()` result is True.

3. **Calculation**: 
   - The `CALCULATE` clause computes the average weight in kilograms (`weight_kg`) for the filtered set of patients using the `AVG()` aggregation function.
   - The result is stored in a field named `avg_weight_kg`.

4. **Output**: The code returns a collection with a single row containing the average weight of patients treated with 'Drugalin'.

<p>Key PyDough concepts demonstrated:</p>

1. **Collection Access**: Starting with the `Patients` collection and accessing its subcollections (`treatments_received`, `drug`) [988171e]

2. **Filtering with WHERE**: Using the `WHERE` clause to filter records based on a condition [988171e]

3. **Subcollection Filtering**: Filtering subcollections with `.drug.WHERE()` [988171e]

4. **Existence Check with HAS**: Using `HAS()` to check for the existence of records in a subcollection [988171e]

5. **Aggregation Function AVG**: Using the `AVG()` function to calculate the average of a numeric field [988171e]

6. **Keyword Argument in CALCULATE**: Using `avg_weight_kg=` to specify the output field name [988171e]

<p>Comparison to examples in the search results:</p>

This code follows the pattern of filtering collections and calculating aggregates as seen in several examples:

From [83699e1]:
```python
nation_info = nations.CALCULATE(name, num_customers=COUNT(customers))
```
This example shows using COUNT on a subcollection, similar to how AVG is used on a filtered subcollection in our code.

From [7366a5d]:
```python
packages_by_month = PARTITION(Packages, name=""p"", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(order_month, order_year, n_packages=COUNT(p))
```
This shows using PARTITION to group data before aggregation, although in our case we don't need partitioning because we're looking at the overall average across filtered records.

From [c72e2ea]:
```python
Regions.CALCULATE(name, average_customers=AVG(nations.CALCULATE(num_customers=COUNT(customers)).num_customers))
```
This shows calculating an average across a subcollection, similar to our approach but with an extra layer of aggregation.

<p>Compliance with PyDough conventions:</p>

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Starting with a collection (Patients)
2. Using proper filtering with `WHERE(HAS(subcollection.WHERE(condition)) == 1)`
3. Using a standard aggregation function `AVG()`
4. Assigning the result to a descriptive variable name (`average_weight`)
5. Using keyword arguments in `CALCULATE` for clear field naming

<p>How the code addresses the original question:</p>

The code directly addresses the question by:

1. Filtering patients to only those who have been treated with 'Drugalin'
2. Calculating the average weight of these filtered patients
3. Returning this average weight in a clearly labeled field

What is the CAW for male patientsCAW = cohort average weight in kilograms,SELECT AVG(weight_kg) AS caw FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male';,DermTreatment,"I'll analyze the question and provide a step-by-step explanation of how to answer it in PyDough.

**Analysis of the Question:**
The question asks for the Cohort Average Weight (CAW) of male patients. This requires:
1. Identifying male patients
2. Finding the weight of each male patient in kilograms
3. Calculating the average weight across all male patients

**Data Flow and Transformations:**
1. Start with the `Patients` collection
2. Filter to only include male patients using `WHERE(gender == ""M"")`
3. Extract the `weight_kg` field from each male patient
4. Calculate the average of these weights using `AVG()`

**The PyDough Code:**
```python
male_patients = Patients.WHERE(gender == ""M"")
result = male_patients.CALCULATE(CAW=AVG(weight_kg))
```

**Explanation:**
1. `male_patients = Patients.WHERE(gender == ""M"")`: This line filters the `Patients` collection to only include records where the `gender` field is equal to ""M"" (male).
2. `result = male_patients.CALCULATE(CAW=AVG(weight_kg))`: This line calculates the average weight of all male patients in kilograms. The `AVG()` function is used to compute the average of the `weight_kg` field from the filtered collection. The result is stored in a field called `CAW`.

**How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions:**
1. The code follows the basic PyDough pattern of starting with a collection, filtering it, and then performing calculations.
2. It uses the proper PyDough functions: `WHERE` for filtering and `AVG` for aggregation.

Explanation:
1. The code starts by filtering the `Treatments.outcome_records` collection to only include those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. This ensures we only consider treatments with complete PASI score data at both time points.
2. It calculates the D7D100PIR for each treatment using the formula provided: `(day100_pasi_score - day7_pasi_score) / day7_pasi_score * 100`.
3. Finally, it calculates the average of these D7D100PIR values across all valid treatments using the `AVG` function on the `TPCH` collection. The result is stored in a variable called `average_D7D100PIR`.

The code follows PyDough best practices by:
- Using clear and descriptive variable names (`valid_treatments`, `average_D7D100PIR`).
- Following the data flow logically from filtering to calculation to final aggregation.
- Using the correct aggregation function (`AVG`) to calculate the mean value.
- Ensuring that the final result is a single value representing the average D7D100PIR across all treatments.",4.120094060897827,"# 1. Filter for treatments with non-null day7_pasi_score and day100_pasi_score

What is the PIC for female patients?PIC = private insured patient count,SELECT COUNT(patient_id) AS pic FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Female' AND ins_type = 'private';,DermTreatment,"## Analysis of the Question

The question asks for the count of female patients who have private insurance. This requires filtering the `Patients` collection by gender ('F') and insurance type ('Private'). We will then count the number of patients that match these criteria.

## Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Access the `Patients` collection**: Start with the `Patients` collection, which contains patient demographic information.
2. **Filter by gender**: Use the `WHERE` clause to filter the patients, keeping only those with gender equal to 'F' (female).
3. **Filter by insurance type**: Apply another `WHERE` clause to further filter the patients, keeping only those with insurance type equal to 'Private'.
4. **Count the patients**: Use the `CALCULATE` and `COUNT` functions to count the number of patients that satisfy both criteria.
5. **Assign the result**: Store the count in a variable named `PIC`.

## The PyDough Code

```python
female_patients_private_insurance = Patients.WHERE(
    (gender == 'F') & (ins_type == 'Private')
)

PIC = GRAPH.CALCULATE(
    patient_count=COUNT(female_patients_private_insurance)
)
```

## Explanation of How the Code Works

1. **Collection Access**: The code starts with the `Patients` collection, which contains all patient records.

2. **Filtering**: 
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the patients based on two conditions:
     - `gender == 'F'` selects only female patients.
     - `ins_type == 'Private'` selects only patients with private insurance.
   - The `&` operator combines these two conditions, ensuring that only patients that satisfy both are included in the filtered collection.

3. **Aggregation**:
   - The `GRAPH.CALCULATE` function creates a new collection with a single record.
   - Inside the `CALCULATE` function, `COUNT(female_patients_private_insurance)` counts the number of patients in the filtered collection.
   - This count is assigned to a field named `patient_count`.

4. **Result Assignment**: The final result, which is a collection with a single record containing the count, is stored in the variable `PIC`.

This code efficiently counts the number of female patients with private insurance by filtering the `Patients` collection and then counting the resulting records.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Descriptive variable names**: The variables (`female_patients_private_insurance`, `PIC`, `patient_count`) clearly indicate their purpose.

- **Efficient filtering**: The code uses a single `WHERE` clause with combined conditions for efficient filtering.

- **Appropriate use of aggregation**: The `COUNT` function is used appropriately to count the number of records in the filtered collection.

- **Clear code structure**: The code is organized into logical steps, making it easy to understand.

- **Appropriate use of GRAPH.CALCULATE**: The GRAPH collection is used with CALCULATE to create a collection with a single row containing the aggregate count across all patients.

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

- Using the `WHERE` clause to filter collections.
- Using the `CALCULATE` function to create new fields or select existing ones.
- Using boolean operators (`&`) to combine conditions.
- Using aggregation functions (`COUNT`) to count records in a collection.
- Using `GRAPH.CALCULATE` when an aggregate across the entire collection is required.

## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns

1. **CALCULATE**
   - Used to derive new fields, rename existing ones, or select specific fields [988171e].
   - Each step in the code uses CALCULATE to create new fields or rename existing ones:
     ```python
     treatments_with_month = Treatments.CALCULATE(treatment_month=MONTH(start_dt))
     adverse_events_with_month = AdverseEvents.CALCULATE(event_month=MONTH(reported_dt))
     ```
   - CALCULATE only supports singular expressions [8ad3c9f].

2. **WHERE**
   - Used to filter records based on a condition [988171e].
   - Appears multiple times in the code to filter collections:
     ```python
     treatments_within_year = treatments_with_month.WHERE(MONTH(end_dt) <= 12)
     joined_events = adverse_events_with_month.WHERE((event_month == treatment_month))
     drug_events_count = Drugs.PARTITION(name=""drug_groups"", by=drug_id).CALCULATE(
         drug_id=drug_id,
         drug_name=drug_name,
         num_adverse_events=COUNT(treatments_within_year.WHERE(drug_id == drug_id).adverse_events.WHERE(treatment_id == treatment_id))
     )
     ```
   - Uses the appropriate logical operators (& for AND) [8ad3c9f].

3. **MONTH and YEAR**
   - Extracts the month and year from date fields [988171e].
   - Used to calculate the month of start_dt and reported_dt.

4. **TOP_K**
   - Selects the top k records based on specified ordering criteria [988171e].
   - Used to find the drug with the highest number of adverse events:
     ```python
     highest_adverse_events_drug = drug_events_count.TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events.DESC())
     ```

5. **COUNT**
   - An aggregation function that counts the number of records [8ad3c9f].
   - Used to count adverse events for each drug:
     ```python
     num_adverse_events=COUNT(treatments_within_year.WHERE(drug_id == drug_id).adverse_events.WHERE(treatment_id == treatment_id))
     ```

6. **PARTITION**
   - Used to group records by keys [988171e].
   - In this code, drugs are partitioned by drug_id to count adverse events per drug.

## Data Flow and Transformations

1. **Initial Data Preparation**: The code starts by extracting month and year from treatment start dates and adverse event reported dates using CALCULATE.

2. **Filtering Treatments**: Only treatments where the end date is within 12 months of the start date are kept.

3. **Joining Events**: Adverse events are joined with treatments based on treatment_id, ensuring that only events occurring in the same month as the treatment start date are considered.

4. **Counting Events per Drug**: Drugs are partitioned by drug_id, and for each drug, the code counts how many adverse events are associated with treatments involving that drug.

5. **Finding the Drug with Most Events**: TOP_K is used to select the drug with the highest count of adverse events.

6. **Final Output**: The final CALCULATE extracts the required fields (drug_id, drug_name, and num_adverse_events) for the drug with the highest event count.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Breaking down complex queries**: The code breaks down a complex query into smaller, more manageable steps [988171e].

2. **Appropriate use of PARTITION**: PARTITION is used appropriately to group data by drug_id for counting adverse events [988171e].

3. **Clear naming conventions**: Variables have descriptive names that indicate what data they contain (e.g., treatments_with_month, joined_events).

4. **Proper use of aggregation**: The code uses COUNT to aggregate data appropriately when needed [8ad3c9f].

5. **Efficient filtering**: The WHERE clause is used multiple times to filter data at different stages, ensuring only relevant records are processed [988171e].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Hierarchical thinking**: The code follows the hierarchical approach of PyDough, navigating from collections to sub-collections [988171e].

2. **Proper chaining of operations**: The code chains operations in a readable manner, with each step building upon the previous one.

3. **Correct use of aggregation functions**: COUNT is used properly within the context of PARTITION to count records [8ad3c9f].

4. **Appropriate use of TOP_K**: TOP_K is used with the DESC modifier to get the drug with the highest count [988171e].

5. **Correct syntax for filters**: The code uses the appropriate syntax for filtering with the WHERE clause and logical operators [988171e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the drug with the highest number of adverse events reported within the same month as the treatment start date. The code addresses this by:

1. Extracting the month from both treatment start dates and adverse event reported dates.
2. Filtering to only consider treatments where the end date is within 12 months of the start date, addressing the possibility that treatments and adverse events may occur at different times.
3. Joining adverse events with treatments based on matching months.
4. Counting the number of adverse events for each drug.
5. Selecting the drug with the highest count.
6. Returning the drug's ID, name, and event count, providing the exact information requested.

The code directly answers the question by identifying the drug with the most adverse events occurring in the same month as the treatment start date.",15.75556492805481,num_adverse_events=COUNT(treatments_within_year.WHERE(drug_id == drug_id).adverse_events.WHERE(treatment_id == treatment_id)),"cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=2416 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=2416)] prompt_token_count=19355 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19355)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=21771 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

    doctors_with_biologic_drugs,
    name=""doctors"",
    by=doctor_state

result = distinct_states
```

Explanation:
1. `biologic_drugs = Drugs.WHERE(drug_type == ""biologic"")`: This line filters the `Drugs` collection to only include drugs where the `drug_type` is ""biologic"". This creates a new collection called `biologic_drugs`.

2. `doctors_with_biologic_drugs = biologic_drugs.treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(
    doctor_state = doctor.loc_state
).doctor`: This line does the following:
   - It accesses the `treatments_used_in` subcollection of `biologic_drugs`, which is a list of treatments using these drugs.
   - It uses `.CALCULATE(doctor_state = doctor.loc_state)` to extract the doctor's state for each treatment.
   - Finally, it accesses the `doctor` subcollection to get the doctor information.

3. `distinct_states = PARTITION(
    doctors_with_biologic_drugs,
    name=""doctors"",
    by=doctor_state
).CALCULATE(doctor_state)`: This line uses PARTITION to group the doctors by their state, effectively finding the distinct states. The `.CALCULATE(doctor_state)` at the end ensures that only the distinct state values are returned.

4. `result = distinct_states`: This line assigns the distinct states to the result variable, which will be the output of the query.

This approach follows the document's advice to ""Always select the single most straightforward interpretation and implementation consistent with the provided context"" by directly filtering for biologic drugs and then extracting the distinct states of doctors who prescribe them.

## Code Explanation

1. **`treatments_2022 = Treatments.WHERE((YEAR(end_dt) == 2022))`**: This line filters the `Treatments` collection to only include treatments that ended in the year 2022.

2. **`outcomes_day100 = treatments_2022.outcome_records.WHERE(assess_dt == '2022-01-01').CALCULATE(...)`**: This line navigates to the outcome_records subcollection of the filtered treatments, filters for outcomes with an assessment date of '2022-01-01', and then selects only the treatment_id and day100_pasi_score.

3. **`patients_insurance = treatments_2022.CALCULATE(insurance_type=patient.ins_type)`**: This line calculates the insurance type for each treatment.

4. **`patients_insurance_summary = PARTITION(patients_insurance, name=""insurance_groups"", by=insurance_type).CALCULATE(...)`**: This line partitions the `patients_insurance` collection by insurance type and calculates the number of distinct patients for each insurance type.

5. **`pasi_summary = outcomes_day100.CALCULATE(avg_pasi_score=AVG(pasi_score_day100))`**: This line calculates the average PASI score at day 100 for the treatments filtered in the first step.

6. **`final_result = patients_insurance_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line combines the results from steps 4 and 5 to include both the number of distinct patients and the average PASI score per insurance type.

7. **`.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score.ASC())`**: Finally, this line sorts the results by average PASI score in ascending order and limits to the top 5 insurance types.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through the following transformations:

1. Start with `Treatments` collection
2. Filter to only include treatments that ended in 2022
3. Navigate to `outcome_records` subcollection and filter for assess_dt == '2022-01-01'
4. Select relevant fields (treatment_id, pasi_score_day100)
5. For each treatment in Treatments collection, calculates the insurance type of the patient
6. Groups these records by insurance type
7. Calculates the number of distinct patients for each insurance type
8. Calculates the average PASI score
9. Combines the results from insurance type counts and average PASI scores
10. Sorts by average PASI score in ascending order
11. Limits to the top 5 records

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The code demonstrates PyDough's strength in expressing hierarchical relationships by navigating from treatments to patient data and then grouping by insurance type.

2. **Incremental Transformation**: The code builds up the final result through several intermediate steps, each performing a specific transformation.

3. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Variables have descriptive names that clearly indicate what they represent.

4. **Proper Use of Aggregation**: The code correctly uses the `AVG` and `NDISTINCT` aggregation functions to calculate summaries across groups.

5. **Proper Use of PARTITION**: The code uses the `PARTITION` operation correctly to group data by insurance type.

6. **Appropriate Field Selection**: The code selects only the necessary fields at each step, avoiding unnecessary data retrieval.

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the original question by:

1. Focusing on treatments that ended in 2022 through the initial filter
2. Calculating the average PASI score at day 100 for these treatments
3. Counting the number of distinct patients per insurance type
4. Returning the top 5 insurance types with the lowest average PASI scores, which directly answers the question about insurance types with the best average outcome.",10.01775336265564,"treatments_2022 = Treatments.WHERE((YEAR(end_dt) == 2022))

**Explanation:**

1. **`doctors.CALCULATE(doc_id, first_name, last_name)`:** This part selects the `doctors` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to include only the `doc_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` fields in the result set. This effectively creates a collection with only these three fields for all doctors.

2. **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments)==1)`:** This part filters the collection to include only those doctors who have at least one treatment prescribed. The `HAS()` function checks if the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection has any records, which indicates that the doctor has prescribed treatments.

3. **`result = ...`:** The final assignment saves the resulting collection to the variable `result`.

**Explanation:**

1. We start with the `drugs` collection, which contains information about all drugs in the database.

2. We use `CALCULATE(drug_id, drug_name)` to select only the drug_id and drug_name fields, which are the fields specifically requested in the prompt.

3. We use `WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_used_in))` to filter the drugs. The `HASNOT` function checks if the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection (which represents all treatments that use the drug) is empty. Only drugs with an empty `treatments_used_in` collection (i.e., drugs not used in any treatments) will pass this filter.

This approach is efficient and directly answers the question by filtering drugs based on whether they have any associated treatments.",2.5411040782928467,"result = drugs.CALCULATE(drug_id, drug_name).WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_used_in))","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=208 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=208)] prompt_token_count=19323 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19323)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=19531 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

1. **Analysis of the request:**
   - We need to identify patients who haven't received any treatments.
   - We need to return specific fields: patient_id, first_name, and last_name.
   - We can use the HASNOT function to check if a patient has any treatments.
   
2. **Logical step-by-step explanation:**
   - Start with the Patients collection.
   - Filter the patients to include only those who haven't received any treatments using the HASNOT function.
   - Calculate the desired fields (patient_id, first_name, last_name) using the CALCULATE function.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block:**

```python
patients_no_treatments = Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1).CALCULATE(
    patient_id=patient_id,
    first_name=first_name,
    last_name=last_name
)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - `Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1)`: This part starts with the Patients collection and filters it to include only patients who have no treatments associated with them. The HASNOT function returns 1 if the collection (treatments_received) is empty and 0 otherwise.
   - `.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`: This part selects and renames the desired fields (patient_id, first_name, last_name) from the filtered collection.

5. **PyDough-specific functions and patterns used:**
   - **HASNOT**: This function is used to check if a collection is empty. In this case, it's checking if a patient has any treatments_received.
   - **CALCULATE**: This function is used to select and optionally rename fields in a collection.
   - **WHERE**: This function is used to filter records based on a condition.
   - **Collection Access**: The code accesses the Patients collection and its attributes (patient_id, first_name, last_name, treatments_received).

6. **Data flow and transformations:**
   - The code starts with the Patients collection, which contains all patients records.
   - It filters this collection using the WHERE function to keep only patients who haven't received any treatments.
   - It then uses CALCULATE to select the desired fields (patient_id, first_name, last_name).
   - The result is a new collection with only the specified fields for patients who have no treatments.

7. **How this code addresses the original question:**
   The original question asks for patient IDs, first names, and last names of patients who haven't received any treatments. The code directly addresses this by:

What are the top 2 specialties by number of doctors? Return the specialty and number of doctors.,"SELECT specialty, COUNT(*) AS num_doctors FROM doctors GROUP BY specialty ORDER BY CASE WHEN num_doctors IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END DESC, num_doctors DESC LIMIT 2;",DermTreatment,"# Step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code

## Analysis of the question
The question asks for the top 2 specialties based on the number of doctors in each specialty. This requires counting doctors by specialty and then selecting the top 2.

## Relevant PyDough functions and patterns used
1. `PARTITION`: Used to group records by a specific field (in this case, doctor specialty) [8ad0b9f].
2. `CALCULATE`: Used to define new fields or select fields from a collection [52758c5].
3. `COUNT`: Used to count the number of records in a collection [de9224a].
4. `TOP_K`: Used to select the top K records based on a sorting criterion [8ad0b9f].
5. `.DESC()`: Used to sort in descending order [8ad0b9f].

## How the code addresses the question
The code follows a logical sequence to answer the question:
1. Groups doctors by their specialty using `PARTITION`.
2. For each specialty group, counts the number of doctors using `COUNT`.
3. Selects the top 2 specialties based on the doctor count using `TOP_K` and `.DESC()` for descending order.
4. Returns the specialty and the count of doctors.

## Data flow and transformations
The data flow in the code is as follows:
1. Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2. Group doctors by their specialty using `PARTITION(Doctors, name=""specialties"", by=speciality)`.
3. Calculate the count of doctors for each specialty group using `CALCULATE(specialty, num_doctors=COUNT(Doctors))`.
4. Select the top 2 specialties with the highest doctor count using `TOP_K(2, by=num_doctors.DESC())`.
5. Store the final result in the `specialty_counts` variable.

## PyDough-specific best practices demonstrated
1. **Using PARTITION for grouping**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group doctors by their specialty, which is the standard way to perform grouping operations in PyDough [8ad0b9f].
2. **Appropriate use of aggregation functions**: The code uses `COUNT` to count the number of doctors in each specialty group, which is an appropriate aggregation function for this purpose [de9224a].
3. **Using TOP_K for selecting top records**: The code uses `TOP_K` with `.DESC()` to select the top 2 specialties, which is the standard way to select top records in PyDough [8ad0b9f].
4. **Meaningful variable naming**: The variable names (`Doctors`, `specialty`, `num_doctors`, `specialty_counts`) are descriptive and indicate what they contain.
5. **Logical code structure**: The code follows a clear, logical flow that makes it easy to understand the steps being performed.

## How this code follows PyDough conventions
1. **Collection access**: The code correctly accesses the `Doctors` collection to start the query.
2. **PARTITION syntax**: The code follows the correct syntax for using the `PARTITION` function [8ad0b9f].
3. **CALCULATE syntax**: The code uses the correct syntax for the `CALCULATE` function to define new fields [52758c5].
4. **TOP_K syntax**: The code uses the correct syntax for the `TOP_K` function with the `by` parameter and `.DESC()` modifier for descending order [8ad0b9f].
5. **Aggregation**: The code properly uses the `COUNT` function as an aggregation operation [de9224a].

## How the code could be improved
1. **Error handling**: The code could be improved by adding error handling to handle cases where there might be no doctors or invalid data.
2. **Clarity in variable naming**: While the variable names are descriptive, they could be slightly more specific (e.g., `Doctors_grouped_by_specialty` instead of `specialties`).
3. **Modularity**: The code could be broken down into smaller functions for better readability and reusability.

## Similar examples from the search results
From [8ad0b9f], there's a similar example:
```python
regions.CALCULATE(
    region_name = name,
    n_nations = COUNT(nations)
).TOP_K(2, by=n_nations.DESC())
```
This example also uses `CALCULATE`, `COUNT`, and `TOP_K` to find the top regions with the most nations.

Another similar example from [8ad0b9f]:
```python
nations.CALCULATE(nation_name = name).TOP_K(5, by=nation_name.ASC())
```
This shows a basic use of `TOP_K` with a sorting criterion.

## Conclusion
The provided PyDough code efficiently answers the question by using `PARTITION` to group doctors by specialty, `COUNT` to count the number of doctors in each specialty, and `TOP_K` with `.DESC()` to select the top 2 specialties with the highest doctor count. The code follows PyDough conventions and best practices, making it a clear and effective solution to the problem.",8.695514678955078,"nations.CALCULATE(nation_name = name).TOP_K(5, by=nation_name.ASC())","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1127 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=1127)] prompt_token_count=19326 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19326)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=20453 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

).ORDER_BY(max_itch_vas.DESC()).TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_vas.DESC())
```

Code Context:
1. **Collection Selection**: The code starts with the `Diagnoses` collection, which contains information about different diagnoses.

2. **Field Calculation**:
   - `diag_name=diag_name`: Selects the diagnosis name.
   - `num_patients=COUNT(treatments_for.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id))`: Counts the number of distinct patients associated with each diagnosis. It accesses the `treatments_for` sub-collection (which is the list of treatments related to each diagnosis) and then accesses the `patient_id` field of each treatment record. The `.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id)` part ensures that the patient IDs are selected for counting.
   - `max_itch_vas=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.CALCULATE(day100_itch_vas=day100_itch_vas).day100_itch_vas)`: Finds the maximum itch VAS score at day 100 for each diagnosis. It accesses the `treatments_for` sub-collection (which is the list of treatments related to each diagnosis), then accesses the `outcome_records` sub-collection of each treatment to get the `day100_itch_vas` score.

3. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the maximum itch VAS score in descending order using `.ORDER_BY(max_itch_vas.DESC())`.

4. **Top-K Selection**: Finally, `.TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_vas.DESC())` selects the top 3 diagnoses based on the maximum itch VAS score.

Data Flow:
The data flow is as follows:
1. Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2. For each diagnosis, calculate the diagnosis name, the number of distinct patients who received treatments for that diagnosis, and the maximum itch VAS score at day 100.
3. Order the diagnoses by the maximum itch VAS score in descending order.
4. Select the top 3 diagnoses.
5. The result will contain the diagnosis name, the number of patients, and the maximum itch score for the top 3 diagnoses with the highest maximum itch VAS score at day 100.

PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated:
1. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The code demonstrates hierarchical thinking by navigating from diagnoses to treatments to outcomes.

2. **Aggregation Functions**: It uses aggregation functions like `COUNT` and `MAX` to summarize data from sub-collections.

3. **Clear Naming**: The code uses clear and descriptive variable names (e.g., `diag_name`, `num_patients`, `max_itch_vas`).

4. **Chaining Operations**: The code chains operations in a logical sequence (CALCULATE → ORDER_BY → TOP_K).

5. **Appropriate Data Transformations**: The `.CALCULATE()` operations are used to transform and extract the required data before aggregation.

How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions:
1. **Capitalized Function Names**: The code uses capitalized function names (e.g., `COUNT`, `MAX`, `ORDER_BY`, `TOP_K`) following PyDough's convention for built-in functions.

2. **Collection-First Approach**: The code follows the collection-first approach where operations are chained after starting with a collection.

3. **Descriptive Field Names**: The code uses descriptive field names in the CALCULATE operations, making it easy to understand what data is being extracted.

4. **Proper Sorting and Limiting**: The code uses ORDER_BY with a descending sort and TOP_K to limit the results, which is the standard way to get a ranked subset of data in PyDough.

How the Code Addresses the Original Question:
The original question asks for the top 3 diagnoses by maximum itch VAS score at day 100 and number of distinct patients. The code addresses this by:
1. Calculating the maximum itch VAS score at day 100 for each diagnosis.
2. Counting the number of distinct patients associated with each diagnosis.
3. Selecting the top 3 diagnoses based on the maximum itch VAS score.
4. Returning the diagnosis name, number of patients, and maximum itch score as requested.

- We need to find the top 3 doctor specialties based on the total drug amount prescribed.
- We only consider treatments that started in the past 6 calendar months.
- We need to return the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount.

The data flow will be:
1. Filter treatments to only those that started in the past 6 months
2. Group treatments by doctor specialty
3. Calculate the number of treatments and total drug amount for each specialty
4. Order the results by total drug amount in descending order
5. Take the top 3

Now, let's write the PyDough code:

)

# Order the results by total drug amount in descending order and take the top 3
result = specialty_metrics.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())
```

Explanation of how the code works:

2. `recent_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(start_dt >= six_months_ago)`: Filters the Treatments collection to only include treatments that started in the past 6 months.
3. `specialty_groups = PARTITION(recent_treatments.CALCULATE(doctor_specialty=doctor.speciality), name=""specialties"", by=doctor_specialty)`: Groups the filtered treatments by doctor specialty.
4. `specialty_metrics = specialty_groups.CALCULATE(specialty=doctor_specialty, num_treatments=COUNT(specialties), total_drug_amount=SUM(specialties.tot_drug_amt))`: Calculates the number of treatments and total drug amount for each specialty.

"What are the top 3 insurance types by average patient height in cm? Return the insurance type, average height and average weight.","SELECT ins_type, AVG(height_cm) AS avg_height, AVG(weight_kg) AS avg_weight FROM patients GROUP BY ins_type ORDER BY CASE WHEN avg_height IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END DESC, avg_height DESC LIMIT 3;",DermTreatment,"1. **Analysis of the question:**
   The question asks for the top 3 insurance types with the highest average patient height in centimeters. For each of these insurance types, it also requires the average height and average weight of patients with that insurance type. This involves grouping patients by insurance type, calculating the average height for each group, and then selecting the top 3 based on average height. We also need to calculate the average weight for each insurance type group.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   a. Partition the Patients collection by insurance type.
   b. Calculate the average height and average weight for each insurance type partition.
   c. Use TOP_K to select the top 3 insurance types based on average height.

3. **The PyDough code:**
   ```python
   insurance_types = Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=ins_type).CALCULATE(
       ins_type=ins_type,
       avg_height=AVG(insurance_groups.height_cm),
       avg_weight=AVG(insurance_groups.weight_kg)
   ).TOP_K(3, by=avg_height.DESC())
   ```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   a. `Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=ins_type)`: This partitions the Patients collection by the ins_type field, grouping all patients with the same insurance type together. The partitioned collection is named ""insurance_groups"".

   b. `.CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the following fields for each insurance type group:
      - `ins_type=ins_type`: The insurance type itself.
      - `avg_height=AVG(insurance_groups.height_cm)`: The average height of all patients in that insurance type group.
      - `avg_weight=AVG(insurance_groups.weight_kg)`: The average weight of all patients in that insurance type group.

   c. `.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 insurance types based on the descending order of their average height, effectively returning the 3 insurance types with the highest average patient height.

5. **How this code addresses the original question:**
   The code directly addresses the question by:
   - Grouping patients by insurance type
   - Calculating the average height and weight for each group
   - Selecting the top 3 insurance types with the highest average height
   - Returning the insurance type, average height, and average weight for these top 3 types

The result will be a collection containing 3 records, each representing one of the top 3 insurance types, with the average height and average weight of patients with that insurance type.

I'll add a comment block with the relevant information and search terms as described in the documentation:

# Key Information and Search Terms for PyDough Query

## Query Analysis

The PyDough code answers the question ""What are the top 3 insurance types by average patient height in cm? Return the insurance type, average height, and average weight.""

## PyDough-Specific Patterns and Functions Used

### PARTITION Operation
The code uses the `PARTITION` operation to group patient records by insurance type [51b4e9f]. According to the documentation, ""The purpose of the `PARTITION` operation is to group the records in a collection into a logical partition scheme, then be able to perform aggregations and calculations on this grouped data.""

The syntax follows the pattern `PARTITION(collection, name=""..."", by=(field1, field2, ...))`, where:
- `collection` is the data source to be partitioned (here, `Patients`)
- `name` is the string that corresponds to the name by which the partitioned data is referred to
- `by` is a 1+ tuple of values that define the partitioning scheme [0e9960d]

### AVG Function
The code uses the `AVG` function to calculate the average height and weight for each insurance group [0e9960d]. Per the documentation, this is one of several aggregation functions supported by PyDough, along with `SUM`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `MEDIAN`.

### TOP_K Operation
The code uses the `TOP_K` operation to select the top 3 insurance types by average height [0e9960d]. This operation takes two parameters:
- `k`: The number of top records to select (here, 3)
- `by`: An expression that the records should be sorted by, with `.DESC()` indicating descending order

### DESC Suffix
The `.DESC()` suffix is used with the sorting expression to indicate descending order [0e9960d]. This is a standard PyDough pattern for specifying sort direction.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through several transformation steps:

1. Start with the `Patients` collection
2. Group these records by insurance type using `PARTITION`
3. For each insurance type group, calculate:
   - The insurance type itself
   - The average height of patients with that insurance
   - The average weight of patients with that insurance
4. Select the top 3 insurance types with the highest average height
5. Return the insurance type, average height, and average weight for these top types

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Using PARTITION for Aggregation**: As described in the documentation, PARTITION is the correct way to group data before performing calculations on those groups [0e9960d].

2. **Clear Variable Names**: The code uses descriptive variable names like `insurance_types` and `insurance_groups` that clearly indicate what each collection represents [0e9960d].

3. **Chaining Operations**: The code chains operations in a logical sequence (PARTITION → CALCULATE → TOP_K) which makes the code more readable [0e9960d].

4. **Using Appropriate Aggregation Functions**: The code uses `AVG` which is the appropriate aggregation function for calculating averages [0e9960d].

5. **Using Descending Order for Sorting**: The code correctly uses `.DESC()` to sort by average height in descending order, which is necessary to find the top 3 values [0e9960d].

## How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using the standard pattern of accessing collections (`Patients`) and their properties
2. Using the correct syntax for PARTITION (`PARTITION(collection, name=""..."", by=(field1, field2, ...))`)
3. Using the correct syntax for TOP_K (`TOP_K(k, by=expression.DESC())`)
4. Following the pattern of naming partitioned data (`name=""insurance_groups""`)
5. Using descriptive variable names that clearly indicate what they represent
6. Using proper capitalization for PyDough keywords (PARTITION, CALCULATE, AVG, TOP_K, DESC)

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""the top 3 insurance types by average patient height in cm"" and to return ""the insurance type, average height, and average weight.""

The code addresses this by:

1. Grouping patients by insurance type
2. Calculating the average height and weight for each insurance type
3. Sorting these groups by average height in descending order
4. Selecting the top 3 with the highest average height
5. Returning exactly the requested fields: insurance type, average height, and average weight

This provides a direct answer to the question that is both accurate and easy to understand.

## Similar Examples from Documentation

        depts.employees,
        2,
        by=salary.DESC(),
    )
)
```

This example also uses PARTITION to group data, then calculates values within each group, and finally uses TOP_K to select a subset of the results based on a sorting criterion.",13.164145469665527,"depts = PARTITION(

1. **Analysis of the question**: The question asks for the top 5 drugs based on two criteria: the number of treatments they are used in, and the average drug amount per treatment. This requires counting the number of treatments each drug is used in, calculating the average drug amount per treatment, and then ranking the drugs based on these criteria.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**:
   - First, we start with the `Drugs` collection and calculate the number of treatments each drug is used in and the average drug amount per treatment.
   - Then, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 drugs based on the number of treatments.
   - Finally, we select the drug name, number of treatments, and average drug amount.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**:
```python
drug_stats = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    drug_name=drug_name,
    num_treatments=COUNT(treatments_used_in),
    avg_drug_amount=AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)
).TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())

result = drug_stats.CALCULATE(
    drug_name=drug_name,
    num_treatments=num_treatments,
    avg_drug_amount=avg_drug_amount
)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**:
   - The `drug_stats` variable calculates the drug name, number of treatments, and average drug amount for each drug in the `Drugs` collection. It then uses `TOP_K` to select the top 5 drugs based on the number of treatments.
   - The `result` variable selects the drug name, number of treatments, and average drug amount from the `drug_stats` collection, ensuring that only the requested information is returned.
   - This approach uses a two-step process to first calculate the necessary statistics and then select the desired information, which is more efficient than trying to do everything in one step.

Pydough Code:
drug_stats = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    drug_name=drug_name,
    num_treatments=COUNT(treatments_used_in),
    avg_drug_amount=AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)
).TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())

result = drug_stats.CALCULATE(
    drug_name=drug_name,
    num_treatments=num_treatments,
    avg_drug_amount=avg_drug_amount
)

Code Context:
# Explanation of PyDough Code for Top 5 Drugs

The provided PyDough code answers the question: ""What are the top 5 drugs by number of treatments and average drug amount per treatment? Return the drug name, number of treatments, and average drug amount.""

## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### CALCULATE
The code uses `CALCULATE` [cba3a29] to:
- Create new fields (`drug_name`, `num_treatments`, `avg_drug_amount`)
- Select specific fields for output

This is a core PyDough operation that allows for deriving new values and choosing which data to include in the result set.

### COUNT
The code uses `COUNT(treatments_used_in)` [a4c711b] to count the number of treatments each drug is used in. COUNT is an aggregation function that counts non-null records in a collection.

### AVG
The code uses `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)` [a4c711b] to calculate the average drug amount across all treatments for each drug. AVG is another aggregation function that computes the average value.

### TOP_K
The code uses `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())` [db01e4d] to select the top 5 drugs based on the number of treatments in descending order. TOP_K is a sorting operation that limits the result to the top K records based on a specified ordering.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow pattern:

1. Start with the `Drugs` collection
2. Apply `CALCULATE` to create new fields:
   - `drug_name` takes the name directly from the drug record
   - `num_treatments` counts how many treatments each drug is used in
   - `avg_drug_amount` calculates the average amount used per treatment
3. Use `TOP_K` to select only the top 5 drugs with the highest number of treatments
4. Apply another `CALCULATE` to select just the fields needed for the output
5. Store the result in the variable `result`

This pattern of chaining operations is common in PyDough and allows for building complex queries through composable steps.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Meaningful variable names**: Variables like `drug_stats` and `result` clearly indicate their purpose [1f99e99]

2. **Stepwise transformation**: The code builds the query in logical steps, first creating statistics, then selecting top results, then formatting the output [0593c89]

3. **Field selection**: The code uses `CALCULATE` twice to ensure only needed fields are returned, which is more efficient than returning all fields [db01e4d]

4. **Proper aggregation usage**: Aggregation functions like COUNT and AVG are used with proper context (applied to sub-collections) [a4c711b]

5. **Clear data flow**: The code follows a logical sequence of operations that are easy to understand [8ad213e]

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using proper method chaining syntax (`collection.method().method()...`) [db01e4d]

2. Using uppercase for PyDough operations (CALCULATE, COUNT, AVG, TOP_K) [cba3a29]

3. Following the proper TOP_K syntax with a count and ordering expression [db01e4d]

4. Using descriptive variable names that match their content [1f99e99]

5. Using parentheses around conditions and expressions where needed [a581294]

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly answers the question by:

1. Identifying the top 5 drugs based on number of treatments (COUNT(treatments_used_in))
2. Calculating the average drug amount per treatment (AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt))
3. Returning only the requested fields (drug_name, num_treatments, avg_drug_amount)
4. Storing the final result in a variable called `result`

The code is efficient because it first identifies the top drugs based on treatment count, then calculates the average amount only for those top drugs.

## Key Examples from Search Results

A similar example from the search results shows how to find top customers by average order quantity:

```python
cust_order_quantities = GRAPH.customers.CALCULATE(
  custkey,
  average_quantity = AVG(orders.lineitems.quantity)
)

result = TOP_K(
  cust_order_quantities,
  3,
  by=(average_quantity.DESC(), custkey.ASC())
)
```

This example [0593c89] demonstrates a similar pattern of calculating aggregates and then selecting top results based on those aggregates.

Another relevant example [8ad213e] shows how to count orders per customer:

```python
customers.CALCULATE(
  customer_key = custkey,
  name = name,
  num_orders = COUNT(orders)
)
```

Both examples follow the same pattern of using aggregation functions (AVG, COUNT) and sorting with TOP_K as seen in the drug code.",13.17135214805603,"customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**
1. First, we calculate the date 6 months ago from today.

    first_treatment_date=MIN(prescribed_treatments.start_dt),
    first_treatment_id=MIN(prescribed_treatments._id)
)
result = doctors_2years_ago
```

Code Explanation:
1. Calculate the year two years ago from the current year using `YEAR(NOW()) - 2` and store it in `two_years_ago`.
2. Filter the `Doctors` collection to only include doctors whose `year_reg` matches the calculated `two_years_ago`.
3. Calculate the requested fields for each filtered doctor:
   - `last_name`: The last name of the doctor.
   - `year_reg`: The registration year of the doctor.
   - `first_treatment_date`: The minimum start date of all treatments prescribed by the doctor, effectively giving the date of their first treatment.
   - `first_treatment_id`: The minimum _id of all treatments prescribed by the doctor, effectively giving the id of their first treatment.
4. Store the result in the `result` variable.

Relevant PyDough functions and patterns used:
- `YEAR(NOW())`: Gets the current year.
- `Doctors.WHERE(condition)`: Filters the `Doctors` collection based on a condition.
- `.CALCULATE(field1=value1, field2=value2, ...)`: Selects and calculates specified fields from a collection.
- `MIN(collection.field)`: Returns the minimum value of a field across all records in a collection.
- Collection traversal: Uses dot notation to navigate from `Doctors` to `prescribed_treatments`.

Data flow:
1. Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2. Filter to include only doctors registered two years ago.
3. For each doctor, calculate the last name, year of registration, minimum start date of treatments, and minimum _id of treatments.
4. The final result contains these calculated fields for each doctor who meets the filter criteria.

PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated:
1. Storing intermediate calculations in variables for readability and reuse (`two_years_ago`).
2. Using descriptive variable names (`doctors_2years_ago`).
3. Breaking down the problem into logical steps (filter then calculate).
4. Using aggregation functions (`MIN`) to get specific values across a collection.
5. Directly addressing the question by returning only the requested fields.

How this code follows PyDough conventions:
1. Uses the correct filtering syntax with `WHERE(condition)`.
2. Uses the correct field selection syntax with `.CALCULATE()`.
3. Properly calculates the derived field `first_treatment_date` using the `MIN` function on a collection.
4. Follows the pattern of accessing related data through dot notation (`prescribed_treatments.start_dt`).

How the code addresses the original question:
The original question asks for the last name, year of registration, and first treatment (date and _id) for doctors registered two years ago. The code directly addresses this by:
1. Filtering doctors to only include those registered two years ago.
2. Retrieving the last name and year of registration directly.
3. Using the minimum start date and _id of treatments to get the date and id of the first treatment.
4. Returning all requested information in a single result set.

If there were multiple fields that you would consider to be a doctor's first treatment id, you could partition doctors by their registration year and then calculate both their first treatment date and their first treatment id, as such:
```python

1. We start with the `Treatments` collection and calculate the `treatment_id` and `start_date` using `CALCULATE`.

2. We then access the `adverse_events` subcollection and filter for adverse events that occurred within 10 days after the treatment start date using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_date, reported_dt) <= 10`.

3. Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields (`treatment_id`, `treatment_start_date`, `adverse_event_date`, and `adverse_event_description`) for the results.

This code follows the PyDough syntax conventions demonstrated in the documentation and examples provided, using dot notation to navigate from treatments to adverse events, and using `CALCULATE` and `WHERE` to filter and select the desired data.",3.9641785621643066,"treatments_with_adverse_events = Treatments.CALCULATE(

Next, I need to filter the `placebo_treatments` to include only those where there are concomitant medications that were started within 2 weeks (14 days) of the treatment start date. I can use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the start dates.
```python
treatment_info = placebo_treatments.CALCULATE(

Finally, I need to select the required fields from both the treatment and the concomitant medications.
```python

### Explanation:
1. First, we filter treatments to only include those where `is_placebo` is True.
2. Then, we calculate the treatment details (id, start date, end date) along with details of concomitant medications.
3. We filter to include only those treatments where at least one concomitant medication was started within 14 days of the treatment start date.
4. Finally, we select the desired fields from the filtered treatments and their concomitant medications.

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To answer the question about the average age of registered male patients with private insurance, I'll create a PyDough query that filters the Patients collection for male patients with private insurance, calculates their ages based on their birth dates, and then computes the average age.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Filter Patients**: Start with the Patients collection and filter for male patients with private insurance using the WHERE clause.
2. **Calculate Age**: Use the `YEAR(date_of_birth)` function to extract the birth year and `YEAR(NOW())` to get the current year. Subtract the birth year from the current year to calculate the age.
3. **Compute Average Age**: Use the AVG aggregation function to compute the average age of the filtered patients.

And here's the PyDough code:

```python
male_private_insurance = Patients.WHERE(
    (gender == 'M') & (ins_type == 'Private')
).CALCULATE(
    age=YEAR(NOW()) - YEAR(date_of_birth)
)

result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    average_age=AVG(male_private_insurance.age)
)
```

Explanation:

1. The first part of the query (`male_private_insurance`) filters the Patients collection for male patients with private insurance and calculates their ages. It filters records where the gender field equals 'M' and the insurance type field equals 'Private'. Then, it calculates the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.

2. The second part (`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`) computes the average age of these filtered patients using the AVG aggregation function. The result variable will contain the average age of male patients with private insurance.

I chose this approach because it follows the PyDough conventions for filtering and calculating data. The WHERE clause is used to filter records, and the CALCULATE function is used to compute new fields. The AVG function is used for aggregation, and the final result is assigned to the `result` variable.",3.917177438735962,"male_private_insurance = Patients.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1. **`merchant_coupon_data` Calculation**: This block calculates the necessary metrics for each merchant:
   - `merchant_name=name`: Gets the name of the merchant.
   - `successful_transactions=transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""success"")`: Filters transactions to include only successful ones.
   - `coupons_used=COUNT(DISTINCT successful_transactions.coupon_id)`: Counts the number of distinct coupons used in successful transactions.
   - `total_transactions=COUNT(DISTINCT successful_transactions.txid)`: Counts the total number of successful transactions.

2. **`result` Calculation**: This block calculates the coupon usage rate (CPUR) for each merchant:
   - It uses the `IFF` function to handle the case where a merchant has no transactions (to avoid division by zero).
   - If `total_transactions > 0`, it calculates `coupons_used / total_transactions` to get the CPUR.
   - If `total_transactions` is zero, it sets the CPUR to 0.

This approach directly addresses the prompt by first filtering transactions to include only successful ones, then calculating the number of distinct coupons used and the total number of distinct transactions, and finally computing the CPUR by dividing the former by the latter, handling the edge case of zero transactions.",4.180969953536987,"merchant_coupon_data = Merchants.CALCULATE(

## Analysis of the Question

The question asks to count active retail merchants who have issued coupons and return their names and the total number of coupons issued. The question also specifies that merchant categories should be matched case-insensitively.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2. Filter for merchants with the `category` field containing 'retail' (case-insensitive comparison).
3. Filter for active merchants (status = 'active').
4. Calculate the number of coupons issued by each filtered merchant.
5. Include the merchant name in the result.

## The PyDough Code

```python
retail_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(
  CONTAINS(LOWER(category), 'retail')
).WHERE(
  status == 'active'
).CALCULATE(
  merchant_name=name,
  num_coupons=COUNT(coupons)
)
```

## Explanation of How the Code Works

1. `Merchants.WHERE(CONTAINS(LOWER(category), 'retail'))`: This part filters the `Merchants` collection to only include merchants whose category contains 'retail' (case-insensitive comparison). It uses the `CONTAINS` function to check if 'retail' exists as a substring in the lowercased version of the category, ensuring case-insensitivity.

2. `.WHERE(status == 'active')`: This further filters the result to only include active merchants.

3. `.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, num_coupons=COUNT(coupons))`: This part calculates the number of coupons issued by each merchant and includes the merchant name in the result. It uses the `COUNT` function on the `coupons` subcollection to count the number of coupons issued by each merchant.

4. The result is stored in the `retail_merchants` variable, which contains the merchant name and the number of coupons they've issued.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Case-Insensitive Comparison**: Using `LOWER(category)` with `CONTAINS` ensures a case-insensitive comparison, which is important when dealing with potentially mixed-case data.

2. **Chaining Operations**: The code chains multiple operations (`WHERE` and `CALCULATE`) for a more concise and readable expression.

3. **Meaningful Variable Names**: The variable name `retail_merchants` clearly indicates what data it contains.

4. **Descriptive Column Names**: The code uses descriptive column names (`merchant_name` and `num_coupons`) that clearly indicate what each column represents.

5. **Filtering Before Calculation**: The code filters the data before performing calculations, which can improve efficiency by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

This code demonstrates how PyDough can be used to efficiently answer analytical questions by leveraging its hierarchical data model and built-in functions like `CONTAINS`, `LOWER`, and `COUNT`.",5.100909948348999,"retail_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(

1. Filter users to only include those from the US
2. Filter transactions to only include those made in the last 7 days (including today)
3. Count the number of transactions
4. Calculate the total transaction amount
5. Return both the count and the total amount

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta

today = date.today()
seven_days_ago = today - timedelta(days=7)

us_users = Users.WHERE(country == ""USA"")
transactions_last_7_days = Transactions.WHERE((created_at >= seven_days_ago) & (created_at <= today))

```

Explanation:
1. We import the necessary date and timedelta functions.
2. We define today's date and calculate the date 7 days ago.
3. We filter the Users collection to only include those from the US.
4. We filter the Transactions collection to only include those created in the last 7 days.
5. We use the CALCULATE function on the US users to:
   - Count the total number of transactions (both sent and received)
   - Calculate the total transaction amount (both sent and received)
   - The transaction amount is converted to USD by multiplying with the `usd_exchange_rate` and filtering only USD transactions.

Pydough Code:
```python

Based on the documentation and examples provided, I can explain how the following PyDough code answers the question ""What is the LUB for each user. LUB = Latest User Balance, which is the most recent balance for each user"":

```python
user_balances = Users.CALCULATE(username=username, all_balances=balances).CALCULATE(latest_balance=TOP_K(all_balances, 1, by=updated_at.DESC()).SINGULAR())
```

## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### CALCULATE
The `CALCULATE` function is used twice in this code [2ba95e7]. It allows you to create new fields, rename existing ones, or select specific fields from a collection. As shown in the documentation, you can chain `CALCULATE` calls to perform multiple transformations [2ba95e7].

### TOP_K
The `TOP_K` function selects the top `k` records based on a specified ordering criterion [f9b2329]. In this code, it's used to select the single most recent balance for each user. The syntax follows the pattern shown in the examples:

```python
collection.TOP_K(k, by=field.DESC())
```

Where `k` is the number of records to select, and `field` is the field used for sorting in descending order (`DESC`) to get the most recent value [f9b2329].

### SINGULAR
The `SINGULAR` function ensures that a plural collection (one with multiple records) is treated as a singular record [0e9c9b6]. This is necessary because `TOP_K` returns a collection, and we need a single balance value for each user. As the documentation states:

""SINGULAR in PyDough ensures data is explicitly treated as singular in sub-collection contexts, preventing undefined behavior if used correctly"" [0e9c9b6].

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows this logical flow:

1. Start with the `Users` collection, which contains user records
2. Use the first `CALCULATE` to select the `username` field and create a new field called `all_balances` that references the user's list of balances [2ba95e7]
3. Use the second `CALCULATE` to:
   - Apply `TOP_K(all_balances, 1, by=updated_at.DESC())` to sort all balances by update time in descending order and select only the first (most recent) record [f9b2329]
   - Apply `.SINGULAR()` to convert this collection with one record to a single value [0e9c9b6]
   - Assign this single value to a new field called `latest_balance`
4. The final result is a collection where each user has their username and their most recent balance

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several best practices:

1. **Chaining operations**: The code chains two `CALCULATE` operations, which is a common pattern in PyDough to break down transformations into logical steps [2ba95e7].

2. **Using meaningful field names**: The code uses descriptive field names like `latest_balance` and `all_balances` that clearly indicate what each field represents.

3. **Proper use of SINGULAR**: The code correctly uses `SINGULAR` after applying `TOP_K` to convert a collection to a singular value, as required when accessing properties that should be singular [0e9c9b6].

4. **Hierarchical thinking**: The code demonstrates how PyDough uses hierarchical document model thinking to access related collections (users → balances) and transform data at different levels [988171e].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using proper function names (CALCULATE, TOP_K, SINGULAR)
2. Using the proper syntax for TOP_K with the required `by` parameter [f9b2329]
3. Using the proper syntax for DESC ordering [f9b2329]
4. Using dot notation to navigate from users to their balances
5. Using chaining to build complex transformations step by step [2ba95e7]
6. Properly using SINGULAR to convert a collection to a singular value [0e9c9b6]

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""the LUB for each user."" This code directly addresses that by:

1. Identifying each user from the `Users` collection
2. Accessing all balances associated with each user
3. Selecting the most recent balance for each user (based on `updated_at` timestamp)
4. Returning this latest balance alongside the user's username

The result is exactly what was requested: for each user, their latest balance value (which is their LUB).

## Comparison to Examples in the Documentation

This code is similar to examples in the documentation that show how to select the top K records with specific ordering, and how to use SINGULAR to access single values from related collections. For example:

From [f9b2329]:
```python
customers.CALCULATE(cust_name=name).TOP_K(10, by=COUNT(orders).DESC())
```

From [0e9c9b6]:
```python

    year_1997=region_order_values_1997.SINGULAR().total_order_value
)
```

The question asks for each user's marketing opt-in preference, which is stored in the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection as a boolean value (`marketing_opt_in`). We need to:

1. Access the latest snapshot for each user.
2. For each of these snapshots, return the user ID and the marketing opt-in value.

    user_id,
    marketing_opt_in=SINGULAR(users.marketing_opt_in)
)
```

# Explanation of Code

1. **Access Users and their Settings**: The code starts by accessing the `Users` collection and selecting each user's ID (`uid`) and their `setting_snapshots` sub-collection. This collection contains all settings snapshots for each user.
2. **Order Settings by Date**: For each user's settings snapshots, the code orders them by the `snapshot_date` in descending order (newest first). This ensures that the first record will always be the latest snapshot.
3. **Handle Missing Settings**: The code uses `DEFAULT_TO(SINGULAR(latest_settings.marketing_opt_in), False)` to handle cases where a user might not have any settings snapshots. If no snapshot exists, `DEFAULT_TO` returns `False` for the marketing opt-in value.
4. **Partition and Select Marketing Opt-in**: The code then partitions the results by `user_id` and uses `SINGULAR(users.marketing_opt_in)` to get the marketing opt-in value from the latest snapshot.

# PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Using Appropriate Functions**: The code uses `SINGULAR` to handle the sub-collection relationship and ensure only one value is returned per user. It uses `DEFAULT_TO` to handle null cases and provide a default value.
2. **Proper Hierarchical Thinking**: The code follows a clear hierarchical data flow, starting from users, accessing their settings, and extracting the specific data needed.
3. **Effective Use of Partitioning**: The code uses `PARTITION` to group the results by user ID, which is necessary for collecting the marketing opt-in value from the latest snapshot for each user.

# How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using the correct syntax for accessing collections and sub-collections.
2. Using appropriate functions like `SINGULAR` and `DEFAULT_TO` to handle data relationships and null values.
3. Following the proper structure for creating queries with `CALCULATE` and `ORDER_BY`.
4. Using `PARTITION` with the required `name` and `by` parameters.

1. We start with the Merchants collection and use CALCULATE to create a new collection merchant_revenue with each merchant's name, category, and total revenue from successfully received transactions (receiver_type == 1).
2. We then use CALCULATE again on the merchant_revenue collection to add a revenue_rank field, using the RANKING function to rank merchants by their revenue in descending order.
3. Finally, we use CALCULATE one more time to select the fields we want to return: merchant_name, category, revenue, and revenue_rank.

### Explanation:

1. **Calculate Start and End Dates**:
   - The code calculates the start and end dates for the 2-month period excluding the current month. `end_date` is set to the last day of the previous month, and `start_date` is set to the first day of 2 months prior.

2. **Filter Wallet Transactions**:
   - The code filters transactions to include only those within the specified date range (`start_date` to `end_date`). It also extracts the month, year, and sender ID from each transaction.

3. **Calculate Distinct Senders per Month**:
   - Transactions are partitioned by year and month to group transactions by month.
   - For each month, the code calculates the distinct count of senders.

4. **Calculate Average Daily Active Users per Month**:
   - The code calculates PMDAU for each month by dividing the count of distinct senders by 30 (assuming 30 days in a month).

5. **Final Result Assignment**:
   - The result is assigned to the `result` variable.

We will use the UserSessions collection and the DATEDIFF function to compute session durations, then aggregate by user ID.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Filter the UserSessions collection to include only sessions within the specified date range:
   ```python
   sessions = UserSessions.WHERE(
       (session_start_ts >= DATETIME('2023-06-01')) & (session_start_ts < DATETIME('2023-06-08'))

       user_id=user_id,
       duration=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)
   )

3. Group the sessions by user ID and calculate the sum of durations for each user:
   ```python
   user_durations = session_durations.PARTITION(name=""users"", by=user_id).CALCULATE(
       user_id=user_id,

4. Sort the results by total duration in descending order:
   ```python
   result = user_durations.ORDER_BY(total_duration.DESC())

5. Convert the total duration to an integer:
   ```python
   result = result.CALCULATE(
       user_id=user_id,
       total_duration=INT(total_duration)
   )
   ```

Combining all steps, the complete code is:
```python
sessions = UserSessions.WHERE(

Return the coupon ID and total amount transacted with it.,"WITH merchant_coupon_usage AS (SELECT c.cid, t.amount FROM coupons AS c JOIN wallet_transactions_daily AS t ON c.cid = t.coupon_id WHERE c.merchant_id = 1) SELECT cid, SUM(amount) AS total_discount FROM merchant_coupon_usage GROUP BY cid;",Ewallet,"## Analysis of the Question

The question asks for the total transaction amount for each coupon offered by a specific merchant (merchant with ID 1). This requires:

1. Filtering coupons to only those offered by merchant with ID 1
2. For each of those coupons, summing up the amount from all transactions that used that coupon
3. Returning the coupon ID and the total transaction amount for each coupon

## PyDough Code Implementation

```python
coupons_by_merchant = Coupons.WHERE(merchant_id == 1)
coupon_amounts = coupons_by_merchant.CALCULATE(
    coupon_id=cid,
    total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
)
result = coupon_amounts
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. `coupons_by_merchant = Coupons.WHERE(merchant_id == 1)`
   This line filters the `Coupons` collection to only include coupons offered by merchant with ID 1. The result is a collection containing only those coupons.

2. `coupon_amounts = coupons_by_merchant.CALCULATE(
    coupon_id=cid,
    total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
)`
   This line creates a new collection called `coupon_amounts` by calculating two fields for each coupon:
   - `coupon_id`: The ID of the coupon (from the `cid` field)
   - `total_amount`: The sum of the amounts from all transactions that used this coupon
     (by summing the `amount` field across all records in the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection)

3. `result = coupon_amounts`
   This line simply assigns the `coupon_amounts` collection to the final result variable `result`.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through the following transformations:

1. Start with all coupons in the `Coupons` collection
2. Filter to only include coupons offered by merchant with ID 1
3. For each coupon, calculate its ID and the sum of amounts from all transactions that used it
4. The final result is a collection with each row representing a coupon, and two columns: `coupon_id` and `total_amount`

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Clear Variable Naming**: The code uses descriptive variable names like `coupons_by_merchant` and `coupon_amounts` that clearly indicate what the collections contain.

2. **Step-by-Step Approach**: The code breaks the problem into smaller steps, first filtering the coupons and then calculating the amounts.

3. **Proper Use of Collection Relationships**: The code correctly uses the relationship between coupons and transactions by accessing the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection and summing the amounts.

4. **Appropriate Aggregation**: The code uses the `SUM` function to aggregate the amounts across multiple transactions.

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using uppercase for PyDough functions (`WHERE`, `CALCULATE`, `SUM`)
2. Using descriptive variable names that follow Python's naming conventions
3. Using the proper syntax for accessing sub-collections (with the dot notation)
4. Using the proper syntax for filtering collections with `WHERE`
5. Using the proper syntax for calculating new fields with `CALCULATE`
6. Using the proper syntax for aggregation with `SUM`

The code avoids the bad examples mentioned in the PyDough documentation by:

1. Not using chained comparisons
2. Using `&` for AND operations instead of `and`
3. Not including a LIMIT clause (which is only needed for specific purposes)
4. Properly using aggregation functions (like `SUM`) for plural sub-collections
5. Not using positional arguments after keyword arguments in `CALCULATE`

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""the total transaction amount for each coupon offered by merchant with ID 1."" The code directly addresses this by:

1. Identifying coupons offered by merchant with ID 1 using `WHERE(merchant_id == 1)`
2. For each of those coupons, calculating the sum of the amounts from all transactions that used that coupon
3. Returning the coupon ID and total transaction amount for each coupon

The result collection contains exactly the information requested: the coupon ID and total amount transacted with it, for only coupons offered by the specified merchant.",7.473239421844482,"coupons_by_merchant = Coupons.WHERE(merchant_id == 1)

**Explanation:**

1. **Import Libraries**: The code imports necessary libraries for date calculations.
2. **Calculate Previous Month**: It calculates the first day of the current month and then subtracts a month to get the previous month's date. This is used for filtering transactions in the correct time frame.
3. **Filter Wallet Transactions**: It filters the `Transactions` collection to only include wallet transactions (transactions where either sender or receiver is a user).
4. **Count Total Transactions**: It counts the total number of wallet transactions that occurred in the previous month.
5. **Count Successful Transactions**: It counts the number of successful (status==""COMPLETED"") wallet transactions in the previous month.
6. **Calculate Success Rate**: It calculates the success transaction rate by dividing the number of successful transactions by the total number of transactions. The `SINGULAR` function is used to handle potential plural sub-collections. A check ensures that division by zero is avoided.
7. **Print Result**: Finally, it prints the calculated success rate.

This code follows PyDough best practices by breaking down the problem into logical steps and using appropriate functions such as `COUNT`, `WHERE`, and date/time manipulation functions. It also handles potential edge cases by checking for division by zero.",4.965565204620361,"from datetime import datetime, date, timedelta

Here's the PyDough code that answers the question:

```python
# 1. Calculate the number of coupons created in the same month for each merchant
merchants_with_coupon_counts = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    mid,
    name,
    creation_month=MONTH(created_at),
    coupon_count=COUNT(Coupons.WHERE(MONTH(created_at) == creation_month))
)

# 2. Find the merchant with the highest coupon count
result = merchants_with_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=coupon_count.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1. We start with the `Merchants` collection and calculate the number of coupons each merchant created in the same month they were created. We use `COUNT(Coupons.WHERE(MONTH(created_at) == creation_month))` to count coupons that have the same month value as the merchant's `created_at` field. We also include the merchant's `mid` (merchant ID), `name`, and the calculated `creation_month` for context.

2. We then use `TOP_K(1, by=coupon_count.DESC())` to find the merchant with the highest coupon count.

This code follows PyDough best practices by:

- Using clear, descriptive variable names
- Using aggregation functions like `COUNT` at the appropriate level
- Following the hierarchical navigation pattern (`Merchants.Coupons`)
- Using `WHERE` to filter data at the appropriate scope
- Using `TOP_K` instead of `ORDER_BY` for ordering and selection
- Calculating all necessary values in a single pass without intermediate steps unless necessary

The code directly addresses the original question by finding the merchant with the highest number of coupons created within the same month as their creation month, and returning the required fields (`mid`, `name`, and `coupon_count`).

This approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary complexity by directly calculating the required information in a single PyDough expression.

Then, it calculates the total number of unread notifications for those users.

PyDough Functions and Patterns Used:
1. **CALCULATE**: Used to derive new fields from collections [d7f3e66].
2. **WHERE**: Used to filter records based on conditions [d7f3e66].
3. **HAS**: Used to verify if a collection contains records [d7f3e66].
4. **COUNT**: An aggregation function used to count records [d7f3e66].
5. **LOWER**: A string function used to convert strings to lowercase [d7f3e66].

Data Flow and Transformations:
1. Start with the `Ewallet.Users` collection.
2. Calculate the `has_unread_promotional_notifications` flag by checking if there are any notifications with the specified type and status.
3. Filter the users to only include those from the US (case-insensitively).
4. Calculate the final result by selecting usernames and counting their unread promotional notifications.

PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated:

2. Using `LOWER` to perform case-insensitive comparisons [d7f3e66].
3. Breaking down the query into logical steps for readability.

How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions:
1. Uses dot notation to access sub-collections (`Users.notifications`) [d7f3e66].
2. Uses `CALCULATE` to define new fields and select fields for the output [d7f3e66].

1. **Analysis of Requirements**
The question asks for a count of distinct active users who sent money each month in 2023. The requirements include:
   - Only consider active users
   - Exclude merchants
   - Only include successful transactions
   - Count distinct users per month
   - Return the month and the count, ordered by month (earliest first)

2. **Step-by-Step Explanation of the Solution**
   a. Filter users to only include active users and exclude merchants:
      ```python
      active_users = Users.WHERE(
        (user_type != ""merchant"") & (status == ""active"")
      )
      ```

   b. Filter transactions to only include successful transactions and those sent in 2023:
      ```python
      transactions_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(
        (YEAR(created_at) == 2023) & (status == ""success"")
      )
      ```

   c. Calculate the month and year for each transaction:
      ```python
      tx_info = transactions_2023.CALCULATE(
        month=MONTH(created_at),
        year=YEAR(created_at),
        sender_id=sender_id
      )
      ```

   d. Partition transactions by month and count distinct active users who sent money in each month:
      ```python
      monthly_counts = PARTITION(tx_info, name=""transactions"", by=(year, month)).CALCULATE(
        month=DATETIME('2023-01-01', '+'+str(month-1)+' months'),
        num_active_users=COUNT(DISTINCT(active_users.WHERE(uid == sender_id)))
      ).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
      ```

3. **The Final PyDough Code**
   ```python
   active_users = Users.WHERE(
     (user_type != ""merchant"") & (status == ""active"")
   )

   transactions_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(
     (YEAR(created_at) == 2023) & (status == ""success"")
   )

   tx_info = transactions_2023.CALCULATE(
     month=MONTH(created_at),
     year=YEAR(created_at),
     sender_id=sender_id
   )

   monthly_counts = PARTITION(tx_info, name=""transactions"", by=(year, month)).CALCULATE(
     month=DATETIME('2023-01-01', '+'+str(month-1)+' months'),
     num_active_users=COUNT(DISTINCT(active_users.WHERE(uid == sender_id)))
   ).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
   ```

4. **Explanation of How the Code Works**
   - The code first filters users to only include active users who are not merchants.
   - Then, it filters transactions to only include successful transactions from 2023.
   - For each filtered transaction, it calculates the month and year.
   - It partitions these transactions by year and month, and for each month, it counts the distinct active users who sent money.
   - The result is ordered by month in ascending order, starting from the earliest month.
   - The DATETIME function is used to construct the correct month value from the date function.
   - The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each user is counted only once per month.

PyDough Code:
active_users = Users.WHERE(
    (user_type != ""merchant"") & (status == ""active"")
)

transactions_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(
    (YEAR(created_at) == 2023) & (status == ""success"")
)

tx_info = transactions_2023.CALCULATE(
    month=MONTH(created_at),
    year=YEAR(created_at),
    sender_id=sender_id
)

monthly_counts = PARTITION(tx_info, name=""transactions"", by=(year, month)).CALCULATE(
    month=DATETIME('2023-01-01', '+'+str(month-1)+' months'),
    num_active_users=COUNT(DISTINCT(active_users.WHERE(uid == sender_id)))
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())

# Explanation of PyDough Code for Counting Active Users Per Month

## Code Analysis

The provided PyDough code answers the question ""How many distinct active users sent money per month in 2023? Return the number of active users per month (as a date), starting from the earliest date. Do not include merchants in the query. Only include successful transactions.""

```python
active_users = Users.WHERE(
    (user_type != ""merchant"") & (status == ""active"")
)

transactions_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(
    (YEAR(created_at) == 2023) & (status == ""success"")
)

tx_info = transactions_2023.CALCULATE(
    month=MONTH(created_at),
    year=YEAR(created_at),
    sender_id=sender_id
)

monthly_counts = PARTITION(tx_info, name=""transactions"", by=(year, month)).CALCULATE(
    month=DATETIME('2023-01-01', '+'+str(month-1)+' months'),
    num_active_users=COUNT(DISTINCT(active_users.WHERE(uid == sender_id)))
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

## PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

### 1. Collection Access
The code starts by accessing two primary collections: `Users` and `Transactions`. In PyDough, collections represent data sources and are accessed using their names [ad232bd].

### 2. WHERE Function
The `WHERE` function is used to filter records in collections based on specified conditions [ad232bd]. 

```python
active_users = Users.WHERE((user_type != ""merchant"") & (status == ""active""))
```

This filters the `Users` collection to only include records where the `user_type` is not ""merchant"" and the `status` is ""active"". The `&` operator performs logical AND between the conditions.

```python
transactions_2023 = Transactions.WHERE((YEAR(created_at) == 2023) & (status == ""success""))
```

Similarly, this filters the `Transactions` collection to only include records created in 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`) with a status of ""success"".

### 3. CALCULATE Function
The `CALCULATE` function is used to derive new fields from existing collections [89b50e1]. It can select fields, derive new fields, or rename existing ones.

```python
tx_info = transactions_2023.CALCULATE(
    month=MONTH(created_at),
    year=YEAR(created_at),
    sender_id=sender_id
)
```

This creates a new collection `tx_info` from `transactions_2023` that includes:
- The month extracted from the `created_at` timestamp
- The year extracted from the `created_at` timestamp
- The sender_id from the original transaction record

### 4. PARTITION Function
The `PARTITION` function groups records by specified keys [5ba4e35]. It creates a new collection with grouped records.

```python
monthly_counts = PARTITION(tx_info, name=""transactions"", by=(year, month)).CALCULATE(
    month=DATETIME('2023-01-01', '+'+str(month-1)+' months'),
    num_active_users=COUNT(DISTINCT(active_users.WHERE(uid == sender_id)))
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

This partitions the `tx_info` collection by both year and month, creating a new collection called `monthly_counts` that groups transactions by month.

### 5. DISTINCT Function
The `DISTINCT` function ensures that only unique values are counted [f910234]. In this code, it's used with COUNT to count unique active users.

### 6. ORDER_BY Function
The `ORDER_BY` function sorts records based on specified fields [89b50e1]. In this case, it sorts the results by month in ascending order (ASC).

### 7. DATETIME Function
The `DATETIME` function is used to build date values [988171e]. In this code, it creates the first day of each month for display purposes.

```python
month=DATETIME('2023-01-01', '+'+str(month-1)+' months')
```

This takes '2023-01-01' as the base date and adds `month-1` months to it, creating a date representing the start of each month in 2023.

### 8. COUNT Function
The `COUNT` function counts the number of records in a collection [988171e]. In this code, it's used with DISTINCT to count unique active users who sent transactions in each month.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through several transformations:

1. Start with the `Users` collection and filter for active users who are not merchants
2. Start with the `Transactions` collection and filter for successful transactions in 2023
3. Extract month and year information from the filtered transactions
4. Partition the transaction information by year and month
5. For each month partition, count unique active users who sent transactions that month
6. Sort the results by month in ascending order

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Descriptive Variable Names**: The code uses clear, descriptive variable names like `active_users`, `transactions_2023`, and `monthly_counts` [ad232bd].

2. **Logical Decomposition**: The code breaks down the complex query into smaller, logical steps [ad232bd].

3. **Proper Filtering**: The code filters data appropriately at each step, ensuring only relevant records are processed [ad232bd].

4. **Appropriate Use of Functions**: The code uses PyDough's built-in functions (COUNT, DISTINCT, ORDER_BY, WHERE, CALCULATE, PARTITION) correctly [89b50e1].

5. **Meaningful Results**: The final result provides the information exactly as requested: a count of distinct active users who sent money per month in 2023, with results ordered by month.

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the count of distinct active users who sent money per month in 2023, ordered by month.

The code directly addresses this by:
1. Identifying active users who are not merchants using `Users.WHERE((user_type != ""merchant"") & (status == ""active""))`
2. Identifying successful transactions from 2023 using `Transactions.WHERE((YEAR(created_at) == 2023) & (status == ""success""))`
3. Grouping these transactions by month using `PARTITION(..., by=(year, month))`
4. Counting distinct active users who sent transactions in each month using `COUNT(DISTINCT(active_users.WHERE(uid == sender_id)))`
5. Sorting the results by month in ascending order using `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`

The result `monthly_counts` contains exactly what was asked for: the month and the count of distinct active users who sent money in that month, ordered by month.

## PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:
1. Using the dot notation to navigate from collections to sub-collections [ad232bd]
2. Using uppercase for PyDough operations (WHERE, CALCULATE, PARTITION, ORDER_BY) [89b50e1]
3. Using proper function syntax with required parameters
4. Using the correct logical operators (`&` for AND, `==` for equality)
5. Properly using DISTINCT with COUNT to count unique values [f910234]
6.

What are the top 2 most frequently used device types for user sessions and their respective counts?,"SELECT device_type, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM user_sessions GROUP BY device_type ORDER BY CASE WHEN COUNT IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END DESC, COUNT DESC LIMIT 2;",Ewallet,"I'll analyze the question and create the PyDough code using the provided documentation.

## Analysis of the Question

The question asks for:
1. The top 2 most frequently used device types
2. The count of each of these device types

This requires grouping sessions by device type and counting the occurrences of each type, then taking the top 2 based on count.

## PyDough Code

```python
device_type_counts = UserSessions.PARTITION(
    name=""devices"", by=device_type
).CALCULATE(
    device_type=device_type,
    count=COUNT(devices)
).TOP_K(2, by=count.DESC())
```

## Explanation

### 1. Partitioning
The code starts with the `UserSessions` collection and uses the `PARTITION` operation [c844ad5]. It groups the sessions by `device_type` and assigns the name ""devices"" to this partition.

```python
UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""devices"", by=device_type)
```

This creates groups where each unique device type has its corresponding sessions grouped together.

### 2. Calculation
After partitioning, the code uses `CALCULATE` to define two fields [f8ad97e]:
- `device_type`: The name of the device type
- `count`: The number of sessions for this device type, using the `COUNT` aggregation function

```python
.CALCULATE(
    device_type=device_type,
    count=COUNT(devices)
)
```

### 3. Top-K Selection
Finally, the code uses `TOP_K` to select the top 2 device types based on their counts [8da2ed8]:

```python
.TOP_K(2, by=count.DESC())
```

This sorts the grouped device types in descending order by count (highest count first) and selects the top 2 records.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The code uses the natural hierarchical structure of the data, starting with sessions and partitioning them by device type [988171e].

2. **Appropriate Aggregation**: It correctly uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of sessions for each device type [f8ad97e].

3. **Concise Code**: The code is relatively short and readable, demonstrating PyDough's ability to express complex operations in a concise way [988171e].

4. **Proper Naming**: The code uses descriptive names for variables and operations, making it easy to understand what each step does [f8ad97e].

5. **Correct Partitioning**: The code uses `PARTITION` appropriately to group sessions by device type before performing calculations [c844ad5].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Hierarchical Data Model**: The code leverages PyDough's hierarchical data model by navigating from `UserSessions` to `device_type` [988171e].

2. **Aggregation Functions**: The code uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of sessions, which is a standard PyDough pattern [f8ad97e].

3. **TOP_K Usage**: The code correctly uses `TOP_K` to select the top 2 records based on a sorting criterion [8da2ed8].

4. **Logical Flow**: The code follows a logical flow of data transformation: group by device type → calculate counts → select top 2 [c844ad5, f8ad97e, 8da2ed8].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""the top 2 most frequently used device types and their respective counts."" The code directly addresses this by:

1. Grouping sessions by device type
2. Counting how many sessions exist for each device type
3. Selecting the top 2 device types with the highest counts
4. Returning both the device type and its count in the result set

The result will be a collection with two records, each containing a device type and the number of sessions that used that device type.

What are the top 3 most common transaction statuses and their respective counts?,"SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM wallet_transactions_daily GROUP BY status ORDER BY CASE WHEN COUNT IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END DESC, COUNT DESC LIMIT 3;",Ewallet,"Answer:
1. **Analysis of the question:**
The question asks for the top 3 most common transaction statuses and their counts. This requires counting occurrences of each status and then selecting the top 3 with the highest counts.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution:**
   - Start with the Transactions collection.
   - Group the transactions by their status.
   - Count the number of transactions for each status.
   - Sort the statuses by their counts in descending order.
   - Select the top 3 statuses.

3. **The PyDough code:**
```python
transaction_statuses = Transactions.PARTITION(name=""statuses"", by=status).CALCULATE(
    status=status,
    count=COUNT(Transactions)
).TOP_K(3, by=count.DESC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works:**
   - `Transactions.PARTITION(name=""statuses"", by=status)`: This groups the transactions by their status, creating a collection where each record represents a unique status.
   - `.CALCULATE(status=status, count=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each unique status, it calculates the status value and the count of transactions with that status. The count is computed using the COUNT function on the Transactions collection within each partition.
   - `.TOP_K(3, by=count.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 transaction statuses based on their counts in descending order, answering the question of finding the most common statuses.

# Reference to PyDough Reference File

This code directly follows the pattern shown in the reference document for aggregation and sorting (Examples 1 and 2 under ""PARTITION""):

```python
package_info = Packages.CALCULATE(order_year=YEAR(order_date), order_month=MONTH(order_date))
packages.PARTITION(package_info, name=""months"", by=(order_year, order_month)).CALCULATE(
avg_package_cost=AVG(Packages.package_cost)
).Packages.WHERE(
package_cost < avg_package_cost
)
```

The TOP_K pattern with DESC() is shown in multiple examples, such as Example 3 under ""SORTING"":

```python
Packages.TOP_K(10, by=package_cost.DESC())
```

And under ""8. Window Functions - RELSUM"":

```python
Customers.CALCULATE(ratio=acctbal / RELSUM(acctbal))
```

The grouping approach follows the ""PARTITION"" examples in section 7 of the PyDough Reference File.

# Data Flow Analysis

The data flows through these steps:
1. Transactions collection is partitioned by status
2. For each status, the count of transactions with that status is calculated
3. The results are sorted by count in descending order
4. The top 3 records are selected

# PyDough Best Practices Applied

The code applies several PyDough best practices:
1. **Clear variable naming**: `transaction_statuses` clearly indicates what the collection contains.
2. **Concise expression**: The code expresses the query in a readable, compact way.
3. **Appropriate use of PARTITION**: It correctly uses PARTITION to group data by status.
4. **Efficient data transformation**: The code only calculates what's needed for the final result.

# How This Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the top 3 most common transaction statuses and their counts. The code directly addresses this by:
1. Grouping transactions by status
2. Counting transactions for each status
3. Selecting the top 3 statuses by count

The output contains exactly the information requested: the 3 most common transaction statuses and their respective counts.

# Alternative Approaches

An alternative approach could use a slightly more verbose method:

```python

).TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())
```

Explanation:
1. We start with the `Coupons` collection.
2. We use `CALCULATE` to derive three fields:
   - `code`: The coupon code.
   - `total_redemptions`: The count of transactions using this coupon (redemptions).
   - `total_amount_redeemed`: The sum of transaction amounts for transactions using this coupon.
3. We use `TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())` to select the top 3 coupons based on the number of redemptions in descending order. This gives us the most frequently used coupon codes.

PyDough Code:
top_coupons = Coupons.CALCULATE(
code=code,
total_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in),
total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
).TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())

Code Context:
# Explanation of PyDough Code for Top Coupon Codes Query

The PyDough code in question answers the query ""What are the top 3 most frequently used coupon codes? Return the coupon code, total number of redemptions, and total amount redeemed."" by using the following PyDough operations and patterns:

```python
top_coupons = Coupons.CALCULATE(
    code=code,
    total_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in),
    total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
).TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())
```

## 1. Collection Access

The code starts by accessing the `Coupons` collection, which contains all coupon data [bde7e1c]. This is the foundation for all subsequent operations.

## 2. Calculate Operation

The `CALCULATE` operation is used to derive new fields and rename existing ones [bde7e1c]:
```python
Coupons.CALCULATE(
    code=code,
    total_redemptions=COUNT(transaction_used_in),
    total_amount_redeemed=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
)
```

This operation creates three fields:
- `code`: The coupon code (presumably the same as the original field)
- `total_redemptions`: The count of all transactions where the coupon was used
- `total_amount_redeemed`: The sum of all transaction amounts for transactions using the coupon

As noted in the documentation [bde7e1c], ""Fields defined in a `CALCULATE` do not take effect until after the `CALCULATE` completes. If you want to access the new field defined, you must use `CALCULATE` again to reference it.""

## 3. Aggregation Functions

The code uses two aggregation functions [89585d3]:

- `COUNT(transaction_used_in)`: Counts the number of transactions that used the coupon
- `SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Sums the amounts of all transactions that used the coupon

As the documentation notes [89585d3], ""CALCULATE ONLY supports singular expressions. If you need to use plural sub-collections, you MUST use aggregation functions. Plural sub-collections refer to collections that have a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship.""

## 4. TOP_K Operation

The `TOP_K` operation [56ea902] selects the top k records based on specified sorting criteria:
```python
).TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())
```

In this case, it selects the top 3 coupons based on the `total_redemptions` field in descending order (DESC), meaning the coupons with the highest number of redemptions appear first.

## 5. Sorting

The `.DESC()` modifier [56ea902] indicates descending sort order, which is necessary when using TOP_K:

```python
).TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())
```

According to the documentation [56ea902], ""TOP_K must always have a sorting criteria, specified through the `by` parameter.""

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flow in this code follows these steps:
1. Start with the `Coupons` collection
2. Calculate fields related to each coupon:
   - The coupon code
   - Count of transactions where the coupon was used
   - Total amount redeemed using the coupon
3. Sort these coupons by the number of redemptions in descending order
4. Take only the top 3 coupons with the highest redemption counts

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Clear field naming**: The code uses descriptive field names like `total_redemptions` and `total_amount_redeemed` that clearly indicate what the fields represent [bde7e1c].

2. **Aggregation for plural sub-collections**: When dealing with the sub-collection `transaction_used_in`, the code correctly uses aggregation functions (COUNT and SUM) to get a singular result [89585d3].

3. **Explicit ordering for TOP_K**: The code correctly uses the `by` parameter with a sort modifier (`.DESC()`) when using TOP_K [56ea902].

4. **Concise expression**: The code expresses a complex query in a single, readable expression that chains operations in a logical sequence [bde7e1c].

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions by:

1. Using the proper operation sequence: Collection -> Calculate -> Sort [bde7e1c, 56ea902]
2. Properly using aggregation functions to handle plural sub-collections [89585d3]
3. Following the TOP_K syntax by including a sorting criteria [56ea902]
4. Using descriptive variable names that clearly indicate what they represent [bde7e1c]
5. Building the query in a step-by-step, logical progression [bde7e1c]

This code efficiently answers the original question by first preparing the data with CALCULATE, then filtering with TOP_K, following the standard PyDough pattern of ""Data -> Operations -> Result.""",10.116536140441895,").TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1444 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=1444)] prompt_token_count=19826 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19826)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=21270 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

Explanation:
The code starts with the `Countries` collection and calculates the following metrics for each country:
1. `country_name`: The name of the country.
2. `total_users`: The total number of users in that country.
3. `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of transaction amounts for all transactions sent by users (`sender_type == ""0""`).

Finally, it uses `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 5 countries based on the total transaction amount in descending order.

I would consider this a good implementation because it efficiently calculates the required metrics in a single query and returns the result in the specified format. It follows PyDough best practices by using appropriate aggregation functions and filtering the data based on the specified criteria.

The code avoids the bad examples mentioned in the PyDough Reference File by:
1. Using the correct logical operators (&, |, ~) instead of and, or, not.
2. Properly referencing the fields and tables as defined in the Database Structure Reference File.
3. Using the appropriate functions and parameters for aggregation (SUM, COUNT) and sorting (TOP_K with DESC).

1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks for the top 2 merchants who have received the most money in the past 150 days.
We need to consider:
- Receiver type 1 (merchants)
- Transactions within the past 150 days
- Total transaction amount
- Sorting and limiting to the top 2

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
a. Filter transactions to only include receiver type 1 and those within the past 150 days
b. Calculate total transaction amount and count for each merchant
c. Sort the merchants by transaction amount in descending order
d. Select the top 2 merchants

3. **The PyDough code**
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

current_date = datetime.now()
cutoff_date = current_date - timedelta(days=150)

merchant_txns = Transactions.WHERE(
    (receiver_type == 1) & (created_at >= cutoff_date)
).CALCULATE(amount, merchant_id=receiver_id)

merchant_totals = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    name=name,
    num_txns=COUNT(merchant_txns),
    total_amount=SUM(merchant_txns.amount)
).TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())

result = merchant_totals.CALCULATE(
    merchant_name=name,
    total_transactions=num_txns,
    total_amount=total_amount
)
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**
a. We calculate the cutoff date by subtracting 150 days from the current date
b. We filter transactions to include only those with receiver type 1 (merchants) and that were created in the past 150 days
c. We calculate for each merchant the total number of transactions and the total amount received
d. We sort the merchants by total amount received in descending order and take the top 2
e. We select the merchant name, total transactions, and total amount to be returned in the result

Pydough Code:
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

current_date = datetime.now()
cutoff_date = current_date - timedelta(days=150)

merchant_txns = Transactions.WHERE(
    (receiver_type == 1) & (created_at >= cutoff_date)
).CALCULATE(amount, merchant_id=receiver_id)

merchant_totals = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    name=name,
    num_txns=COUNT(merchant_txns),
    total_amount=SUM(merchant_txns.amount)
).TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())

result = merchant_totals.CALCULATE(
    merchant_name=name,
    total_transactions=num_txns,
    total_amount=total_amount
)

Code Context:
# Explanation of PyDough Code for Top 2 Merchants Query

## Overview

The provided PyDough code answers the question ""Who are the top 2 merchants (receiver type 1) by total transaction amount in the past 150 days (inclusive of 150 days ago)? Return the merchant name, total number of transactions, and total transaction amount.""

Let's break down how this code works by analyzing its key components and PyDough-specific patterns.

## 1. Date Calculations

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

current_date = datetime.now()
cutoff_date = current_date - timedelta(days=150)
```

This section imports Python's datetime module and defines:
- `current_date`: The current timestamp
- `cutoff_date`: A timestamp 150 days before the current date

This sets the timeframe for the query, ensuring we only consider transactions from the past 150 days.

## 2. Filtering Transactions

```python
merchant_txns = Transactions.WHERE(
    (receiver_type == 1) & (created_at >= cutoff_date)
).CALCULATE(amount, merchant_id=receiver_id)
```

This part filters the Transactions collection based on two conditions:
- `receiver_type == 1`: Only considers transactions where the receiver type is 1 (merchants)
- `created_at >= cutoff_date`: Only considers transactions created on or after the cutoff date (past 150 days)

It then uses `CALCULATE` to:
- Keep the `amount` field
- Rename `receiver_id` to `merchant_id` for clarity in the next step

This filtered collection, named `merchant_txns`, contains only recent transactions to merchants.

## 3. Aggregating Merchant Data

```python
merchant_totals = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    name=name,
    num_txns=COUNT(merchant_txns),
    total_amount=SUM(merchant_txns.amount)
).TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())
```

This section:
1. Uses the `Merchants` collection as its base
2. For each merchant, it calculates:
   - `name=name`: Keeps the merchant's name field
   - `num_txns=COUNT(merchant_txns)`: Counts the number of transactions in the filtered `merchant_txns` collection associated with this merchant
   - `total_amount=SUM(merchant_txns.amount)`: Sums the amounts of all transactions in the filtered `merchant_txns` collection associated with this merchant
3. Applies `TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())` to select only the top 2 merchants based on total transaction amount in descending order

The result is a collection `merchant_totals` containing the top 2 merchants by transaction amount.

## 4. Final Result Formatting

```python
result = merchant_totals.CALCULATE(
    merchant_name=name,
    total_transactions=num_txns,
    total_amount=total_amount
)
```

This section simply reformats the output:
- Renames `name` to `merchant_name`
- Renames `num_txns` to `total_transactions`
- Keeps `total_amount` field as is

This ensures the output has the requested column names and structure.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Incremental Building**: The code builds the solution in logical steps, creating intermediate collections (merchant_txns, merchant_totals) before arriving at the final result [bd5ac60].

2. **Descriptive Variable Names**: Variables like `cutoff_date`, `merchant_txns`, and `merchant_totals` clearly indicate what data they contain [bd5ac60].

3. **Appropriate Use of Aggregation Functions**: The code uses `COUNT` and `SUM` to aggregate plural collections into singular values, which is a common pattern in PyDough [3c8c72d].

4. **Proper Use of `TOP_K`**: The code correctly uses `TOP_K` with a sorting expression (`total_amount.DESC()`) as required for ranking results [3c8c72d].

5. **Clear Data Transformation**: The code shows clear transformations from raw data to aggregated data to final formatted output [bd5ac60].

## PyDough Conventions Followed

The code follows PyDough conventions:

1. **Collection-First Approach**: The code starts with collections (`Transactions`, `Merchants`) and applies operations to them [bd5ac60].

2. **Chaining Operations**: The code chains operations in a logical sequence (WHERE → CALCULATE → TOP_K) [bd5ac60].

3. **Hierarchical Thinking**: The code demonstrates PyDough's hierarchical document model by accessing related collections (Transactions for Merchants) [bd5ac60].

4. **Descriptive Field Naming**: While some fields are renamed for clarity, the code maintains consistency in naming conventions [bd5ac60].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The code directly addresses the question by:
1. Identifying transactions related to merchants (receiver type 1)
2. Filtering these transactions to only include those from the past 150 days
3. Calculating the total transaction amount and count for each merchant
4. Selecting the top 2 merchants with the highest total transaction amounts
5. Returning the merchant name, total number of transactions, and total transaction amount

The final result collection directly answers the question by providing the requested information in the specified format.

## Similar Examples from the Search Results

From the search results, we can see similar patterns in other PyDough queries:

```python
# Example of TOP_K with DESC()
nations.CALCULATE(
    name,
    revenue = SUM(customers.orders.total_price)
).TOP_K(5, by=revenue.DESC())
```

This example [3c8c72d] shows a similar pattern of calculating revenue for nations and then using TOP_K to select the top 5.

Another relevant example shows filtering and aggregation:
```python
Packages.WHERE(package_cost > 1000).CALCULATE(package_cost)
```
This [3c8c72d] demonstrates how PyDough uses the pattern of filtering with WHERE followed by selecting fields with CALCULATE, similar to our code.

In conclusion, the PyDough code efficiently answers the question by using proper date calculations, filtering, aggregation, and result formatting techniques that align with PyDough's document-first thinking paradigm.",14.363851070404053,Packages.WHERE(package_cost > 1000).CALCULATE(package_cost),"cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=2100 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=2100)] prompt_token_count=19847 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19847)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=21947 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

1. Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only active merchants whose category contains 'retail'.
2. Calculate the median merchant wallet balance for the filtered merchants.
3. Return the median balance.

This code:
1. Filters the `Merchants` collection to include only those with an ""active"" status and whose category contains ""retail"".
2. Calculates the median wallet balance for the filtered merchants using the `MEDIAN` function on the `balances.balance` field.
3. Uses `.SINGULAR()` to ensure a single result (as described in the documentation: ""The median function does not support calling on plural terms unless using `SINGULAR()`"").

**Explanation:**

2. **Get the setting snapshot with the earliest date:** We use the result from step 1 to filter the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to get the snapshot with the earliest date. We also use `.SINGULAR()` to ensure we're working with a single record.

3. **Calculate and return the average transaction limits:** Finally, we calculate the average daily and monthly transaction limits from the retrieved snapshot. The `GRAPH.CALCULATE` creates a single-row collection with the requested fields.

Explanation:

1. We start by calculating the session duration for each record in the UserSessions collection. We use the DATEDIFF function to calculate the difference between session_start_ts and session_end_ts in seconds, and we include the device_type in the CALCULATE expression.

2. Next, we use the PARTITION function to group the session data by device_type. This creates groups of sessions for each unique device_type.

3. Finally, we use the CALCULATE function on the partitioned data to calculate the average session duration for each device_type. We also keep the device_type in the output.

    registration_date,
    earliest_coupon_id=earliest_coupon.cid,
    earliest_coupon_start_date=earliest_coupon.start_date,
)
```

Code Explanation:
1. The code starts with the `Merchants` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to derive several fields:
   - `merchant_id=mid`: This selects the merchant's ID (mid) and renames it to merchant_id.
   - `registration_date=created_at`: This selects the merchant's registration date (created_at) and renames it to registration_date.
   - `earliest_coupon`: This uses the `MIN` function with a nested `CALCULATE` expression. It finds the earliest coupon for each merchant where the difference between the coupon's start date and the merchant's registration date is less than a year. The `YEAR(1)` function is used to get a year interval.

2. The result is then filtered to return only the requested information: merchant_id, registration_date, earliest_coupon_id, and earliest_coupon_start_date. The code accesses the attributes of the `earliest_coupon` field using dot notation (`.cid` and `.start_date`).

Data Flow:
The data flows from the `Merchants` collection to the `CALCULATE` function, which derives fields for each merchant. The `MIN` function is used within the `CALCULATE` expression to find the earliest coupon within a year of registration. The final result is produced by selecting specific fields from the calculated merchant information.

PyDough Functions and Patterns Used:
1. `CALCULATE`: Used to derive new fields from collections.
2. `MIN`: Used to find the minimum value of a field across multiple records.
3. `WHERE`: Used to filter collections based on a condition.
4. Relationship traversal: Navigating from Merchants to their related Coupons.
5. Filtering within aggregation: Filtering coupons by date before finding the minimum start date.

Best Practices Demonstrated:
1. Breaking down a complex query into logical steps.
2. Using meaningful variable names.
3. Renaming fields to be more descriptive (e.g., mid → merchant_id, created_at → registration_date).
4. Using the correct aggregation function (`MIN`) for the requirement (finding the earliest coupon).
5. Using a separate `CALCULATE` to derive fields from sub-collections.

Compliance with PyDough Conventions:
1. The code follows the PyDough pattern of starting with a collection (Merchants) and applying operations.
2. It uses the correct syntax for `CALCULATE` with named parameters.
3. It properly uses aggregation functions within `CALCULATE` expressions.
4. It follows the convention of using dot notation to access related collections.
5. It uses the recommended pattern of creating intermediate variables for clarity.

How the Code Addresses the Original Question:
The code directly addresses the original question by:
1. Identifying merchants.
2. Finding their earliest coupon that started within a year of their registration date.
3. Returning the merchant ID, registration date, earliest coupon ID, and earliest coupon start date.

The code handles date comparisons correctly by using subtraction and the `YEAR` function. The `MIN` function ensures that we only get the earliest coupon for each merchant.

    signup_date=created_at
)
```

**Code Explanation:**

The code identifies users who did not receive any notifications within the first year of their account creation.

1. **Collection Selection:**
   The code starts with the `Users` collection, which contains user account information.

2. **Filtering Condition:**
   It filters these users based on the condition:
   ```
   NOT(HAS(notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""years"", created_at, ""now"") < 1)))
   ```
   This checks if there are any notifications associated with a user that were created within 1 year of their signup date (`created_at`). The `NOT` operator then inverts this condition to find users who have no such notifications.
   - `HAS(notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""years"", created_at, ""now"") < 1))` checks if a user has any notifications created within the first year of their account.
   - `DATEDIFF(""years"", created_at, ""now"") < 1` calculates the difference in years between the user's creation date and the current date, ensuring we only consider notifications created within one year.

3. **Field Selection:**
   For the filtered users, the code selects the following fields:
   - `username`: User's username
   - `email`: User's email address
   - `signup_date`: User's account creation date

4. **Result Assignment:**
   The final result is stored in the variable `users_without_notifications`.

This approach is efficient because it directly checks for the absence of notifications within the specified timeframe without requiring complex joins or aggregations.",4.040750026702881,"NOT(HAS(notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""years"", created_at, ""now"") < 1)))","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=460 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=460)] prompt_token_count=19821 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19821)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=20281 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"
