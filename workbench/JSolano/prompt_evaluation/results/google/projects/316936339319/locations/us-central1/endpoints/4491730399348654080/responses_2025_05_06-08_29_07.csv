```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate total transactions**: The code first calculates the total number of transactions for each customer using the `COUNT` function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection of the `Customers` collection.
2. **Filter customers**: It then filters the customers to only include those with at least 5 transactions.
3. **Calculate successful transactions**: The code calculates the number of successful transactions for each customer by filtering the `Transactions` collection to only include ""buy"" or ""sell"" transactions. It then partitions these transactions by customer ID and counts them.
4. **Calculate success rate**: Finally, it calculates the success rate for each customer by dividing the number of successful transactions by the total number of transactions. It then orders the results from lowest to highest success rate.

This code follows the PyDough conventions shown in the examples:
- Uses CALCULATE to create new fields
- Uses WHERE to filter collections
- Uses PARTITION to group transactions by customer ID
- Uses COUNT to count transactions
- Uses ORDER_BY to sort the results
- Converts successful_transactions to FLOAT to ensure correct division

The code is also structured logically and follows the best practices shown in the examples.",4.674469232559204,"# Calculate the total number of transactions for each customer

## Code Analysis

```python
faang_tickers = Tickers.WHERE(
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'AMZN') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'AAPL') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'GOOGL') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'META') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'NFLX')
)

distinct_customers = Customers.WHERE(
    ENDSWITH(email, '.com') &
    HAS(transactions_made.ticker.WHERE(ISIN(ticker_id, faang_tickers.ticker_id)))
)

result = TPCH.CALCULATE(
    num_distinct_customers=COUNT(distinct_customers)
)
```

## Data Flow and Transformations

The code performs the following steps:

1. **Define FAANG Tickers**: It creates a collection called `faang_tickers` by filtering the `Tickers` collection to include only those where the ticker symbol contains 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', or 'NFLX'.

```python
faang_tickers = Tickers.WHERE(
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'AMZN') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'AAPL') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'GOOGL') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'META') |
    CONTAINS(symbol, 'NFLX')
)
```

2. **Identify Distinct Customers**: It filters the `Customers` collection to include only those with '.com' email addresses who have made transactions of FAANG stocks. This is achieved by checking that their `transactions_made` subcollection includes at least one transaction where the `ticker_id` is in the list of FAANG ticker IDs.

```python
distinct_customers = Customers.WHERE(
    ENDSWITH(email, '.com') &
    HAS(transactions_made.ticker.WHERE(ISIN(ticker_id, faang_tickers.ticker_id)))
)
```

3. **Count Distinct Customers**: Finally, it calculates the count of distinct customers who meet the specified criteria and assigns it to `num_distinct_customers`.

```python
result = TPCH.CALCULATE(
    num_distinct_customers=COUNT(distinct_customers)
)
```

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Clear Variable Names**: The code uses descriptive variable names like `faang_tickers` and `distinct_customers`, making it easy to understand what each collection contains [988171e].

2. **Hierarchical Filtering**: The code demonstrates how to filter through multiple levels of relationships, going from Customers → Transactions → Tickers [5087683].

3. **Boolean Operators**: The code correctly uses the logical OR operator `|` to combine conditions [5087683].

4. **Function Combinations**: The code effectively combines `ENDSWITH`, `HAS`, `WHERE`, and `ISIN` to achieve the desired filtering criteria [8ad9c9f].

5. **Appropriate Aggregation**: The code correctly uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of records in a collection [8ad9c9f].

## How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Collection Access**: The code properly accesses collections like `Tickers` and `Customers` using dot notation to navigate relationships [988171e].

2. **Filtering with WHERE**: The code uses the `.WHERE()` method to filter collections based on specific conditions [988171e].

3. **Property Access**: The code correctly accesses properties of collections using dot notation, like `Ticker.symbol` and `Customer.email` [988171e].

4. **Aggregation with COUNT**: The code uses the `COUNT()` function to count records in a collection, which is a standard aggregation function in PyDough [8ad9c9f].

5. **Using TPCH as Entry Point**: The code uses TPCH (the dataset) as the entry point for the calculation [8ad9c9f].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the count of distinct customers who:

1. Have a '.com' email address
2. Bought stocks of FAANG companies (Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, or Netflix)

The code directly addresses these requirements by:

1. Creating `faang_tickers` collection with all FAANG tickers
2. Filtering `Customers` to only include those with '.com' email addresses
3. Checking that these customers have transactions involving FAANG stocks by using the `ISIN` operator with the `faang_tickers` collection
4. Counting the number of customers who meet all these criteria

## Similar Examples from Search Results

A similar example from the search results is:

```python
# For every package that was ordered in the past year, and cost more than $10,
# what state was it shipping to, and how many packages were there per state?
pack_info = packages.WHERE(
    order_date >= today.replace(year=year-1)
)
pack_states = PARTITION(
    pack_info.WHERE(
        package_cost > 10
    ).CALCULATE(shipping_state=shipping_address.state),
    name=""states"",
    by=shipping_state
)
state_counts = pack_states.CALCULATE(
    state=shipping_state,
    num_packages=COUNT(states)
)
```

This example [e0d3f87] shows a similar pattern of filtering collections, creating calculated fields, and using aggregation functions.

## Conclusion

The PyDough code effectively answers the original question by creating a clear, concise query that identifies and counts distinct customers with '.com' email addresses who bought stocks of FAANG companies. It follows PyDough best practices and conventions, making the code readable and maintainable.",9.698201417922974,"# For every package that was ordered in the past year, and cost more than $10,

"How many TAC are there from each country, for customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023? Return the country and the count.TAC = Total Active Customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023","SELECT sbCustCountry, COUNT(sbCustId) AS TAC FROM sbCustomer WHERE sbCustJoinDate >= '2023-01-01' GROUP BY sbCustCountry;",Broker,"I'll analyze the question and provide a step-by-step explanation of how to solve it using PyDough, along with the code.

**Analysis**

The question asks for:
1. Counting TAC (Total Active Customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023)
2. Grouping these customers by country
3. Returning the country name and the count of TAC for each country

This requires filtering customers based on join date, grouping by country, and then counting the active customers in each country. We can use the following PyDough operations:
- `WHERE` to filter customers based on join date
- `PARTITION` to group customers by country
- `CALCULATE` to compute the count of active customers and return the country name
- `HAS` to check for active customers (customers with transactions)

**Step-by-step Explanation**

1. Filter customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023:
```python
customers_2023 = Customers.WHERE(join_date >= DATETIME('2023-01-01'))
```
This creates a collection `customers_2023` that contains only customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023.

2. Partition these customers by country:
```python
country_groups = PARTITION(customers_2023, name=""cust"", by=country)
```
This groups the filtered customers by their country of residence.

3. Calculate the count of active customers in each country:
```python
result = country_groups.CALCULATE(
    country_name=country,
    tac=COUNT(cust.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))
)
```
For each country group, we calculate the count of active customers (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1` checks if a customer has transactions) and store it in the `tac` field. We also include the country name for identification.

**PyDough Code**

```python
customers_2023 = Customers.WHERE(join_date >= DATETIME('2023-01-01'))
country_groups = PARTITION(customers_2023, name=""cust"", by=country)
result = country_groups.CALCULATE(
    country_name=country,
    tac=COUNT(cust.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))
)
```

**Data Flow and Transformations**

The data flows through the following transformations:
1. Start with the `Customers` collection
2. Filter to keep only customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023
3. Group these customers by country
4. For each country group, count how many customers have transactions (active customers)
5. Return the country name and the count of active customers for each country

**PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated**

- Using `PARTITION` to group data when aggregation is required (as per the documentation: ""A key operation that PyDough provides is the ability to partition records into groups, and then perform operations on those groups"")
- Using `HAS` to check for existence of records in a subcollection (as per the documentation: ""You should use `HAS` function to verify the 1 to N relationship between tables, and you can identify them because the related subcollection has a plural name"")
- Using meaningful variable names (customers_2023, country_groups, result)
- Following the recommended pattern of filter-then-partition-then-calculate
- Keeping expressions concise and readable

To solve this, we need to:
1. Calculate the end date of the current week (Saturday)
2. Calculate the date range for the last 8 weeks from that end date
3. Filter the Transactions collection to include only transactions within this date range
4. Calculate the count of transactions for each week
5. Calculate the count of transactions that occurred on weekends for each week

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
current_date = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '+ 6 D') # Get Saturday of current week
eight_weeks_ago = DATETIME(current_date, '- 56 D') # Calculate date 8 weeks ago

weekly_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(

        DAYOFWEEK(date_time) >= 6 # Saturday and Sunday
    ))
)

result = weekly_transaction_counts.ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())
```

Explanation:
1. We start by calculating the current date and end of week.
2. We then calculate the start date of the date range (8 weeks ago).
3. We filter the Transactions collection to include only transactions within this date range.
4. For each week, we calculate:
   - The start of the week
   - The total count of transactions
   - The count of transactions that occurred on weekends (Saturday and Sunday, where DAYOFWEEK() >= 6)
5. Finally, we order the results by week start date in ascending order.

- PARTITION for grouping transactions by week
- COUNT for counting transactions
- WHERE for filtering transactions by date range and weekday

1.  We need to get customer information including name, number of transactions, total transaction amount, and customer rank based on total transaction amount.
2.  The ranking should be done based on total transaction amount, with rank 1 being the customer with the highest total transaction amount.

I'll use the appropriate PyDough operations and functions to address this requirement. First, I'll calculate the total transaction amount for each customer, then rank them based on this amount, and finally select the required fields.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
customer_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made),
    total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)
)

customer_summary = customer_summary.CALCULATE(
    CR=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())
)

result = customer_summary.CALCULATE(customer_name, num_transactions, total_transaction_amount, CR)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `Customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive the required fields:
    *   `customer_name`: Extracts the name of the customer.
    *   `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions made by each customer using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Sums the amount of all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function on the `transactions_made.amount` sub-collection.

2.  In the second `CALCULATE` operation, we compute the customer rank (`CR`) using the `RANKING` function, ordering by `total_transaction_amount` in descending order. This ensures that the customer with the highest total transaction amount gets a rank of 1.

3.  Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to select only the specific fields requested in the output: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, `total_transaction_amount`, and `CR`.

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the date 10 days ago:**
   - `DATE('now', '-10D')` calculates the date 10 days ago from the current date. This uses the date calculation functionality of PyDough as described in the documentation.

2. **Filter transactions:**
   - `Transactions.WHERE((transaction_type == 'buy') & (date_time >= ten_days_ago))` filters the transactions to only include those that are of type 'buy' and occur within the past 10 days. The code uses `&` instead of `and` as required by PyDough syntax.

3. **Partition and count tickers:**
   - `.PARTITION(name=""tickers"", by=ticker.symbol)` groups the transactions by ticker symbol.
   - `.CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol, num_buy_transactions=COUNT(tickers))` counts the number of transactions for each ticker symbol.
   - This creates a collection where each record contains a ticker symbol and the count of its buy transactions.

4. **Get top 2 tickers:**
   - `.TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` selects the top 2 tickers with the highest number of buy transactions.

5. **Final result:**
   - `result = top_2_tickers` assigns the result to a variable `result`, which will contain the ticker symbol and count for the top 2 most frequently bought tickers.

The query asks for customer signup statistics (PMCS) and transaction statistics (PMAT) for customers who signed up in the last 6 months excluding the current month. 

Let's break this down into sub-components:
1. Filter customers who signed up in the last 6 months excluding the current month.
2. Calculate PMCS (per month customer signups).
3. Calculate PMAT (per month average transaction amount).
4. Return the results.

# PyDough Implementation

## 1. Filter Customers
We need to filter customers who signed up in the last 6 months excluding the current month. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to find the number of months between the join date and the current date. We want customers where this difference is between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

```python
today = DATETIME('now')
six_months_ago = DATETIME(today, '-6 months')
filtered_customers = customers.WHERE(
    (join_date < today) & (join_date >= six_months_ago)
)
```

## 2. Calculate PMCS (Per Month Customer Signups)
To calculate PMCS, we need to group the filtered customers by the month they signed up in. We can use the `PARTITION` function to group customers by year and month of their join date.

```python
customer_months = PARTITION(filtered_customers, name=""customers_by_month"", by=(YEAR(join_date), MONTH(join_date)))
pmcs_data = customer_months.CALCULATE(
    year=YEAR(customers[0].join_date),
    month=MONTH(customers[0].join_date),
    pmcs=COUNT(customers_by_month)
)
```

## 3. Calculate PMAT (Per Month Average Transaction Amount)
We need to calculate the average transaction amount for each month. We can access the orders collection through the customers collection and calculate the average transaction amount. Note that we must access the `Transaction` collection via `transactions_made` because `transactions_made` is the plural version of this collection, while `transaction` is the singular version of the collection (as explained in the documentation):

```python
pmat_data = customer_months.CALCULATE(
    year=YEAR(customers[0].join_date),
    month=MONTH(customers[0].join_date),
    pmat=AVG(transactions_made.amount)
)
```

## 4. Combine Results
We can join the PMCS and PMAT data based on the year and month. First, we calculate the month key for both collections:

```python
pmcs_data = pmcs_data.CALCULATE(month_key=(year * 100 + month))
pmat_data = pmat_data.CALCULATE(month_key=(year * 100 + month))
```

Then, we can combine the results:

```python
result = pmcs_data.PARTITION(name=""pmcs"", by=month_key).CALCULATE(
    year=YEAR(pmcs[0].join_date),
    month=MONTH(pmcs[0].join_date),
    pmcs=pmcs[0].pmcs,
    pmat=AVG(pmat_data.WHERE(pmat_data.month_key == month_key).pmat)
).ORDER_BY(year.DESC(), month.DESC())
```

# Code Explanation

The code works by:
1. Filtering customers who signed up in the last 6 months (excluding the current month).
2. Grouping these customers by the month they signed up in.
3. Calculating the number of customers who signed up in each month (PMCS).
4. Calculating the average transaction amount for each month (PMAT).
5. Combining these results based on the year and month.
6. Sorting the final result by year and month in descending order.

# PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

1. **DATETIME**: Used to get the current date/time and to calculate the date 6 months ago.
2. **DATEDIFF**: Used to find the difference between two dates in months.
3. **PARTITION**: Used to group records by specified keys.
4. **CALCULATE**: Used to derive new fields or select specific fields.
5. **AVG**: Used to calculate the average value of a collection of numbers.
6. **COUNT**: Used to count the number of records in a collection.
7. **WHERE**: Used to filter records based on a condition.
8. **ORDER_BY**: Used to sort the results.

# Data Flow

The data flows through the following transformations:

1. Start with the `customers` collection.
2. Filter customers to include only those who signed up in the last 6 months (excluding the current month).
3. Group these customers by year and month.
4. Calculate PMCS (count of customers in each month).
5. Calculate PMAT (average transaction amount for each month).
6. Combine the results based on year and month.
7. Sort the final result by year and month in descending order.

This approach follows the hierarchical thinking model of PyDough by breaking down the problem into logical steps and transforming data at each step.

# PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Incremental Building**: The code builds the query in incremental steps, making it easier to understand and debug.
2. **Proper Naming**: The code uses descriptive variable names that indicate the purpose of each collection.
3. **Contextual Filtering**: The code filters data at the appropriate level of aggregation.
4. **Proper Handling of Subcollections**: The code correctly handles subcollections when calculating PMAT.
5. **Clear Logic Flow**: The code follows a logical flow that matches the requirements of the query.

The question asks for the average closing price (ACP) for each ticker type over the past 7 days, including today. The formula for ACP is defined as the average of the closing prices for each ticker within the last 7 days.

# Step-by-step explanation of the solution

1. **Calculate the date range:** We need to define the start date as 7 days ago from today. This can be done using the `DATETIME` function with appropriate date calculations.

2. **Filter data to include only the last 7 days:** We filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include records where the date is within the last 7 days from today.

3. **Partition data by ticker type:** We partition the filtered data by ticker type to group records for each type.

4. **Calculate the average closing price for each ticker type:** For each ticker type, we calculate the average of closing prices.

5. **Return the ticker type and average closing price:** We select the ticker type and the calculated average closing price for each group.

# The PyDough code

```python
from datetime import date, timedelta

today = date.today()
seven_days_ago = today - timedelta(days=6)  # Inclusive of today

recent_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= seven_days_ago).CALCULATE(
    ticker_id,
    date,
    close
)

ticker_types = recent_prices.PARTITION(name=""tickers"", by=ticker_id).CALCULATE(
    ticker_type = Tickers.WHERE(Tickers.key == ticker_id).CALCULATE(ticker_type).SINGULAR().ticker_type,
    average_close_price = AVG(tickers.close)
)

result = ticker_types.CALCULATE(
    ticker_type,
    average_close_price
)
```

# Explanation of how the code works

1. **Define date range**: We calculate the date range by getting today's date and subtracting 6 days to get a 7-day inclusive range.

2. **Filter recent prices**: We filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records within this date range. We also calculate the `ticker_id` since we will need this for the partition by.

3. **Partition by ticker type**: We group the filtered prices by ticker type using `PARTITION` with the `by` argument.

4. **Calculate average closing price**: For each ticker type, we calculate the average closing price using the `AVG` aggregation function. We also need to retrieve the ticker type from the Tickers collection using the `Tickers.WHERE(Tickers.key == ticker_id).SINGULAR().ticker_type` approach, ensuring the operation remains singular.

5. **Select final output**: We select the ticker type and its corresponding average closing price as the final result.

This approach addresses the original question by providing the average closing price for each ticker type over the past 7 days, inclusive of today.

# Comparison with examples from the provided documentation

    AR=(COUNT(cust_by_country.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)) / total_customers) * 100
)
```

## Explanation

The PyDough code calculates the Activity Ratio (AR) for each country by following these steps:

1. **Filter Customers**: The code starts by filtering customers who joined in the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)` and stores them in the `customers_2022` collection.

2. **Total Customer Count**: The total number of customers who joined in 2022 is calculated using `COUNT(customers_2022)` and stored in `total_customers`.

3. **Active Customer Count**: The code counts the number of customers who made transactions by filtering the `customers_2022` collection with `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)` and then counting them with `COUNT(customers_2022.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`.

4. **Country Grouping and AR Calculation**: The code groups the customers by country using `PARTITION(customers_2022, name=""cust_by_country"", by=country)` and calculates the Activity Ratio for each country by:
   - Counting the number of active customers in that country using `COUNT(cust_by_country.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`.
   - Dividing it by the total number of customers who joined in 2022 (`total_customers`).
   - Multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flows through these transformations:

1. Starting with the `Customers` collection
2. Filtering to keep only customers who joined in 2022
3. Counting the total number of these customers
4. Counting the number of these customers with transactions
5. Grouping these customers by country
6. Calculating the AR for each country as (active customers / total customers) * 100

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Proper use of PARTITION**: The code uses `PARTITION` correctly to group customers by country, allowing for aggregate calculations at the country level.

2. **Descriptive variable names**: The variables (`customers_2022`, `total_customers`, `active_customers`, `result`) are named descriptively, making the code easier to understand.

3. **Stepwise approach**: The code follows a logical sequence of steps: filter, count, group, calculate ratio. This makes the code readable and maintainable.

4. **Proper use of aggregate functions**: The code correctly uses `COUNT()` to count records and perform calculations on grouped data.

5. **Proper use of HAS()**: The code correctly uses `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` to check if a customer has at least one transaction.

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Collection and sub-collection access**: The code correctly accesses the `Customers` collection and its `transactions_made` sub-collection.

2. **Filtering with WHERE**: The code uses `WHERE()` for filtering records based on conditions.

3. **Aggregation with COUNT**: The code uses `COUNT()` for aggregation operations on collections.

4. **Grouping with PARTITION**: The code uses `PARTITION()` to group records by a specific field (country).

5. **Calculation with CALCULATE**: The code uses `CALCULATE()` to derive new fields from existing data.

6. **Logical operators**: The code uses the equality operator `==` for comparisons.

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the Activity Ratio (AR) for each country for customers who joined in 2022. The AR is defined as (Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100.

The code directly addresses this by:
1. Identifying customers who joined in 2022.
2. Counting the total number of customers who joined in 2022.
3. Counting the number of these customers who made transactions.

## Code Explanation

### PyDough-Specific Functions and Patterns Used

The code uses several PyDough-specific functions to achieve the customer search:

1. **CALCULATE**: This function is used twice in the code [7d3b717], first to create temporary fields with lowercase versions of names and states for case-insensitive matching, and then to select the customer attributes to be included in the final result. As noted in the documentation, ""CALCULATE is a core PyDough operation that can be used to derive new fields, rename existing ones, or select specific fields"" [7d3b717].

2. **LOWER**: This string function converts a string to lowercase [7d3b717]. It's used to perform case-insensitive comparisons for names and states.

3. **STARTSWITH**: This string function checks if a string starts with a specified substring [7d3b717]. It's used to find names that start with 'j'.

4. **ENDSWITH**: This string function checks if a string ends with a specified substring [7d3b717]. It's used to find names that end with 'ez' and states that end with 'a'.

5. **WHERE**: This filtering function filters the collection based on specified conditions [7d3b717]. In this case, it filters customers based on name and state criteria.

### Data Flow and Transformations

The code follows a clear data flow:

1. It starts with the `Customers` collection, which contains customer records.
2. It uses `CALCULATE` to create temporary fields with lowercase versions of names and states, making the subsequent filtering case-insensitive.
3. It uses `WHERE` to filter the collection to only include customers that meet both criteria: names starting with 'j' or ending with 'ez', and states ending with 'a'.
4. Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` again to select the specific customer attributes that should be included in the result.

This transformation pattern of first modifying data and then filtering it is a common PyDough approach.

### PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Concise filtering logic**: It uses the appropriate logical operators (& for AND and | for OR) for combining conditions [7d3b717].

2. **Case-insensitive matching**: By converting strings to lowercase, the code ensures that the search is case-insensitive as requested [7d3b717].

3. **Selectivity**: It explicitly specifies which customer attributes to include in the result, avoiding unnecessary data retrieval [7d3b717].

4. **Reusing transformation results**: It creates temporary variables (`selected_customers`) to store intermediate results, making the code more readable [988171e].

### How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for the number of customers who meet specific criteria: names starting with 'j' or ending with 'ez', and states ending with 'a'. The code addresses this by:

1. Creating temporary fields with lowercase versions of names and states to enable case-insensitive matching
2. Filtering customers based on the specified criteria using the `STARTSWITH`, `ENDSWITH`, and logical operators
3. Returning the customer attributes requested

### Similar Examples from the Search Results

A similar example from the search results [7d3b717] shows how to filter based on string patterns:

```python
People.CALCULATE(first_name, last_name, ssn_suffix=RIGHT(ssn, 4)).WHERE(
  (STARTSWITH(first_name, ""J"") == 1) | (ENDSWITH(last_name, ""s"") == 1) | (ssn_suffix == ""0000"")
)
```

Another relevant example [988171e] shows a customer filtering query:

```python
Customers.CALCULATE(customer_name = name).WHERE(state.endswith(""a"") == 1)
```

These examples demonstrate similar filtering patterns to the solution provided, with a focus on string comparisons and boolean logic.",8.255542278289795,"Customers.CALCULATE(customer_name = name).WHERE(state.endswith(""a"") == 1)","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=1095 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=1095)] prompt_token_count=18004 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=18004)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=19099 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

Code Context:
This code calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) for each ticker symbol from sell transactions in the past month. It first filters transactions to include only sell transactions from the current month and the previous month. Then, it groups these transactions by ticker symbol and calculates the SPM for each symbol using the provided formula.

Pydough Best Practices Demonstrated:
1. Using PARTITION to group data by a specific field (ticker symbol)
2. Using CALCULATE to derive new fields from aggregations (total_amount, total_tax, total_commission, spm)
3. Using WHERE to filter data based on conditions (transaction_type and date range)
4. Using datetime operations to calculate date ranges
5. Properly handling aggregations by using SUM() with the grouped collection
6. Clearly defining intermediate variables for readability (filtered_transactions, grouped_transactions)

Explanation:

1. **Data Preparation**: We start by extracting the ticker symbol from the `DailyPrices` collection, along with the year and month, and store the closing price.
2. **Partitioning and Aggregation**: We then partition the data by ticker symbol and month to calculate monthly aggregates like average closing price, maximum closing price, and minimum closing price.
3. **Using PREV**: We use the `PREV` function to get the previous month's average closing price for each ticker symbol. Note that we're using `month.ASC()` to define the sorting order within each ticker symbol. We set `default=0` to handle the first month of each ticker symbol where there is no previous month.
4. **Calculating MoMC**: Finally, we calculate the MoMC using the formula (avg_close_given_month - avg_close_previous_month) / avg_close_previous_month, ensuring that we handle cases where the previous month's closing price is 0 (to avoid division by zero errors).

)

Code Context:
The PyDough code answers the question about calculating ticker symbols, months, average closing prices, highest prices, lowest prices, and Month-over-Month (MoMC) change in average closing prices for each ticker by month.

Let me explain the important PyDough-specific functions and patterns used in this code:

1. **PARTITION Function**
The code uses the PARTITION function to group data by ticker symbol and month [e8b6c9d]:
ticker_months = PARTITION(month_data, name=""month_prices"", by=(symbol, month))
This creates logical partitions where operations can be performed on subsets of data rather than the entire collection.

2. **AVG Function**
The AVG function is used to calculate the average of closing prices [7d07d9c]:
avg_close=AVG(month_prices.close_price)
This aggregation function returns the average value of a numerical expression.

3. **MAX and MIN Functions**
The MAX and MIN functions find the maximum and minimum values of closing prices, respectively [7d07d9c]:
max_high=MAX(month_prices.close_price)
min_low=MIN(month_prices.close_price)

4. **LPAD Function**
The code uses the LPAD function to format month numbers with leading zeros [e8b6c9d]:
JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(date), LPAD(MONTH(date), 2, ""0""))
This ensures months are displayed with two digits, padding with zeros if needed.

5. **PREV Function**
The PREV function retrieves a value from a preceding record [a2304e6]:
prev_month_close=PREV(avg_close, by=month.ASC(), default=0)
This retrieves the average closing price from the previous month for each ticker.

6. **IF Function**
The code uses the IF function to conditionally calculate MoMC [e8b6c9d]:
MoMC=IF(prev_month_close != 0, (avg_close - prev_month_close) / prev_month_close, None)
This ensures division by zero is avoided when there's no previous month to compare against.

7. **JOIN_STRINGS Function**
The code uses the JOIN_STRINGS function to concatenate year and month [e8b6c9d]:
JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(date), LPAD(MONTH(date), 2, ""0""))
This creates a unique month identifier for partitioning and calculations.

PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated:

1. **Breaking down complex operations** [988171e]: The code breaks down the complex calculation into logical steps, making it easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Using PARTITION for hierarchical aggregation** [e8b6c9d]: The code correctly uses PARTITION to group data at different levels for calculations (first by symbol, then by symbol and month).

3. **Documenting code with comments** [988171e]: The code includes comments to explain each step and the purpose of specific operations.

4. **Handling edge cases** [e8b6c9d]: The code properly handles the edge case where there's no previous month to compare against by using default=0 with PREV and checking for zero values before performing division.

5. **Proper use of window functions** [a2304e6]: The code correctly uses PREV with a collation order (month.ASC()) to ensure proper ordering for calculations across months.

How the code follows PyDough conventions:

1. **Proper nesting of operations** [988171e]: The code follows the convention of chaining operations in a logical sequence, starting with data preparation and ending with the final result.

2. **Correct use of PARTITION with by keyword** [e8b6c9d]: The code uses the correct syntax for PARTITION, including the name and by keywords.

3. **Appropriate use of aggregation functions** [7d07d9c]: The code correctly uses AVG, MAX, and MIN to perform aggregations on groups of data.

4. **Proper use of PREV with collation** [a2304e6]: The code correctly uses the PREV function with a collation order to access values from previous records.

The code properly handles the requirement of retrieving specific fields (ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC) as requested in the original question. It follows PyDough's conventions for grouping data, performing calculations, and retrieving specific fields in the final result.",14.202200174331665,"# Step 1: Extract year and month from DailyPrices

1. **Analysis of the question**
The question asks to find the 3 distinct stocks that had the highest price change (difference between high and low prices) from April 1, 2023, to April 4, 2023. The result should include the ticker symbol and the price change.

2. **Step-by-step explanation of the solution**
   a. Filter the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023.
   b. Calculate the minimum low price and maximum high price for each stock in this range.
   c. Calculate the price change as the difference between the maximum high price and the minimum low price.
   d. Sort the stocks by price change in descending order.
   e. Select the top 3 stocks with the highest price change.
   f. For each selected stock, return the ticker symbol and the price change.

3. **The PyDough code in a Python code block**

```python
price_range = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (date >= ""2023-04-01"") & (date <= ""2023-04-04"")
).PARTITION(name=""days"", by=ticker_id).CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol,
    min_low=MIN(days.low),
    max_high=MAX(days.high)
)

results = price_range.CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol,
    price_change=max_high - min_low
).TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())
```

4. **Explanation of how the code works**

a. The code first filters the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023:
```python
DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (date >= ""2023-04-01"") & (date <= ""2023-04-04"")
)
```

b. Then it uses `PARTITION` to group these records by `ticker_id`, which means it's grouping all daily prices for the same stock:
```python
.PARTITION(name=""days"", by=ticker_id)
```

c. Inside the `PARTITION`, it calculates:
   - `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` field of the `ticker` sub-collection
   - `min_low` as the minimum value of the `low` prices across all days
   - `max_high` as the maximum value of the `high` prices across all days
```python
.CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol,
    min_low=MIN(days.low),
    max_high=MAX(days.high)
)
```

d. The code then calculates the price change as the difference between `max_high` and `min_low`:
```python
price_change=max_high - min_low
```

e. Finally, it selects the top 3 stocks with the highest price change using `TOP_K`:
```python
.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())
```

The final result (`results`) contains the ticker symbol and the price change for the top 3 stocks that had the highest price change between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023.

Pydough Code:
price_range = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (date >= ""2023-04-01"") & (date <= ""2023-04-04"")
).PARTITION(name=""days"", by=ticker_id).CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol,
    min_low=MIN(days.low),
    max_high=MAX(days.high)
)

results = price_range.CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol,
    price_change=max_high - min_low
).TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())

Code Context:
# Explanation of PyDough Code for Stock Price Change Analysis

The PyDough code provided answers the question ""Which 3 distinct stocks had the highest price change between the low and high from April 1 2023 to April 4 2023? I want the difference in the low and high throughout this timerange, not just the intraday price changes. Return the ticker symbol and price change.""

## PyDough Functions and Patterns Used

### 1. WHERE Function
The code uses the WHERE function to filter data based on date conditions:
```python
DailyPrices.WHERE((date >= ""2023-04-01"") & (date <= ""2023-04-04""))
```
As explained in the documentation [988171e]: ""The `.WHERE()` operation preserves only records where the expression evaluates to a truthy value."" In this case, it selects only those daily price records between April 1 and April 4, 2023.

### 2. PARTITION Function
The PARTITION function groups data by ticker_id:
```python
.PARTITION(name=""days"", by=ticker_id)
```
This creates a collection where daily prices are grouped by each ticker symbol. As noted in [8ad9e92]: ""PARTITION() is used to create a new collection by grouping records based on 1+ partitioning terms.""

### 3. CALCULATE Function
The code uses CALCULATE multiple times to define fields:
```python
.CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol,
    min_low=MIN(days.low),
    max_high=MAX(days.high)
)
```
And again later:
```python
.CALCULATE(
    ticker_symbol,
    price_change=max_high - min_low
)
```
CALCULATE is used to define new fields in a collection by evaluating expressions for each record [988171e]. Here it creates ticker_symbol, min_low, max_high, and price_change fields.

### 4. Aggregation Functions (MIN, MAX)
The code uses MIN and MAX functions to aggregate data across the date range:
```python
MIN(days.low)
MAX(days.high)
```
These aggregation functions reduce multiple values to a single value per group.

### 5. TOP_K Function
Finally, the code uses TOP_K to select the top 3 records with the highest price change:
```python
.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())
```
TOP_K selects the first K records from the collection, sorted by the specified expression [988171e]. The DESC() modifier indicates sorting in descending order.

## Data Flow and Transformations

The data flow in this code follows a clear transformation pipeline:

1. Start with `DailyPrices` collection
2. Filter to keep only records from April 1-4, 2023
3. Group the filtered data by ticker_id, creating a collection where each record corresponds to a unique ticker symbol
4. For each ticker symbol, calculate:
   - The ticker symbol itself (using `ticker.symbol`)
   - The minimum low price across all days in the date range
   - The maximum high price across all days in the date range
5. Create a new collection from this grouped data
6. For each ticker symbol in this new collection, calculate:
   - The price change (difference between max_high and min_low)
7. Sort these results by price change in descending order
8. Select only the top 3 records

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

The code demonstrates several PyDough best practices:

1. **Hierarchical thinking**: The code leverages PyDough's hierarchical model to navigate from DailyPrices to tickers [988171e].

2. **Incremental building**: The code builds the solution in logical steps - first filtering, then grouping, then calculating aggregates, then computing the final result [988171e].

3. **Meaningful variable names**: The code uses descriptive names like price_range and results that clearly indicate what each variable contains [988171e].

4. **Clear expression evaluation**: The code uses explicit expressions (like max_high - min_low) rather than assuming default behavior [988171e].

5. **Proper use of PARTITION**: The PARTITION operation is used appropriately to group data for aggregation [8ad9e92].

## How the Code Follows PyDough Conventions

The code follows PyDough conventions in several ways:

1. **Capitalized operations**: All PyDough operations (WHERE, PARTITION, CALCULATE, TOP_K) are capitalized [988171e].

2. **Chaining operations**: The code chains operations together in a logical sequence [988171e].

3. **Keyword argument naming**: The PARTITION operation uses the required 'name' and 'by' keyword arguments [8ad9e92].

4. **Expression context**: The code correctly accesses ticker.symbol from the DailyPrices context [988171e].

5. **Aggregation syntax**: The aggregation functions (MIN, MAX) are called correctly [988171e].

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""the 3 distinct stocks that had the highest price change between the low and high from April 1 2023 to April 4 2023."" The code directly addresses this by:

1. Filtering to exactly that date range (April 1-4, 2023)
2. Using MIN/MAX to find the lowest low and highest high across that range for each stock
3. Computing the price change as the difference between these extremes
4. Returning the top 3 stocks with the greatest price changes

The output will include both the ticker symbol and the computed price change, exactly as requested.

The approach of using PARTITION to group by ticker symbol is crucial to ensure that the aggregation is done correctly across all days in the specified range. Without this grouping, the MAX and MIN operations would not produce the correct results for each stock individually.",15.553258657455444,".TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=2280 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=2280)] prompt_token_count=18053 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=18053)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=20333 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"

Based on the provided documentation, here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the customer transaction query in PyDough:

### 1. Data Analysis and Requirements
The question asks to identify which customer made the highest number of transactions in the same month as they signed up. This requires:
- Extracting the signup month from the customer's join_date
- For each customer, counting the transactions that occurred in their signup month
- Finding the customer with the maximum transaction count

### 2. PyDough Functions and Patterns Used
From the documentation, we can identify relevant functions:
- `YEAR()` and `MONTH()`: Extract year and month from dates
- `PARTITION()`: Groups records by specified keys
- `CALCULATE()`: Creates new fields or selects specific fields
- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of records in a collection
- `TOP_K()`: Selects the top k records based on a sorting criterion

### 3. Step-by-Step Code Explanation
```python
customers_info = Customers.CALCULATE(
    customer_id=_id,
    name=name,
    signup_year=YEAR(join_date),
    signup_month=MONTH(join_date)
)

customers_with_trans = customers_info.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made))

transactions_in_signup_month = Transactions.WHERE(
    AND(
        YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(customer.join_date),
        MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(customer.join_date)
    )
)

customer_transaction_counts = customers_with_trans.CALCULATE(
    customer_id=_id,
    total_transactions=COUNT(transactions_in_signup_month.customer_id)
)

top_customer = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(1, by=total_transactions.DESC())

result = top_customer.CALCULATE(
    customer_id,
    name,
    total_transactions
)
```

### 4. Data Flow and Transformations
The code follows a logical flow of data transformation:
1. First, extracts signup year and month from Customers collection
2. Filters customers to only include those who have transactions
3. Filters transactions to only include those from the customer's signup month
4. Counts how many transactions each customer made in their signup month
5. Selects the customer with the highest transaction count
6. Returns the customer's ID, name, and transaction count

### 5. PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated
The code demonstrates several best practices:
- Breaking down complex queries into logical steps
- Using CALCULATE to derive new fields from existing ones
- Using PARTITION to group data (although this example doesn't directly use PARTITION, it could be used if needed)
- Using TOP_K to get a specific number of records based on sorting
- Using descriptive variable names
- Using comments to explain complex filtering conditions

### 6. How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions
The code follows PyDough conventions by:
- Using collection.CALCULATE() to derive new fields
- Using collection.WHERE() to filter records
- Using `HAS()` to check for existence of subcollections
- Using TOP_K() with a sorting criterion
- Using expression.DESC() to specify descending sort order
- Using UPPER() to normalize string comparisons

**Analysis:**
1. We need to access customer data.
2. For each customer, calculate the total transaction amount (sum of all transaction amounts).
3. Sort customers by total transaction amount in descending order.
4. Select the top 5 customers.
5. Return their name and total transaction amount.

```

**Explanation:**

1. We start with the `Customers` collection, which contains customer information.
2. We use the `CALCULATE` function to derive:
   - The customer's name from the `name` field.
   - The total transaction amount for each customer using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)`. This sums the amount of all transactions made by each customer.
3. We use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 5 customers based on their `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (`DESC()`).

2. We filter the Transactions collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified date range using the WHERE clause.
3. We partition the filtered transactions by transaction_type using PARTITION and calculate:
   - The transaction type (grouping key)
   - The count of distinct customer IDs for each transaction type using NDISTINCT
   - The average number of shares for each transaction type using AVG

    customer_id=customer_id
).PARTITION(name=""distinct_customers"", by=customer_id).CALCULATE(
    customer_id=customer_id
)
```

## Explanation

The PyDough code answers the question ""Return the distinct list of customer IDs who have made a 'buy' transaction"" by performing the following steps:

1. **Filter for Customers with Transactions:**
   - `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)` filters the Customers collection to only include those who have made at least one transaction. This uses the `HAS` function to check for the existence of records in the related `transactions_made` sub-collection.
   - This leverages the one-to-many relationship between Customers and Transactions, where each customer can have multiple transactions.

2. **Select Customer IDs:**
   - `.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)` selects only the customer_id field from the filtered customers. This creates a collection containing only the customer IDs of customers who have made transactions.

3. **Ensure Distinct Values:**
   - `.PARTITION(name=""distinct_customers"", by=customer_id)` partitions the collection by customer_id, grouping all transactions by unique customer ID.
   - `.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)` creates a final collection with distinct customer IDs.

## PyDough Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Using HAS for Existence Check:** The code correctly uses the `HAS` function to check for the existence of records in a related sub-collection, which is a recommended pattern in PyDough.

2. **Hierarchical Thinking:** The code demonstrates hierarchical thinking by navigating from the Customers collection to its related Transactions sub-collection.

3. **Proper Use of PARTITION:** The code uses `PARTITION` appropriately to ensure distinct values in the result.

4. **Clear Variable Naming:** The variable name `distinct_customer_ids` clearly indicates the purpose of the collection.

## How This Code Follows PyDough Conventions

1. **Collection Access:** The code starts with the Customers collection, which follows the convention of accessing collections at the top level of the data model.

2. **Filtering with WHERE:** The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on a condition, following PyDough's convention for filtering operations.

3. **Projection with CALCULATE:** The `CALCULATE` clause is used to select specific fields from the collection, following PyDough's convention for field projection.

4. **Sub-collection Access:** The code accesses the related Transactions sub-collection using dot notation (`Customers.transactions_made`), which is the standard PyDough convention for accessing sub-collections.

## How the Code Addresses the Original Question

The original question asks for ""Return the distinct list of customer IDs who have made a 'buy' transaction."" The code addresses this by:

1. Starting with the Customers collection
2. Filtering to only include customers who have made transactions (checking for the existence of records in the transactions_made sub-collection)
3. Selecting only the customer IDs from these customers
4. Ensuring that the list of customer IDs is distinct by using PARTITION
5. Returning the collection of distinct customer IDs

This approach is simpler and more direct than alternatives that might involve joins or complex aggregation functions in traditional SQL-like databases.",5.9395973682403564,"distinct_customer_ids = Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

The question asks for a distinct list of ticker IDs that have daily price records on or after April 1, 2023. This involves filtering the `DailyPrices` collection by date and then extracting the distinct ticker IDs.

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2. Filter the collection to include only records with `date` on or after April 1, 2023.
3. Use `CALCULATE` to extract the `ticker_id` field.
4. Use `DISTINCT()` to get a list of unique ticker IDs.

## PyDough code in a Python code block

```python
result = DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= datetime.date(2023, 4, 1)).CALCULATE(ticker_id).DISTINCT(ticker_id)
```

## Explanation of how the code works

The code first filters the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records with `date` on or after April 1, 2023. Then, it uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `ticker_id` field from the filtered collection. Finally, it uses `DISTINCT(ticker_id)` to get a list of unique ticker IDs from the filtered collection.

This code follows the PyDough best practices by:
1. Starting with the appropriate collection (`DailyPrices`).
2. Using `WHERE` for filtering.
3. Using `CALCULATE` to extract specific fields.
4. Using `DISTINCT()` to ensure uniqueness.
5. Storing the result in a variable (`result`).",3.349027633666992,"result = DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= datetime.date(2023, 4, 1)).CALCULATE(ticker_id).DISTINCT(ticker_id)","cache_tokens_details=None cached_content_token_count=None candidates_token_count=346 candidates_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=346)] prompt_token_count=17989 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=17989)] thoughts_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=18335 traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>"
