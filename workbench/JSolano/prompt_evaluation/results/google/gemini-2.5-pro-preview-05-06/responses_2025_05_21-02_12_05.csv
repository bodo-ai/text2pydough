).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer that meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the customer and assigns it to `customer_name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express the rate as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.

The query effectively identifies customers with a minimum transaction volume and then computes and orders them by their transaction success rate.",20.850990772247314,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`**:
    This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols`, which stores the ticker symbols for FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to read.

2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    This part of the query starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these customers based on two conditions combined with a logical AND (`&`):
    *   **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`**:
        *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions made by each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: This filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (the symbol of the stock involved in the transaction) is one of the symbols listed in the `faang_symbols` tuple (i.e., ""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", or ""NFLX"").
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the customer has at least one transaction that matches the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., at least one FAANG stock transaction).

    The `filtered_customers` variable will hold the collection of customers who satisfy both the email condition and the FAANG stock transaction condition.

3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_distinct_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result at the `Broker` (top) level.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: This aggregation function counts the number of distinct customers present in the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `num_distinct_customers = ...`: The result of the count is assigned to a new field named `num_distinct_customers`.

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined on or after January 1, 2023, and whose status is 'Active'. The `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` function is used to ensure the comparison includes the entire day of January 1, 2023, by setting the time to the beginning of the day.
2.  Partition these filtered customers by their `country`. This groups the customers based on their country of origin.
3.  For each country group, calculate the `country` and the count of customers within that group. This count represents the TAC for that specific country. The `COUNT(Customers)` function is used here to count the customers in each partition.

**Explanation:**

    *   `join_date >= DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")`: This condition selects customers whose join date is on or after January 1, 2023. `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` creates a datetime value for the beginning of January 1, 2023, ensuring accurate comparison even if `join_date` includes a time component.
    *   `status == ""Active""`: This condition further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers meeting both criteria are selected.
*   `result = active_customers_on_or_after_2023.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered customers and partitions them.
    *   `name=""country_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition, which is good practice but not directly used in this specific `CALCULATE` clause.

1.  **Augment Transaction Data**: For each transaction, we'll calculate:
    *   `relative_week_num`: An identifier for the week it belongs to, relative to the current week. `1` will represent last week, `2` the week before last, and so on. This is calculated by finding the difference in weeks between the start of the transaction's week and the start of the current week.
    *   `is_weekend_tx`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Relevant Transactions**: We'll filter these augmented transactions to include only those from the last 8 weeks (i.e., `relative_week_num` from 1 to 8).

3.  **Group and Aggregate**: We'll group the filtered transactions by `relative_week_num` and then, for each week:
    *   Identify the week (using `relative_week_num` and also calculating the actual start date of that week for clarity).
    *   Count the total number of transactions.
    *   Count the number of transactions that occurred on a weekend.

4.  **Order Results**: The results will be ordered from the most recent week (last week, `relative_week_num = 1`) to the oldest of the 8 weeks considered (`relative_week_num = 8`).

It's assumed that all transactions in the `Transactions` table are related to stocks, as they have a `ticker_id` linking them to the `Tickers` table.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate relative week number and weekend flag for each transaction
transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(
    tx_date_time = date_time,  # Store original date_time for later use
    # Calculate how many weeks ago the transaction's week was compared to the current week.

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step processes each transaction from the `Transactions` table.
    *   `tx_date_time = date_time`: Preserves the original `date_time` of the transaction.
    *   `relative_week_num = DATEDIFF(""weeks"", DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week'), DATETIME('now', 'start of week'))`: This calculates an integer representing how many full weeks ago the transaction's week occurred relative to the start of the current week. For example, `0` means the transaction was in the current week, `1` means it was last week, `2` means the week before last, and so on.
    *   `is_weekend_tx = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean flag that is `True` if the transaction's `date_time` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.

2.  **`relevant_transactions = transactions_with_week_info.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the augmented transactions to keep only those where `relative_week_num` is between `1` and `8` (inclusive). This effectively selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.

3.  **`weekly_stock_summary = relevant_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(relative_week_num))`: This groups the `relevant_transactions` based on their `relative_week_num`. Each group will contain all transactions for one specific week out of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = relative_week_num`: This is the numeric identifier for the week (1-8).
        *   `week_start_date = DATETIME(MIN(Transactions.tx_date_time), 'start of week')`: This calculates the actual start date of the respective week by taking the earliest transaction time within that group and truncating it to the start of its week. This provides a more user-friendly representation of the week.
        *   `total_transactions_this_week = COUNT(Transactions)`: This counts the total number of transactions in the current weekly group.
        *   `weekend_transactions_this_week = SUM(IFF(Transactions.is_weekend_tx, 1, 0))`: This counts how many transactions within the current weekly group had the `is_weekend_tx` flag set to `True`. The `IFF` function converts the boolean `is_weekend_tx` to `1` (if true) or `0` (if false), and `SUM` adds these up.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.ASC())`: This sorts the final results by the `week_identifier` in ascending order, so the most recent week (last week, identifier 1) appears first, followed by progressively older weeks up to the 8th week ago.

4.  **`result = weekly_stock_summary`**:
    *   The final result is assigned to the variable `result`. It will contain a table with columns: `week_identifier`, `week_start_date`, `total_transactions_this_week`, and `weekend_transactions_this_week` for each of the last 8 weeks (excluding the current week).",61.4168701171875,"# Step 1: Calculate relative week number and weekend flag for each transaction

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of last week. This is done by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), finding the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and then subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
        *   `_start_of_current_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week, which serves as the exclusive end boundary for last week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` clause builds upon the first one:
        *   It accesses `Customers` from the `Broker` collection.
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")` filters these customers to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made` then accesses all transactions made by these US-based customers.
        *   Another `.WHERE(...)` clause filters these transactions based on their `date_time`:
            *   `date_time >= _start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of last week.
            *   `date_time < _start_of_current_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current week.
        *   The result of this filtering is assigned to a temporary variable `_filtered_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   The third `CALCULATE` clause takes the `_filtered_transactions` collection:
        *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(_filtered_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions that met all the criteria.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these filtered transactions.

The final result, `last_week_transactions_summary`, will be a collection with a single row containing two columns: `number_of_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`, representing the requested data for customers from the USA for transactions made last week.",23.18750786781311,"# Define the start and end dates for ""last week""

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name`.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` for each customer).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Select the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`.
        *   Rename `total_trans_amount` to `total_transaction_amount` for the final output.
        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (CR).
            *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank to each customer.
            *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` field in descending order. This means the customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1.

The final `result` will be a collection where each record represents a customer and includes their name, total number of transactions, total transaction amount, and their rank (CR) based on the total transaction amount.",21.12628746032715,"customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(

1.  Access the `Transactions` collection and for each transaction, retrieve its ticker symbol (from the related `Tickers` collection), its date and time, and its type.
2.  Filter these transactions to include only those that are of type ""BUY"" and occurred within the last 10 days from the current moment.
3.  Group the filtered transactions by their ticker symbol.
4.  For each ticker symbol group, count the number of buy transactions.
5.  Select the top 2 ticker symbols based on this count, in descending order.
6.  The final result will include the ticker symbol and the corresponding number of buy transactions.

This PyDough code first prepares the transaction data by extracting the ticker symbol and relevant fields. It then filters these transactions to isolate ""BUY"" operations within the last 10 days. After filtering, it groups the transactions by ticker symbol and counts the occurrences in each group.
