).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer that meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the customer and assigns it to `customer_name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express the rate as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.

The query effectively identifies customers with a minimum transaction volume and then computes and orders them by their transaction success rate.",21.43462324142456,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`**:
    This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols`, which stores the ticker symbols for FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to read.

2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    This part of the query starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these customers based on two conditions combined with a logical AND (`&`):
    *   **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`**:
        *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions made by each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: This filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (the symbol of the stock involved in the transaction) is one of the symbols listed in the `faang_symbols` tuple (i.e., ""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", or ""NFLX"").
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the customer has at least one transaction that matches the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., at least one FAANG stock transaction).

    The `filtered_customers` variable will hold the collection of customers who satisfy both the email condition and the FAANG stock transaction condition.

3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_distinct_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result at the `Broker` (top) level.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: This aggregation function counts the number of distinct customers present in the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `num_distinct_customers = ...`: The result of the count is assigned to a new field named `num_distinct_customers`.

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined on or after January 1, 2023, and whose status is 'Active'. The `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` function is used to ensure the comparison includes the entire day of January 1, 2023, by setting the time to the beginning of the day.
2.  Partition these filtered customers by their `country`. This groups the customers based on their country of origin.
3.  For each country group, calculate the `country` and the count of customers within that group. This count represents the TAC for that specific country. The `COUNT(Customers)` function is used here to count the customers in each partition.

```
**Explanation:**

*   `active_customers_on_or_after_2023 = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `join_date >= DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")`: This condition selects customers whose join date is on or after January 1, 2023. `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` creates a datetime value for the beginning of January 1, 2023, ensuring accurate comparison even if `join_date` includes a time component.
    *   `status == ""Active""`: This condition further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers meeting both criteria are selected.
*   `result = active_customers_on_or_after_2023.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered customers and partitions them.
    *   `name=""country_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition, which is good practice but not directly used in this specific `CALCULATE` clause.
    *   `by=(country)`: Specifies that the customers should be grouped by the `country` field.
*   `.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`: This line calculates the desired output for each group created by the `PARTITION`.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the relevant 8-week period. This period starts 56 days (8 weeks) before the beginning of the current week and ends just before the current week begins.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that:
    *   Are for ""stock"" tickers. We'll assume the `ticker_type` field in the `Tickers` collection is 'stock' for this purpose.
    *   Fall within the defined 8-week time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected transaction, we calculate a standardized week identifier (`week_start_iso`). This is the start date of the week the transaction belongs to, formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD"" for clear grouping and sorting.
4.  **Group by Week**: We partition (group) these transactions by the `week_start_iso`.
5.  **Calculate Counts per Week**: For each week group:
    *   `total_stock_txns`: We count all transactions belonging to that group.
    *   `weekend_stock_txns`: We count transactions within that group where the `date_time` falls on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", determined using the `DAYNAME()` function.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by the week identifier in descending order, showing the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `start_of_current_week` and `eight_weeks_ago_from_start_of_current_week`: These lines define the boundaries for our 8-week analysis period, ensuring we exclude the current week.
2.  `transactions_for_partitioning`:
    *   This variable holds transactions that meet our initial criteria:
        *   `Transactions.ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Filters for transactions related to stocks. (Note: The actual value for 'stock' in `ticker_type` might vary, e.g., ""STK"", ""Equity"". ""stock"" is assumed here).
        *   The `date_time` conditions ensure transactions are within the desired 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these transactions, it computes `week_start_iso`.
        *   `DATETIME(Transactions.date_time, 'start of week')` truncates the transaction's timestamp to the start of its week.
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` are used to format this week-start-date into a ""YYYY-MM-DD"" string, which serves as a unique identifier for each week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=(week_start_iso))`: This groups the `transactions_for_partitioning` by the `week_start_iso`. Each group represents one of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = week_start_iso`: Selects the week identifier.
        *   `total_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions within that specific week's group. `Transactions` here refers to the records from the base `Transactions` collection that fall into the current partition group and meet the initial filtering criteria.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(Transactions.date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts transactions within the current week's group where the `DAYNAME()` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.DESC())`: Sorts the weekly summaries, showing the most recent week first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `start_of_current_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: This determines the exact timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday at 00:00:00).
    *   `start_of_last_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: This calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week immediately preceding the current week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   `relevant_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: It selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"". This is achieved by navigating from the `Transactions` collection to the linked `Customers` collection via the `customer` field and then accessing the `country` attribute.
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week_dt) & (date_time < start_of_current_week_dt)`: This ensures that only transactions whose `date_time` falls within the last week are included. The period starts from `start_of_last_week_dt` (inclusive) and ends just before `start_of_current_week_dt` (exclusive), covering the entire previous week.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates**:
    *   `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: The final aggregation is performed at the `Broker` (top) level, producing a single result row.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(relevant_transactions)`: This counts the number of transactions that met the filtering criteria.

        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name`.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` for each customer).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Select the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`.
        *   Rename `total_trans_amount` to `total_transaction_amount` for the final output.

            *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank to each customer.
            *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` field in descending order. This means the customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1.

2.  Group the tickers by their `ticker_type` using the `PARTITION` function. This creates distinct groups for each unique ticker type.
3.  For each `ticker_type` group, calculate the average closing price:
    *   Access the `historical_prices` for all tickers within the current `ticker_type` group.
    *   Filter these `historical_prices` to include only records where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') < 7`.

        *   A value of 0 means the price is from today.
        *   A value of 6 means the price is from 7 days ago.
        *   The condition `< 7` includes dates from 0 to 6 days ago.
    *   From these filtered daily prices, take the `close` (closing price).

1.  **Filter Customers by Join Year**: Select only customers who joined in the year 2022.
2.  **Determine Transaction Status and Activity Status**: For these selected customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), False otherwise.
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's status is 'Active' (`status == 'Active'`), False otherwise.
3.  **Group by Country**: Partition the customers (with their flags) by their `country`.
4.  **Calculate Counts for AR**: For each country group:
    *   `num_active_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022, are 'Active', AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022 AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: Apply the formula: `AR = (num_active_with_transactions / num_total_with_transactions) * 100.0`. If `num_total_with_transactions` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.

    )

result = activity_ratio_by_country
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_with_flags`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)` filters these customers to include only those who joined in 2022.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then processes these filtered customers to:
        *   Extract the `country` and assign it to `customer_country`.
        *   Create a boolean flag `has_transactions_flag`, which is true if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
        *   Create a boolean flag `is_active_flag`, which is true if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.

2.  `ar_components_by_country`:
    *   This step takes `customers_joined_2022_with_flags` and partitions them by `customer_country` using `PARTITION(name=""customers_in_country_group"", by=(customer_country))`. Each group, named `customers_in_country_group`, contains customers from the same country who joined in 2022, along with their calculated flags.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(...)` operates on each country group:
        *   `output_country_name = customer_country`: Selects the country name for the group.
        *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who are both active (`is_active_flag` is true) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the numerator for the AR.
        *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the denominator for the AR.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the per-country counts from the previous step.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio.
        *   It checks if `num_total_with_transactions` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.
        *   If it is, AR is calculated as `(num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions`.
        *   Otherwise (if `num_total_with_transactions` is 0), AR is set to `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the top-level `Broker` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers = COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_customers` that will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is applied to the `name` and `state` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name starts with 'j'.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`(... | ...)`**: The OR operator `|` combines the two name conditions, meaning a customer is selected if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
8.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
9.  **`(... & ...)`**: The AND operator `&` combines the name condition (the OR group) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.
10. **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` tallies the number of `Customers` records that satisfy all the specified conditions.",16.28957200050354,"count_of_customers = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and create a working version with aliased fields for clarity, including the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), transaction date/time, type, amount, tax, and commission.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions within the specified date range. ""Past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" is interpreted as the period from the start of the calendar month that was one month ago, up to the current date and time. For example, if today is July 15th, this range would be from June 1st to July 15th. This is achieved using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month', 'start of month')` for the start date and `DATETIME('now')` for the end date.
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: Partition the filtered sell transactions by their ticker symbol. This allows us to perform aggregations for each ticker.
4.  **Aggregate Financials per Ticker**: For each ticker group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_sell_amount` by summing the `amount` of sell transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_tax` by summing the `tax` associated with these transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_commission` by summing the `commission` for these transactions.
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values for each ticker, calculate the SPM with the provided formula:
    `SPM = (Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`
    This translates to:
    `SPM = (total_sell_amount - (total_tax + total_commission)) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`
    We will handle cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to 0.0 in such instances.
6.  **Format Output**: Select and return only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM` for each ticker.

For each group, calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price. This results in a collection where each row represents one month of data for a specific ticker.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC Calculation**: Take the monthly aggregated data and group it by ticker symbol. This creates series of monthly data for each ticker.
4.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: Within each ticker's monthly series, use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month. This requires ordering the data by year and month.
5.  **Calculate MoMC**: Compute the MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - previous_month_avg_close) / previous_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker) or zero to avoid errors.

Explanation:
The query is constructed in several stages:
1.  `daily_price_details`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices` and calculate necessary attributes for each record: the ticker symbol (`ticker_sym_field` from the related `ticker` object), the year (`price_year_field`), and month (`price_month_field`) of the price date, along with the closing, high, and low prices.
2.  `monthly_aggregates`: This step takes `daily_price_details` and partitions it by `ticker_sym_field`, `price_year_field`, and `price_month_field`. For each unique combination (i.e., for each ticker each month), it calculates the average closing price (`avg_c`), maximum high price (`max_h`), and minimum low price (`min_l`). The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a specific ticker.
3.  `result_with_prev_close`: This is a crucial step for calculating the Month-over-Month Change (MoMC).
    *   It takes `monthly_aggregates` and partitions it again, this time only by the ticker symbol (`ticker_s`). This groups all monthly records for each ticker together.
    *   The expression `.ticker_series_group.monthly_aggregates` accesses the series of monthly aggregate records belonging to the current ticker group.
    *   On this per-ticker monthly series, we use `CALCULATE` to pass through the existing monthly stats (`ticker_s_calc`, `year_m_calc`, `month_m_calc`, `avg_c_calc`, `max_h_calc`, `min_l_calc`).
    *   Crucially, it calculates `prev_avg_c_val` using the `PREV(avg_c, by=(year_m.ASC(), month_m.ASC()), per=""ticker_series_group"")` function. This function looks up the `avg_c` (average closing price) from the previous record within the same ticker's data, ordered by year and month. The `per=""ticker_series_group""` ensures that the `PREV` function resets for each new ticker.
4.  `final_ticker_monthly_performance`: The final `CALCULATE` step takes the output from `result_with_prev_close` and:
    *   Formats the month into ""YYYY-MM"" string using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD`.
    *   Selects the required fields: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, and `lowest_price`.
    *   Calculates `MoMC` using the current month's average closing price (`avg_c_calc`) and the previous month's average closing price (`prev_avg_c_val`). The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_avg_c_val` is `None` (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker) or zero, setting MoMC to `None` in such scenarios to prevent errors.

The final result, `final_ticker_monthly_performance`, will contain one row for each ticker for each month, including all the requested financial metrics. The data will be implicitly ordered by ticker symbol, then by year and month due to the partitioning and `PREV` function's ordering.",130.00119376182556,"# Step 1: Prepare daily data with necessary fields (ticker symbol, year, month, close, high, low)

2.  From these filtered records, create an intermediate collection by calculating/extracting the ticker symbol (from the related `Tickers` table via `DailyPrices.ticker.symbol`), the high price, and the low price.
3.  Partition this intermediate collection by the ticker symbol. This groups all price records for the same stock together.
4.  For each stock group (i.e., for each distinct ticker symbol):
    a.  Calculate the maximum high price (`max_h`) observed for that stock within the date range.
    b.  Calculate the minimum low price (`min_l`) observed for that stock within the date range.
5.  Calculate the price difference as `max_h - min_l` for each stock.
6.  Use `TOP_K` to select the 3 stocks with the largest price difference, ordered in descending order.
7.  Finally, select the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `price_change` for these top 3 stocks.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_month_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `CALCULATE` method is used to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_identifier=_id`: Selects the customer's `_id` and renames it to `customer_identifier`.
        *   `customer_name_val=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name_val`.
        *   `transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions a customer made in the same calendar month and year they joined.
            *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It filters the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
            *   The `WHERE` clause condition `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))` ensures that only transactions where the transaction's year and month match the customer's `join_date` year and month are considered.
            *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts these filtered transactions.

2.  **`highest_transaction_customer = customer_join_month_transactions.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the result from the previous step (`customer_join_month_transactions`).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This selects the top 1 customer based on the `transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order. This effectively finds the customer with the highest number of transactions in their join month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` formats the output to return only the requested fields:
        *   `_id=customer_identifier`: The customer's ID.
        *   `name=customer_name_val`: The customer's name.

    *   `total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: For each customer, we calculate the sum of the `amount` from all their associated transactions (accessed via the `transactions_made` sub-collection). This sum is aliased as `total_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions by Date:**
    *   The query starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It uses a `WHERE` clause to select transactions where the `date_time` falls between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, inclusive. This is achieved by checking if the `YEAR` is 2023 and the `MONTH` is between 1 (January) and 3 (March).

2.  **Group by Transaction Type and Calculate Metrics:**
    *   The filtered transactions (`transactions_in_range`) are then partitioned by `transaction_type` using the `PARTITION` function. This creates groups of transactions for each unique type.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`):
        *   `CALCULATE` is used to compute the required metrics:
            *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction (this is the partitioning key).
            *   `number_of_distinct_customers`: Calculated using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`. This counts the unique `customer_id` values among the transactions belonging to the current type and date range.
            *   `average_number_of_shares`: Calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`. This computes the average of the `shares` field for transactions of the current type and date range.

3.  **Select Top 3 Transaction Types:**
    *   The `TOP_K` function is applied to the result of the partitioning and calculation (`grouped_by_transaction_type`).
    *   It selects the top 3 transaction types, ordered in descending order (`DESC()`) based on the `number_of_distinct_customers`.

4.  **Final Result:**
    *   The variable `result` holds the final output, which will contain up to 3 rows, each corresponding to a transaction type, and including the transaction type itself, the count of distinct customers who made that type of transaction in the given period, and the average number of shares for those transactions.",50.67059350013733,"# Filter transactions to include only those within the specified date range:

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection, as each entry in this collection represents a unique customer.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction of type 'buy'. We can use the `HAS` function to check the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
    *   Inside `HAS`, we filter `transactions_made` for records where `transaction_type == 'buy'`.
3.  For the customers who meet this criterion, select their `_id` field, which is the customer's unique identifier.
4.  Rename the `_id` field to `customer_id` in the output as requested.

This approach ensures distinctness because we are iterating over the `Customers` collection, and each customer appears only once.

**Explanation:**

    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions associated with each customer.

2.  Filter these records to include only those where the `date` field is greater than or equal to '2023-04-01'.
3.  Group the filtered records by `ticker_id` to ensure distinctness. This can be achieved using the `PARTITION` function.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= ""2023-04-01"")`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection and then filters it. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those records where the `date` is on or after April 1, 2023. We assume the `date` field can be directly compared with the string ""2023-04-01"".
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""unique_tickers_by_id"", by=(ticker_id))`: After filtering, the `PARTITION` function is used to group the remaining `DailyPrices` records. It groups them by the `ticker_id` field. This effectively creates a group for each unique `ticker_id` present in the filtered data.
3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is applied to the result of the partitioning. For each unique group (representing a distinct `ticker_id`), it selects the `ticker_id` itself. The field `ticker_id` is directly used as it's the partitioning key.

tickers_without_daily_prices = Tickers.WHERE(HASNOT(historical_prices) == 1).CALCULATE(
    ticker_id=_id,
    ticker_symbol=symbol
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers`**: We start by accessing the `Tickers` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(historical_prices) == 1)`**: This filters the `Tickers` collection.
    *   `historical_prices` is the sub-collection containing daily price records for each ticker.
    *   `HASNOT(historical_prices)` checks if this sub-collection is empty (i.e., the ticker has no daily price records).
    *   `== 1` ensures we only keep tickers where `HASNOT(historical_prices)` is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id, ticker_symbol=symbol)`**: For the tickers that satisfy the `WHERE` condition, this step selects and renames the desired fields:
    *   `ticker_id=_id`: Selects the `_id` field and renames it to `ticker_id`.
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the `symbol` field and renames it to `ticker_symbol`.

The `tickers_without_daily_prices` variable will then hold the list of ticker IDs and symbols for tickers that do not have any entries in their `historical_prices`.",6.249484062194824,"tickers_without_daily_prices = Tickers.WHERE(HASNOT(historical_prices) == 1).CALCULATE(

    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with that ticker. This can be obtained using `SUM(transactions_of.amount)`.
3.  We also need to select the `symbol` of the ticker.
4.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 10 tickers based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, we calculate three new fields:
        *   `country_of_customer`: Retrieves the country of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.country`).
        *   `transaction_amount_val`: Stores the transaction's `amount`.
        *   `transaction_datetime`: Stores the transaction's `date_time`. This is done to use it in the subsequent `WHERE` clause.

2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now') <= 30)`**:
    *   This filters the transactions, keeping only those that occurred within the last 30 days.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's date/time and the current moment.
    *   The condition `<= 30` ensures we include transactions from today (0 days ago) up to and including 30 days ago.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country_of_customer))`**:
    *   The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by the `country_of_customer`.
    *   Each group, named `country_groups` internally, will contain all transactions from a specific country that occurred in the last 30 days.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each country group created by the `PARTITION` step, we calculate:
        *   `country_name`: This is the `country_of_customer` for the current group.
        *   `num_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`) within the current country group. `Transactions` here refers to the sub-collection of transactions belonging to this specific country after filtering.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: This sums the `transaction_amount_val` for all transactions (`SUM(Transactions.transaction_amount_val)`) within the current country group.

1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these prices to include only those for the ticker symbol 'VTI'.
3.  Further filter these prices to include only those from the last 7 days. We can achieve this by calculating the difference in days between the price's `date` and the current date using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` and ensuring this difference is less than or equal to 6 (to cover today and the 6 previous days, making a total of 7 days).

2.  For these filtered transactions, create a formatted string representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") to be used for grouping.
3.  Partition the filtered transactions by this year-month string.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction price.
5.  The result will show each month in Q1 2023 (that has successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price.

).CALCULATE(
    month = year_month_str,
    avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions that occurred in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitutes the first quarter.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year_month_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(date_time), LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")))`: For each filtered transaction, this creates a new field `year_month_str`.
        *   `YEAR(date_time)` extracts the year.
        *   `MONTH(date_time)` extracts the month number.
        *   `LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")` pads the month number with a leading zero if it's a single digit (e.g., 1 becomes ""01"").
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ...)` combines the year and padded month with a hyphen, creating a string like ""2023-01"".

2.  `monthly_average_prices = q1_2023_successful_transactions.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered and prepared transactions and partitions them.
    *   `name=""monthly_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` field names here, it's part of the syntax).
    *   `by=(year_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of `year_month_str`. This means all transactions for ""2023-01"" will be in one group, ""2023-02"" in another, and so on.

3.  `.CALCULATE(month = year_month_str, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `month = year_month_str`: Selects the `year_month_str` (which represents the month) for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the items in the `monthly_group` partition, which originate from the `Transactions` collection.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result by the month in ascending order (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02"", ""2023-03"").

The 8-week period will start 56 days (8 weeks) before the current week's start and end just before the current week's start.
2.  **Identify High-Value Sales Payments**: Filter the `Sales` collection for records where `sale_price` is over $30,000. Then, access the associated `payment` records (which are `PaymentsReceived`).
3.  **Augment Payment Information**: For each payment, calculate two new attributes:
    *   `calc_payment_week_start`: The start date of the calendar week in which the payment occurred.
    *   `calc_is_weekend_payment`: A boolean flag indicating if the payment was made on a Saturday or Sunday.
4.  **Filter Payments by Time Period**: Select only those augmented payment records where `calc_payment_week_start` falls within the defined 8-week period.
5.  **Group Payments by Week**: Partition the filtered payments by `calc_payment_week_start`.
6.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each weekly group:
    *   Count the total number of payments (`COUNT(Sales.payment)` which refers to the underlying `PaymentsReceived` records in the group).
    *   Sum the payments that occurred on a weekend using the `calc_is_weekend_payment` flag.

2.  `sales_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_in_vin.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This line takes the filtered `cars_with_m5_in_vin`.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
2.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days. We can achieve this using `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`. This condition means the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date/time should be 29 days or less (0 days for today, 1 day for yesterday, up to 29 days for 29 days ago).
3.  Use the `Dealership` (the high-level graph collection) and its `CALCULATE` method to compute:
    *   The total count of these filtered sales (`number_of_sales`).
    *   The sum of `sale_price` for these filtered sales (`total_revenue_from_sales`).

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `toyota_sales_last_30_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: It filters sales records to include only those where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This condition filters sales based on their `sale_date`.
        *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
        *   `<= 29` ensures that only sales from today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago (29 days difference) are included, effectively covering the last 30 days inclusive of today.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only sales that are for Toyota cars AND occurred within the last 30 days are selected.

2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final aggregated results using the `Dealership` top-level collection.
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(toyota_sales_last_30_days)`: This counts the number of records in the `toyota_sales_last_30_days` filtered collection, giving the total number of Toyota cars sold in the specified period.
    *   `total_revenue_from_sales = SUM(toyota_sales_last_30_days.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` for all sales in the `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection, providing the total revenue from these sales.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_metrics = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to compute new fields and select existing ones for each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name` and `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them with a prefix `sp_` to avoid potential naming conflicts in subsequent steps.
    *   `sp_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (accessed via the `sales_made` sub-collection). If a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.
    *   `sp_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales for each salesperson. If a salesperson has no sales, this count will be 0.

2.  For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the associated car, and the `sale_price`.
3.  Crucially, for each car involved in a sale, we determine its latest inventory status. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the `inventory_snapshots` for that specific car.
    *   Using the `RANKING` function to find the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` (latest snapshot) for that car. The `per=""Cars""` argument ensures that ranking is performed distinctly for each car.
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to select this single latest snapshot.
    *   Retrieving the `is_in_inventory` status from this latest snapshot.
4.  We then filter these sales records, keeping only those where the car's `is_car_in_inventory_latest` status is `False`, indicating the car is no longer in inventory.
5.  The filtered sales are then grouped using `PARTITION` by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`.

The metrics are for the last 6 full months, excluding the current month. The results should be ordered by month, and months are to be represented in ""YYYY-MM"" format.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Range**:
    *   `window_start_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. For example, if the current month is August 2023, this will be February 1, 2023.
    *   `window_end_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the current month. Sales on or after this date are excluded. This ensures we only consider sales from the 6 full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**:
    *   `selected_salespersons`: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023.

3.  **Process Sales Data**:
    *   `sales_in_scope`:
        *   Accesses `sales_made` from the `selected_salespersons`.
        *   For each sale, it calculates `sale_month_start_datetime` by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month. This is used for grouping and filtering by month.
        *   The `sale_price` is carried forward as `price_of_sale`.
        *   Filters these sales to include only those where `sale_month_start_datetime` falls within the defined 6-month window (`>= window_start_date_val` and `< window_end_date_val`).

4.  **Aggregate Monthly Metrics**:
    *   `monthly_sales_summary`:
        *   Takes `sales_in_scope` and partitions it by `sale_month_start_datetime`. This groups all sales by the calendar month they occurred in.
        *   For each month group:
            *   `month_date_value`: Stores the actual datetime value for the start of the month (from the partition key).
            *   `pmsps_val`: Calculates PMSPS by counting the number of sales (`COUNT(sales_in_scope)`) within that month's group.
            *   `pmsr_val`: Calculates PMSR by summing the `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month's group. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a month had sales but they all summed to null (or if `SUM` on an empty set is null), it would show 0.0.
        *   Orders the results chronologically by `month_date_value`.

5.  **Format Output**:
    *   `final_monthly_metrics`:
        *   Takes the `monthly_sales_summary`.
        *   Formats the `month_date_value` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (e.g., ""2023-02"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for two-digit month padding.
        *   Selects the final fields: `month` (the formatted string), `PMSPS` (from `pmsps_val`), and `PMSR` (from `pmsr_val`).

**Note on ""all months""**: This solution will list months for which there was at least one sale from the selected salespersons within the specified period. If one of the 6 months in the window had zero sales from this group, that month would not appear in the output, as PyDough's `PARTITION` typically creates groups based on existing data. The requirement ""Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0"" is met for months that have data to form a partition; `DEFAULT_TO` handles the zero metrics in such cases. Generating rows for months with absolutely no underlying data would require a different approach, like using a calendar dimension, which is not explicitly available or standard in these PyDough examples.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because the final result is a single aggregated value (the overall average).
2.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of days between the `sale_date` (from the related `Sales` record accessed via `sale_record`) and the `payment_date` of the current payment.
    *   The result of this difference is stored in a new temporary field called `days_difference` for each payment.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `Dealership` top-level collection to calculate a single aggregated GPM value.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step:
    *   We determine the `total_revenue_for_2023_sales`. This is done by filtering the `Sales` collection for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023, and then summing their `sale_price`.
    *   We determine the `total_cost_for_2023_sales`. This involves filtering the `Sales` collection for 2023 sales, accessing the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale, and then summing these costs.
3.  In the second `CALCULATE` step, we use the `total_revenue_for_2023_sales` and `total_cost_for_2023_sales` computed in the previous step to apply the GPM formula.

The final result will be a single value representing the GPM for all sales in 2023.

```python
gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023_sales = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of cars sold in 2023
    total_cost_for_2023_sales = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_for_2023_sales - total_cost_for_2023_sales) / total_cost_for_2023_sales * 100
)
```
This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  It initializes a calculation at the `Dealership` level, which is suitable for global aggregations.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023_sales`: It filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales from the year 2023 (using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`) and then sums the `sale_price` of these sales.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023_sales`: Similarly, it filters sales from 2023 and then sums the `cost` of the `car` associated with each of these sales (accessed via `Sales.car.cost`).
3.  The second `CALCULATE` takes these two computed totals (`total_revenue_for_2023_sales` and `total_cost_for_2023_sales`) and applies the GPM formula: `(revenue - cost) / cost * 100`. The result is stored in the `gpm_2023` field.

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting from the `Sales` collection and applies a filter.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated `car` has at least one `inventory_snapshot` that meets the specified criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')))`: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the car.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: Ensures the snapshot indicates the car is out of inventory.
        *   `DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')`: Compares the `snapshot_date` with the `sale_date` of the sale, ensuring they fall on the same calendar day by truncating both to the start of the day.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_on_out_day = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: This line takes the filtered sales (those that occurred on the day the car went out of inventory) and selects the top 1 sale based on `sale_price` in descending order. This effectively finds the car sold at the highest price under the given conditions.

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_on_out_day.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`: This final step takes the single sale record identified and extracts the `make` and `model` from the associated `car` object, along with the `sale_price` from the sale record itself.

2.  Group these records by year and month using `PARTITION`. For each group (each month), calculate the sum of `payment_amount` to get the total payments for that month.
3.  Order these monthly totals chronologically by year and then by month. This ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the previous month's data.
4.  Use the `PREV` window function to retrieve the `total_monthly_payments` from the previous month. We set a `default=0.0` for cases where there is no preceding month in the data (e.g., the very first month in the dataset), ensuring the MoM calculation is `current_month_total - 0.0`.
5.  Calculate the MoM change as `(current_month_total_payments - previous_month_total_payments)`.
6.  Select the final fields: year, month, total payments received for the month, and the calculated MoM change.
7.  The query will list all months that have payment data. If a calendar month has no payments, it will not appear in the results.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days (i.e., from 6 days ago up to today). We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `sale_date` with the current date (`'now'`). The condition `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6` will select sales from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago (6 days difference), covering a 7-day period.
3.  Count the number of sales records that meet this criteria.
4.  Assign this count to a field named `TSC` in the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `Dealership` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  `TSC=COUNT(...)`: We define a new field `TSC` (Total Sales Count).
3.  `Dealership.Sales`: We access the `Sales` sub-collection from the `Dealership`.
4.  `.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6)`: This filters the sales records.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date/time (`'now'`).
    *   `<= 6`: This condition ensures that we only include sales that occurred today (0 days difference), yesterday (1 day difference), ..., up to 6 days ago (6 days difference). This covers a total span of 7 days, inclusive of today.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_customer_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   `customer_state_from_sale=customer.state`: For each sale, it retrieves the state of the associated customer. `customer` is a link to the `Customers` collection.
    *   `current_sale_price=sale_price`: It takes the `sale_price` for the current sale.
    *   `customer_identifier=customer_id`: It takes the `customer_id` associated with the sale. This will be used for counting unique customers.

2.  `state_revenue_summary = sales_with_customer_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sales_by_state"", by=(customer_state_from_sale))`: This groups the records from `sales_with_customer_info` based on the `customer_state_from_sale`. Each group (partition) represents a unique state.
    *   `.CALCULATE(state=customer_state_from_sale, ...)`: For each state partition:
        *   `state=customer_state_from_sale`:  The name of the state.
        *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer_identifier)`: Calculates the number of distinct customers within that state by counting the unique `customer_identifier` values from the sales records belonging to that state's partition. `Sales` here refers to the sub-collection of sales records within the current partition.
        *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.current_sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for that state by summing the `current_sale_price` of all sales records within that state's partition.

3.  `top_states_by_revenue = state_revenue_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the `state_revenue_summary` (which contains state, unique customer count, and total revenue for all states).

    *   `total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts the number of payment records within each `payment_method` group. `PaymentsReceived` here refers to the sub-collection of payments belonging to the current group.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments within the current `payment_method` group.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_amount.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of payment methods with their total payments and total amounts) and selects the top 3 entries.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",47.38813495635986,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

**Explanation:**

1.  `salespersons_employment_info = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to create a new set of fields for each salesperson:
        *   `s_first_name`: Stores the salesperson's `first_name`.
        *   `s_last_name`: Stores the salesperson's `last_name`.
        *   `s_phone`: Stores the salesperson's `phone` number.
        *   `employment_duration_days`: Calculates the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`. If `termination_date` is null (meaning the salesperson is still employed), this duration is expected to be null.

2.  `shortest_employed_salesperson = salespersons_employment_info.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `salespersons_employment_info` collection.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`: This function selects the top 1 salesperson. The selection is ordered by `employment_duration_days` in ascending order (`ASC()`). Crucially, if `employment_duration_days` is null (e.g., for salespersons not yet terminated), `ASC()` places these nulls at the end of the sort order by default. This ensures that the ""top 1"" will be the salesperson with the smallest actual (non-null) employment duration.
    *   `.CALCULATE(first_name=s_first_name, last_name=s_last_name, phone=s_phone, days_employed=employment_duration_days)`: After selecting the salesperson with the shortest employment, this `CALCULATE` clause formats the output to include:
        *   `first_name`: The first name of the salesperson.
        *   `last_name`: The last name of the salesperson.
        *   `phone`: The phone number of the salesperson.
        *   `days_employed`: The calculated employment duration in days.

The final result is stored in the `shortest_employed_salesperson` variable.",55.36440658569336,"# Calculate employment duration and select relevant fields for all salespersons

1.  **Define the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week runs from Monday to Sunday.
    *   We first determine the start of the current week. Assuming `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week (which is consistent with ISO week conventions).
    *   The previous ISO week's Monday (`prev_week_start_dt`) is then 7 days before the start of the current week.
    *   The previous ISO week's Sunday (`prev_week_end_dt`) is 1 day before the start of the current week.
    *   These dates are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level) collection.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `prev_week_start_dt` and `prev_week_end_dt` (inclusive).

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For each filtered payment, we extract the day part of the `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` to ensure aggregation is done on a daily basis. This will be `pay_day_key`.
    *   The `payment_method` will be `pay_method_key`.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   The prepared payment data is then partitioned by `pay_day_key` and `pay_method_key`. This creates groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   For each group, we calculate the sum of `payment_amount` using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.

5.  **Output**:
    *   The result will show the payment day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_transformed`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` clause, we derive:
        *   `customer_st`: The state of the customer associated with the sale, accessed via `customer.state`.
        *   `_month_of_sale`: An intermediate field for the month of the sale.
        *   `_first_month_in_quarter_num`: An intermediate field that determines the first month number (1, 4, 7, or 10) of the quarter based on `_month_of_sale`.
        *   `quarter_start_dt_str`: The final string representation of the quarter's start date (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This is constructed using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for correct formatting.

2.  `quarterly_sales_report`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_transformed` data. The partitioning keys are `customer_st` and `quarter_start_dt_str`. This groups sales by unique combinations of customer state and quarter start date.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause on the partitioned data then:
        *   Selects the partitioning keys `customer_st` (as `state_val`) and `quarter_start_dt_str` (as `quarter_val`).
        *   Calculates `total_sales_for_quarter` by summing `Sales.sale_price` for all sales records belonging to each group.

3.  `result`:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` statement is used to select and rename the fields to `customer_state`, `quarter`, and `total_sales` as requested by the problem description.

-   `is_in_inventory == True`: This filters for snapshots where the car is actually in inventory.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection. For each drug, we will calculate its name and its average Defined Daily Dose (DDD).

2.  **`drug_name = drug_name`**: This selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection to be included in the output.

3.  **`average_ddd_value = AVG(...)`**: This calculates the average DDD for each drug. The `AVG` function aggregates DDD values calculated from the drug's associated treatments.

4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: This accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.

5.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total days of treatment is a positive value. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the duration of the treatment in full days. This condition prevents division by zero (if duration is 0) or illogical negative DDDs (if duration is negative).

6.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_ddd = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD:
    *   `tot_drug_amt`: Represents the ""total drug amount consumed during one treatment"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: Represents the ""total days of treatment"".
    *   The result is named `treatment_ddd`.

7.  **`.treatment_ddd`**: After calculating `treatment_ddd` for all valid treatments of a drug, this expression provides these individual DDD values to the `AVG` function.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name` and its corresponding `average_ddd_value`. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria (e.g., all treatments have null end dates or non-positive durations), its `average_ddd_value` will likely be null.",43.00602459907532,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

    *   `calc_treatment_month_start_date`: The first day of the month in which the treatment started. This will be used for date-based filtering.
    *   `calc_month_label`: A string representation of the treatment's month and year (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). This will be used for grouping and as the output month identifier.

2.  **Filter for Relevant Period**: We'll define the time window as the last three full months, excluding the current month. Treatments falling within this window will be selected using `calc_treatment_month_start_date`.
    *   The start of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')`.
    *   The end of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (exclusive).

3.  **Group by Month**: The filtered treatments will be partitioned by `calc_month_label`.

4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month group:
    *   `total_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among all treatments in that month.
    *   `biologic_drug_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among treatments in that month where the `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.

4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition for each patient.
    *   **`treatments_received.WHERE(...)`**: For each patient, we look at their `treatments_received`. We then filter these treatments.
    *   **`(treatments_received.diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`**: This condition checks if the diagnosis associated with the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'. We navigate from the treatment to its linked `diagnosis` record and then to its `diag_name` field.
    *   **`& (treatments_received.drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')`**: This condition checks if the drug used in the treatment is of type 'Biologic'. We navigate from the treatment to its linked `drug` record and then to its `drug_type` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:

For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` would be July 1st, 2024. Subtracting 6 months gives January 1st, 2024. Treatments on or after this date are included.
    *   `end_period_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This calculates the first day of the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, this would be July 1st, 2024. Treatments before this date are included (i.e., up to June 30th, 2024).

2.  **Filter Patients**:
    *   `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This selects all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".

3.  **Access and Filter Treatments**:
    *   `.treatments_received`: For the selected patient(s), this accesses their list of treatments.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_period_inclusive) & (start_dt < end_period_exclusive))`: This filters the treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` (start date of the treatment) falls within the defined six-month period, excluding the current month.

4.  **Count Treatments**:
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the number of treatments that satisfy all the above conditions.
    *   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(num_alice_treatments_last_6m_exclusive = ...)`: The final count is assigned to the field `num_alice_treatments_last_6m_exclusive` within the main `DermTreatment` context, resulting in a single aggregated value.

1.  **Calculate Distinct Drug Counts**: For each doctor, we first calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by accessing their `prescribed_treatments`, then the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique `drug_id` values. We'll store this along with the doctor's ID and specialty.
2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We then partition these doctors based on their `speciality`. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  **Rank within Specialty**: Within each specialty group (partition), we rank the doctors. The ranking (`SDRSDR`) is based on the `num_distinct_drugs` (calculated in step 1) in descending order, so doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a better (lower number) rank. The `per` clause of the `RANKING` function will refer to the named partition to ensure ranking is done independently for each specialty.
4.  **Select Final Fields**: Finally, we select the required fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, `num_distinct_drugs`, and the calculated `SDRSDR`.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor,
# along with their ID and specialty.
doc_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(
    doc_id=doc_id,
    speciality_field=speciality,  # Use an intermediate name for the specialty field
    num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)
)

# Step 2: Partition the doctors by their specialty.
# The 'Doctors' collection items (now represented by 'doc_info') are grouped by 'speciality_field'.
# The name ""specialty_partition"" will be used to refer to these groups in the ranking step.
# Then, we access the 'Doctors' items within each partition to perform calculations on individual doctors.

    SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_partition"")  # Rank within the specialty_partition
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `doc_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   It calculates three fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `speciality_field`: The doctor's specialty. We use an intermediate name `speciality_field` to make it distinct for partitioning.
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`. It counts the number of unique drug IDs found across all treatments prescribed by the doctor.

2.  `result = doc_info.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `doc_info` collection (which contains doctors with their distinct drug counts).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_partition"", by=(speciality_field))`: It partitions the doctors into groups based on their `speciality_field`. Each group is named `specialty_partition`.

3.  `.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   After partitioning, `.Doctors` accesses the individual doctor records within each `specialty_partition`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then computes the final set of fields for each doctor within their specialty group:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `speciality`: The doctor's specialty (taken from the `speciality_field` partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: The previously calculated count of distinct drugs.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_partition"")`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (more drugs = better rank, i.e., rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_partition""`: This crucial part ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group (partition). Doctors are only ranked against other doctors in the same specialty.

The final `result` variable will contain a collection where each record represents a doctor with their ID, specialty, the number of distinct drugs they prescribed, and their rank within that specialty based on this count.",72.66728615760803,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor,

2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `first_name` starts with 'j'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
3.  **`CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `last_name` contains the substring 'son'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
4.  **`|`**: This is the logical OR operator, combining the two conditions. A doctor will be included if their first name starts with 'j' OR their last name contains 'son'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this selects and renames the required fields:

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   The query first establishes the time window: the last 12 full months, excluding the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_date` is calculated as the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `period_start_date` is calculated by subtracting 12 months from `current_month_start_date`, effectively giving the start of the 12-month observation window.
    *   These dates are calculated once at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level for efficiency.

2.  **Filtering Treatments**:
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Treatments are filtered using `WHERE` to include only those whose `start_dt` falls on or after `period_start_date` and before `current_month_start_date`. This ensures we get exactly 12 months of data, excluding the current month.

3.  **Preparing for Aggregation**:
    *   For the filtered treatments, `CALCULATE` is used to extract `treatment_start_year = YEAR(start_dt)` and `treatment_start_month = MONTH(start_dt)`. These will serve as keys for monthly aggregation. The instruction ""Truncate start_dt to month for aggregation"" is achieved by grouping by these year and month components.

4.  **Monthly Aggregation (Partitioning)**:
    *   The `PARTITION` function groups the `treatments_in_period` by `treatment_start_year` and `treatment_start_month`.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `month_display_label`: A string representation of the month (e.g., ""2023-01"") for easy readability, using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `PMPD` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received treatments (and thus had associated diagnoses) within that specific month.
        *   `PMTC` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated as `COUNT(Treatments.treatment_id)`. This counts the total number of treatments administered in that month.

5.  **Ordering**:
    *   The results are ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC())`.

6.  **Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to match the requested output: `month` (the YYYY-MM label), `PMPD`, and `PMTC`.

This query will return a row for each of the last 12 months (if there was activity), showing the month, the count of unique patients diagnosed (PMPD), and the total count of treatments (PMTC).",59.21715140342712,"# Define date boundaries for the last 12 months, excluding the current month

2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the new patients by their first treatment year and count them. This gives us the `number_of_new_patients` for each year.
3.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI is the increase in the number of new patients compared to the previous year's count.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`:
    *   Starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`: Filters out patients who have no treatment records.
    *   `CALCULATE(first_treatment_year_val = YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))`: For each remaining patient, it finds the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` from all their `treatments_received`. `YEAR()` extracts the year from this date. This year is stored as `first_treatment_year_val`. Each row in this result represents a patient and the year they became a ""new patient"".

2.  `new_patients_by_year_counts`:
    *   Takes `patient_first_treatment_info`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year_val)`: Groups the patients based on their `first_treatment_year_val`.
    *   `CALCULATE(year_val = first_treatment_year_val, num_new_patients_val = COUNT(Patients))`: For each group (i.e., for each year), it outputs the `year_val` and counts the number of patients (`COUNT(Patients)`) in that group. This count is the `num_new_patients_val` for that year.

3.  `sorted_new_patients_by_year`:
    *   Takes `new_patients_by_year_counts`.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year_val.ASC())`: Sorts the yearly counts in ascending order by year. This is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly.

4.  `yearly_npi_data`:
    *   Takes `sorted_new_patients_by_year`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `year = year_val`: Selects the year.

What is the overall D7D100PIR across all treatments? Return the percentage value.D7D100PIR (day 7 to day 100 PASI improvement rate) = (avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.

1.  Identify the relevant `Outcomes` records: We are interested in records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the condition `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` to check for non-null numeric values, as comparisons with `NULL` typically yield `NULL`, and `NULL` in a `WHERE` condition filters out the row.
2.  Calculate Averages: From these filtered outcomes, we need to compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` globally.
3.  Apply the Formula: Use the given formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
4.  Handle Division by Zero: If the average `day7_pasi_score` is zero, the formula would lead to division by zero. In this case, the result should be `null`.

This will be done using a two-stage `CALCULATE`:
-   The first `CALCULATE` computes `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100` from the filtered `Outcomes`.
-   The second `CALCULATE` uses these averages to compute the final `d7d100pir_percentage`.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block is performed on the top-level `DermTreatment` collection.
    *   It computes two aggregate values:
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d7`: This is the average of `day7_pasi_score` from `Outcomes` records. The `Outcomes` are filtered to include only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` works because if `field` is `NULL`, comparisons like `NULL > 0` result in `NULL`, and `NULL | NULL` is `NULL`, causing the `WHERE` clause to filter out such rows.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: Similarly, this is the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the same set of filtered `Outcomes`.
    *   The result of this stage (`calculation_stage`) is a collection with a single row containing `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100`.

2.  The second `CALCULATE` block operates on `calculation_stage`.
    *   It calculates `d7d100pir_percentage` using the averages computed in the previous stage.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `avg_pasi_score_d7` might be zero. If it is zero, `KEEP_IF(0.0, 1==0)` (which evaluates to `null`) is returned to prevent division by zero errors. Otherwise, the D7D100PIR formula `(avg_pasi_score_d100 - avg_pasi_score_d7) / avg_pasi_score_d7 * 100.0` is applied. The `100.0` ensures floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.

The final `result` will be a collection with one row and one column, `d7d100pir_percentage`, containing the overall D7D100PIR value. A negative percentage indicates an improvement (reduction) in PASI score from day 7 to day 100.",89.02192735671997,"# Stage 1: Calculate average PASI scores for day 7 and day 100 from valid outcomes

        *   `ins_type == 'private'`: Selects only patients whose insurance type is 'private'.

1.  Iterate through each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, calculate a new field `num_adverse_events_same_month`. This calculation involves:
    a.  Accessing all treatments associated with the current drug via the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
    b.  For each of these treatments, accessing its associated adverse events via the `adverse_events` sub-collection.
    c.  Filtering these adverse events. An adverse event is kept if the year of its `reported_dt` matches the year of its parent treatment's `start_dt`, AND the month of its `reported_dt` matches the month of its parent treatment's `start_dt`. The path `treatment.start_dt` is used within the context of an adverse event to refer to the start date of the treatment to which the adverse event is linked.
    d.  Counting all such filtered adverse events. This sum represents the total number of adverse events for the current drug that occurred in the same month and year as their respective treatment start dates.
3.  Once this count is determined for every drug, use the `TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events_same_month.DESC())` function to identify the drug with the maximum count. If there's a tie, one of the top drugs will be selected.
4.  Finally, select the `drug_id` (as ""drug's _id""), `drug_name`, and the calculated `num_adverse_events_same_month` (renamed to `num_adverse_events`) for the identified drug.

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'biologic')` checks each doctor's prescribed treatments and, for each treatment, looks at the associated `drug` to see if its `drug_type` is 'biologic'. This results in a sub-collection of treatments (for that doctor) that used biologic drugs.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors`**: We start by accessing the `Doctors` collection, which contains information about all doctors.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `prescribed_treatments` is a sub-collection (a list) of treatments associated with each doctor.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` checks if this list is not empty (i.e., the doctor has prescribed at least one treatment).
    *   `== 1` completes the condition, ensuring we only keep doctors for whom `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_id=doc_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**: This step selects the specified fields for the doctors who met the filter criteria.
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `first_name=first_name`: Selects the doctor's first name.
    *   `last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.

The query will return a list of doctors, each with their `doc_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`, who have prescribed at least one treatment.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   `start_date_limit = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-5 months')`: This calculates the first day of the calendar month that was 5 months before the current month. For instance, if the current month is July, this will be February 1st.
    *   `end_date_limit = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '+1 month')`: This calculates the first day of the calendar month immediately following the current month. For instance, if the current month is July, this will be August 1st.
    *   The treatments will be filtered for `start_dt` between `start_date_limit` (inclusive) and `end_date_limit` (exclusive), effectively covering the last 6 full calendar months including the current one.

2.  **Initial Data Preparation (`filtered_treatments_with_specialty`)**:
    *   The query starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE(doc_specialty_field = doctor.speciality)`: It first accesses the related `doctor` for each treatment and retrieves their `speciality`, storing it in a new field `doc_specialty_field`. This is necessary because `PARTITION` requires its `by` keys to be direct fields of the collection being partitioned.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_date_limit) & (start_dt < end_date_limit))`: It then filters these treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated 6-month window.

3.  **Partitioning by Specialty (`partitioned_by_specialty`)**:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty_field))`: The filtered treatments are grouped (partitioned) by the `doc_specialty_field`. Each group, named `specialty_group`, contains all treatments prescribed by doctors of a particular specialty within the specified timeframe.

4.  **Aggregation per Specialty (`specialty_aggregates`)**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each specialty group created by the partition:
        *   `specialty = doc_specialty_field`: The specialty name is taken directly from the partition key.
        *   `num_treatments = COUNT(Treatments)`: The total number of treatments within that specialty group is counted. `Treatments` here refers to the records from the original `Treatments` collection that fall into the current partition group.
        *   `total_drug_amount = SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: The total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) for all treatments within that specialty group is summed up.

5.  **Selecting Top 3 (`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`)**:
    *   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())`: From the aggregated results per specialty, this selects the top 3 specialties based on the `total_drug_amount`, ordered in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**:
    *   This starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   It then partitions (groups) the patients based on their `ins_type` (insurance type). Each group will represent a unique insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(ins_type=ins_type, avg_height_cm_val=AVG(Patients.height_cm), avg_weight_kg_val=AVG(Patients.weight_kg))`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` partition (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
        *   `ins_type=ins_type`: Selects the insurance type.
        *   `avg_height_cm_val=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: Calculates the average `height_cm` for all patients within that insurance type group. The result is stored in a new field `avg_height_cm_val`.
        *   `avg_weight_kg_val=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Calculates the average `weight_kg` for all patients within that insurance type group. The result is stored in a new field `avg_weight_kg_val`.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm_val.DESC())`**:
    *   This takes the results from the previous step (one record per insurance type with its average height and weight).
    *   It selects the top 3 records based on the `avg_height_cm_val` in descending order (highest average height first).

4.  **`.CALCULATE(insurance_type=ins_type, average_height=avg_height_cm_val, average_weight=avg_weight_kg_val)`**:
    *   For the top 3 records selected:
        *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: Renames/selects the `ins_type` field as `insurance_type`.
        *   `average_height=avg_height_cm_val`: Renames/selects the `avg_height_cm_val` field as `average_height`.
        *   `average_weight=avg_weight_kg_val`: Renames/selects the `avg_weight_kg_val` field as `average_weight`.
    *   This step ensures the final output has the requested field names.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in) == 1)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   Filters out drugs that have not been used in any treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in) == 1)`. This ensures that subsequent calculations like `COUNT` and `AVG` are performed on drugs with actual treatment data.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each drug that has associated treatments, this step calculates:
        *   `drug_name_val=drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
        *   `num_treatments_val=COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with the drug. `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection of treatments for each drug.
        *   `avg_drug_amount_val=AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`: Calculates the average of `tot_drug_amt` (total drug amount) across all treatments associated with the drug.

3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=(num_treatments_val.DESC(), avg_drug_amount_val.DESC()))`**:
    *   Selects the top 5 drugs from the results of the previous `CALCULATE` step.
    *   The ranking is determined by two criteria:
        *   Primarily by `num_treatments_val` in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning drugs with more treatments are ranked higher.
        *   Secondarily by `avg_drug_amount_val` in descending order (`DESC()`), used as a tie-breaker if drugs have the same number of treatments.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(drug_name=drug_name_val, ...)`**:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` step selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `drug_name`, `number_of_treatments`, and `average_drug_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries**:
    *   `treatment_period_start_dt = DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: This calculates the date 6 months prior to the current date.
    *   `treatment_period_end_dt = DATETIME('now')`: This represents the current date.
    These variables are used to define the window for the treatment's end date.

2.  **Filter Treatments (`Treatments.WHERE(...)`)**:
    The query starts by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applies a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions must be met for a treatment to be included:
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition filters treatments linked to a diagnosis whose name contains ""psoriasis"".
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment.
        *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Performs a wildcard search (like SQL `LIKE '%psoriasis%'`) to find ""psoriasis"" anywhere within the diagnosis name.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date, meaning it is FDA-approved.
        *   `drug.fda_appr_dt`: Accesses the FDA approval date of the drug associated with the treatment.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if this date field is present (not null).
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has a recorded end date.
    *   `(end_dt >= treatment_period_start_dt) & (end_dt <= treatment_period_end_dt)`: This condition filters treatments that ended within the last 6 months.
        *   `end_dt`: Refers to the end date of the treatment.
        *   The treatment's `end_dt` must be on or after 6 months ago (`>= treatment_period_start_dt`) and on or before today (`<= treatment_period_end_dt`).

3.  **Count Qualifying Treatments (`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`)**:
    *   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: The final aggregation is performed on the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to produce a single result.
    *   `num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments_query)`: This counts the number of treatments that satisfied all the conditions in the `filtered_treatments_query` and assigns this count to the field `num_qualifying_treatments`.

The variable `result` will hold a single record with one field, `num_qualifying_treatments`, indicating the total number of treatments meeting all specified criteria.",37.856767416000366,"# Define the time boundaries for the treatment end date

    *   Ranking these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The ranking is performed per doctor.
    *   Selecting the treatment with rank 1. We use `allow_ties=False` to ensure a single ""first"" treatment is chosen if multiple treatments share the earliest start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  `first_treatment_details_expr`: This contextless expression defines how to find the first treatment for any given doctor.
    *   `Doctors.prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1)`: Filters these treatments to find the one(s) that rank first when ordered by `start_dt` (ascending). `per=""Doctors""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each doctor's treatments. `allow_ties=False` ensures that if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, only one is ranked as 1 (the choice among ties is database-dependent but consistent).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record due to `RANKING ... == 1` and `allow_ties=False`) into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields. If no treatments exist, or if the filter yields no results, this will be a null record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`selected_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection.
    *   It filters these treatments based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `is_placebo == True`: The treatment must be a placebo.
        *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)) == 1`: The treatment must have at least one associated concomitant medication that started within a specific timeframe relative to the treatment's start.
            *   The inner `WHERE` clause on `concomitant_meds` filters medications whose start date (`concomitant_meds.start_dt`) is between 0 and 14 days (inclusive) after the treatment's start date (`start_dt` from the `Treatments` context). `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start, med_start)` calculates this difference.

2.  **`result = selected_treatments.concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `selected_treatments` (those that met the criteria from step 1).
    *   `selected_treatments.concomitant_meds` accesses all concomitant medications associated with these filtered treatments. The query now operates on each of these concomitant medications.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output rows. For each concomitant medication:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`: Retrieves the `treatment_id` from the parent `Treatment` record (linked via `treatment`).
        *   `treatment_start_date = treatment.start_dt`: Retrieves the `start_dt` of the parent `Treatment`.
        *   `treatment_end_date = treatment.end_dt`: Retrieves the `end_dt` of the parent `Treatment`.
        *   `concomitant_med_name = med_name`: Retrieves the `med_name` of the current concomitant medication.
        *   `concomitant_med_start_date = start_dt`: Retrieves the `start_dt` of the current concomitant medication.
        *   `concomitant_med_end_date = end_dt`: Retrieves the `end_dt` of the current concomitant medication.

The final `result` will contain one row for every concomitant medication that belongs to a placebo treatment meeting the specified date criteria for at least one of its medications.

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level collection `DermTreatment` because we want a single aggregated result.
2.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Male"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients who are male and have private insurance.
    *   `gender == ""Male""`: Filters for male patients.
    *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Filters for patients with private insurance.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant:
    a.  Identify all `transactions_received` that have a `status` of `""successful""`.
    b.  From these successful transactions, count the number of distinct `coupon_id`s that are present. This gives the ""number of distinct coupons used"".
    c.  Count the total number of these successful transactions. This gives the ""number of distinct transactions"".

    e.  If the number of successful transactions is zero, the CPUR should be `null` to avoid division by zero.
3.  Return the merchant's name and the calculated CPUR.

We will use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
-   The first `CALCULATE` will compute the intermediate values: the count of distinct coupons used in successful transactions and the count of distinct successful transactions for each merchant.
-   The second `CALCULATE` will use these intermediate values to compute the final CPUR and select the merchant's name and the CPUR.

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection.
2.  `merchant_name_field=name`: We select the merchant's `name` and assign it to `merchant_name_field`.
3.  `distinct_coupons_in_successful_tx_count=NDISTINCT(...)`:

    *   `.coupon_id`: We then take the `coupon_id` from these filtered transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: This function counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s, giving us the ""number of distinct coupons used"" for successful transactions by that merchant.
4.  `successful_tx_count=COUNT(...)`:
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were `""successful""`.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of such successful transactions, giving us the ""number of distinct transactions"" (since each transaction record is distinct).
5.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` (stored in `merchant_intermediate_stats`) is then passed to a second `CALCULATE`.
6.  `merchant_name=merchant_name_field`: We select the merchant's name for the final output.
7.  `cpur=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
    *   `IFF(successful_tx_count > 0, ... , null)`: This is a conditional expression.
    *   If `successful_tx_count` is greater than 0, it calculates `distinct_coupons_in_successful_tx_count / successful_tx_count`.
    *   Otherwise (if `successful_tx_count` is 0), it returns `null` for the CPUR to handle division by zero.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Establish Context**: We'll start from the `Ewallet` collection to calculate `current_week_start_val`, which is the start date of the current week. This will be used as a reference for identifying the target weeks.
2.  **Filter Users**: Navigate to `Users` and filter for users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""CA"".
3.  **Process Notifications**: For the `notifications` of these filtered users:
    *   Calculate `notification_actual_week_start`: Truncate the `created_at` timestamp of each notification to the start of its week. This will be used for grouping.
    *   Calculate `is_notification_weekend`: A boolean flag set to true if the notification's `created_at` day is a Saturday or Sunday.
    *   Calculate `num_weeks_before_current`: Determine how many full weeks the `notification_actual_week_start` is before the `current_week_start_val`.
4.  **Filter by Week**: Keep only those notifications where `num_weeks_before_current` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
5.  **Partition by Week**: Group these filtered notifications using `PARTITION` by the `notification_actual_week_start`.
6.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each weekly group:
    *   Output `week_start_date_output` (the week's start date).
    *   Calculate `total_notifications_count` by counting all notifications in the group.
    *   Calculate `weekend_notifications_count` by summing the `is_notification_weekend` flag (True becomes 1, False becomes 0 in SUM).
7.  **Order Results**: Sort the weekly summaries by `week_start_date_output` in descending order to show the most recent of the three weeks first.

This PyDough code performs the following actions:

2.  It filters users to include only those from the ""US"" or ""CA"".
3.  For each notification associated with these users, it calculates:

    *   `num_weeks_before_current`: The difference in weeks between the notification's week start and the `current_week_start_val`.
4.  It filters these processed notifications to retain only those where `num_weeks_before_current` is 1, 2, or 3, effectively selecting notifications from the three full weeks prior to the current week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_user_balances_updates`: This variable stores records from the `UserBalances` collection that have been updated from 7 days ago up to the current time. The condition `updated_at >= DATETIME('now', '-7 days')` achieves this filtering.
2.  `per_user_average_balance`:
    *   We take `recent_user_balances_updates` and `PARTITION` it by `user_id`. This creates groups of balance records, one group for each unique user who had updates in the last 7 days.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these user-specific groups. `user_avg_bal = AVG(UserBalances.balance)` calculates the average balance for the current user's records within that 7-day period. This value represents the AMB for that specific user.
3.  `result`:
    *   Finally, we use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to compute a global aggregate.
    *   `average_balance = AVG(per_user_average_balance.user_avg_bal)` calculates the average of all the `user_avg_bal` values obtained in the previous step.

1.  `latest_balance_for_user = Users.balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True) == 1).SINGULAR()`:

    *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True)`: This function ranks the balance records for each user.
        *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (most recent first).
        *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures the ranking is performed independently for each user (i.e., partitioned by user).
        *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple balance records share the same latest `updated_at` timestamp, they will all receive rank 1.
    *   `.WHERE(... == 1)`: Filters these ranked balances to keep only those with rank 1 (the latest ones).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which might be a collection of one or more tied latest balances) into a single conceptual record. If there are ties for rank 1, one record will be chosen. This allows direct field access (e.g., `.balance`). If a user has no balances, this expression will effectively be null for that user.

This involves summing the amounts from successfully received transactions where the receiver type indicates a merchant, and then ranking merchants based on these total amounts.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Start with the `Merchants` collection**: This is because we need to output information and rankings for each merchant.
2.  **Calculate Revenue for Each Merchant**:
    *   For each merchant, we access their `transactions_received`. These are transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only ""successful"" ones. The problem implies ""successfully received transactions"", so we'll filter by `status == ""completed""` (a common status for successful transactions).
    *   Additionally, we filter by `receiver_type == 1` as specified in the problem description for transactions pertaining to merchants.
    *   The `amount` of these filtered transactions is summed up to get `calculated_revenue` for each merchant. If a merchant has no such transactions, this sum might be NULL or 0. We assume `SUM` over an empty set results in NULL.
    *   We also select the merchant's `name` and `category` for the final output, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` temporarily to avoid potential naming conflicts.
3.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Fields**:
    *   The previously calculated `m_name`, `m_category`, and `calculated_revenue` are carried forward.
    *   The `RANKING` function is used to determine `revenue_rank`.
        *   It ranks merchants based on `calculated_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the highest revenue gets rank 1.
        *   `na_pos='last'` is used within `DESC()` to ensure that merchants with NULL revenue (i.e., no qualifying transactions) are ranked last, contributing to deterministic output.
        *   `allow_ties=True` ensures that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects the required fields with the specified names: `merchant_name`, `category`, `revenue_amount`, and `revenue_rank`.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average number of daily active users within a given month.
An ""active user"" for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from the `Transactions` table where `sender_type` is 0 (indicating a user sender) and who made at least one transaction on that day.

The process involves these main steps:
1.  **Define Date Range**: Establish the time window for the analysis, which spans the two full calendar months immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is in July, the analysis period would be May 1st to June 30th.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this defined date range and have `sender_type = 0`. For these transactions, extract the year-month and day components from the `created_at` timestamp, and retain the `sender_id`.
3.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Group the filtered transactions by year-month and day. For each day, count the number of unique `sender_id`s. This gives the DAU for each day in the period.
4.  **Calculate PMDAU**: Group the daily DAU counts by year-month. For each month, calculate the average of its daily DAU values. This average is the PMDAU for that month.
5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in ascending order.

Explanation:
1.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration`:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters sessions to include only those starting from `2023-06-01T00:00:00` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `2023-06-08T00:00:00` (exclusive).
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then computes two new attributes for each of these sessions:
        *   `user_id_attr`: This is the `user_id` from the session, which will be used for grouping.
        *   `session_duration_sec_attr`: This is the duration of the individual session in seconds, calculated using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`.

2.  `user_total_durations`:
    *   This step takes the `sessions_in_range_with_duration` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""user_sessions_group"", by=(user_id_attr))` groups the sessions by `user_id_attr`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` clause operates on each group:
        *   `user_id_col = user_id_attr`: Selects the user ID for the output.
        *   `total_duration_col = SUM(sessions_in_range_with_duration.session_duration_sec_attr)`: Calculates the sum of `session_duration_sec_attr` for all sessions within that user's group. This results in the total session duration for that user.

3.  `result`:
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(total_duration_col.DESC())` sorts the `user_total_durations` collection by the `total_duration_col` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date`: This variable defines the beginning of the previous month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncating it to the start of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracting one month (`'-1 month'`).
2.  `current_month_start_date`: This variable defines the end of the previous month (exclusive), which is equivalent to the beginning of the current month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp and truncating it to the start of the current month.
3.  `transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the `prev_month_start_date` (inclusive) and `current_month_start_date` (exclusive).
4.  `str_calculation_output = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This block performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` graph level, resulting in a single row.
    *   `num_successful_transactions`: Counts transactions from `transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is ""completed"". This is our definition of a successful transaction.
    *   `num_total_transactions`: Counts all transactions within `transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_str = ...)`: This chained `CALCULATE` uses the counts from the previous step to compute the STR.
    *   `IFF(num_total_transactions > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This conditional function checks if there were any transactions in the previous month.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `num_successful_transactions * 1.0 / num_total_transactions`. The `* 1.0` ensures floating-point division.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` operation on the `Merchants` collection computes `m_id` (merchant ID), `m_name` (merchant name), `m_creation_year` (year the merchant was created), and `m_creation_month` (month the merchant was created).
2.  The second `CALCULATE` operation uses the fields derived in the first step. For each merchant, it counts the number of associated `coupons` whose `created_at` year and month match the `m_creation_year` and `m_creation_month` of the merchant. This count is stored as `coupon_count_in_creation_month`.
3.  `TOP_K(1, by=coupon_count_in_creation_month.DESC())` then selects the single merchant who has the highest `coupon_count_in_creation_month`.
4.  The final `CALCULATE` formats the output to return the merchant's `mid`, `name`, and the `number_of_coupons` as requested.",30.545494318008423,"# Calculate merchant's creation year and month, and then count coupons created in that same month and year

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: The query starts by accessing the `Users` collection and applies a filter.
    *   **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters users whose `country` is 'US'. The `LOWER()` function ensures the comparison is case-insensitive as requested.

        *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This inner filter on the `notifications` sub-collection selects notifications that are of `notification_type == 'promotional'` AND have a `status == 'unread'`.
        *   **`HAS(...) == 1`**: This checks if the user has one or more such notifications.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, this step calculates the required output fields for each qualifying user.

        *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This is the same filter applied earlier within the `HAS` condition, ensuring we count exactly the type of notifications we're interested in (promotional and unread).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Selects transactions from the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Ensures that the sender was a user, not a merchant.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successful transactions.
    *   `sending_user.status == ""active""`: Filters for transactions where the `sending_user` (a reference to the `Users` collection) has an 'active' status.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for partitioning.
    *   `transaction_month_year_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(created_at), LPAD(MONTH(created_at), 2, ""0""))`: Creates a string representation of the month and year (e.g., ""2023-01""). `LPAD` ensures single-digit months are prefixed with a '0' for consistent formatting and sorting.
    *   `user_sender_id = sending_user.uid`: Extracts the unique ID (`uid`) of the sending user. This will be used for counting distinct users.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_transactions_group"", by=(transaction_month_year_str))`: Groups the transactions based on the `transaction_month_year_str`. Each group will contain all transactions for a specific month of 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (after `PARTITION`): This calculates the required output fields for each month-group.
    *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_year_str`: Selects the month string (which serves as the ""month as a date"" representation).
    *   `num_distinct_active_users = NDISTINCT(user_sender_id)`: Counts the number of unique `user_sender_id` values within each monthly partition. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
5.  `.ORDER_BY(month_as_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final result set by the `month_as_date` in ascending (chronological) order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'transaction')`**:
    *   This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection.

1.  Start with the `Coupons` collection.
2.  For each coupon, calculate:
    *   `coupon_code`: The actual code of the coupon (from the `code` field).
    *   `total_redemptions`: The number of times the coupon was used, which is the count of transactions linked to it via the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection.
    *   `total_amount_redeemed`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions where this coupon was used. This is obtained by summing the `amount` field from the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection.

    *   `coupon_code = code`: Selects the coupon's `code` and names it `coupon_code` in the output.
    *   `total_redemptions = COUNT(transaction_used_in)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each coupon through the `transaction_used_in` relationship. This count represents the total number of redemptions for that coupon.
    *   `total_amount_redeemed = SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions linked to the coupon. This represents the total monetary value redeemed using that coupon.
*   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())`: After calculating the above fields for all coupons, this function selects the top 3 coupons.
    *   `3`: Specifies that we want the top 3 results.
    *   `by=total_redemptions.DESC()`: Orders the coupons by the `total_redemptions` field (calculated in the previous step) in descending order, so the most frequently used coupons appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_info = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`:

    *   It filters these transactions using `.WHERE(sender_type == 0)` to include only those where the sender is a user.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then creates new fields for each of these filtered transactions:

        *   `sender_uid_field`: Stores the unique ID of the sending user (accessed via `sending_user.uid`), which will be used to count distinct users.
        *   `transaction_amount_field`: Stores the `amount` of the transaction.

2.  `country_grouped_transactions = transactions_info.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `transactions_info` (which contains user-sent transactions with their associated country, UID, and amount) and partitions it.
    *   `name=""country_transactions_group""` assigns a name to the partitioned groups.
    *   `by=(sender_country_field)` specifies that the transactions should be grouped based on the `sender_country_field` calculated in the previous step.

3.  `country_summary_metrics = country_grouped_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line operates on each group created by the `PARTITION` (i.e., for each country).
    *   It calculates the final metrics required for each country:
        *   `country = sender_country_field`: Assigns the country name for the output.
        *   `num_distinct_users_who_sent = NDISTINCT(transactions_info.sender_uid_field)`: Counts the number of unique sender UIDs within that country's group of transactions.
        *   `total_amount_sent_by_users = SUM(transactions_info.transaction_amount_field)`: Sums up all transaction amounts within that country's group.

1.  **Identify the latest balance for each merchant**: We access all merchant balance entries (`Merchants.balances`). For each merchant, we rank their balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order and select the top one. This gives us the most recent balance for every merchant who has balance records. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as this most recent balance.
2.  **Filter these latest balances based on merchant criteria**: From the set of latest balance entries, we keep only those whose associated merchant:
    *   Has `status == 'active'`.
    *   Has a `category` that contains 'retail'. The search for 'retail' is made case-insensitive by converting the category to lowercase.
3.  **Calculate the median**: For the final set of filtered balance entries, we calculate the median of their `balance` amounts. This will be a single value representing the requested median.

The query is structured to handle cases where merchants might not have balance entries or where no merchants meet the specified criteria (in which case the median would typically be null).

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_balance_entries = Merchants.balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing `Merchants.balances`, which represents the collection of all balance records for all merchants.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records.
    *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1` assigns a rank to each balance record within the group of balances belonging to the same merchant (`per=""Merchants""`). The ranking is based on `updated_at` in descending order, so rank 1 is the most recent balance entry.
    *   The result, `latest_balance_entries`, is a collection of `MerchantBalance` records, containing exactly one (the most recent) balance entry for each merchant that has any balance entries.

2.  `filtered_latest_balances = latest_balance_entries.WHERE((merchant.status == 'active') & CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail'))`:
    *   This line takes the `latest_balance_entries` from the previous step.
    *   It applies another `WHERE` clause to filter these entries further.
    *   The condition `merchant.status == 'active'` checks if the merchant associated with the balance entry is active.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail')` checks if the merchant's category (converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity) contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   The result, `filtered_latest_balances`, is a collection of `MerchantBalance` records from active, retail-related merchants, representing their latest balances.

3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_merchant_balance = MEDIAN(filtered_latest_balances.balance))`:

3.  We then partition these sessions by the `device_type` field. This groups all sessions that occurred on the same type of device.
4.  Finally, for each `device_type` group, we calculate the average of the `duration_seconds`.
5.  The result will show each `device_type` and its corresponding average session duration in seconds.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds.
# The device_type field is implicitly carried forward for partitioning.
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)
)

# Step 2: Partition by device_type and calculate the average session duration for each group.
# 'device_groups' is the name given to each partition.
# 'device_type' in CALCULATE refers to the partition key.
# 'AVG(device_groups.duration_seconds)' calculates the average of the 'duration_seconds'
# field for the records within each 'device_groups' partition.
average_duration_by_device_type = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(
    name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type)
).CALCULATE(
    device_type=device_type,
    avg_session_duration_in_seconds=AVG(device_groups.duration_seconds)
)
```
This PyDough code snippet will:
1.  Create an intermediate collection `sessions_with_duration` where each record from `UserSessions` has an additional field `duration_seconds` representing the session's length in seconds. The original `device_type` field is available for partitioning.
2.  Partition `sessions_with_duration` by `device_type`. Each partition is named `device_groups`.
3.  For each partition (i.e., for each unique `device_type`), calculate the `device_type` itself and the `avg_session_duration_in_seconds` by averaging the `duration_seconds` of all sessions belonging to that `device_type` group.
The final result is stored in `average_duration_by_device_type`.",79.7950644493103,"# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds.

1.  Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those who have at least one coupon using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
2.  For each of these merchants, we calculate:
    *   Their merchant ID (`mid`).
    *   Their registration date (`created_at`).
    *   The details of their earliest coupon. This is achieved by accessing the merchant's `coupons` sub-collection, selecting the coupon with the earliest `start_date` using `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`, and then using `.SINGULAR()` to treat this single coupon record as a singular object from which we can extract its `cid` and `start_date`.
3.  Next, we filter these merchants based on the timing of their earliest coupon:
    *   The coupon's `start_date` must be on or after the merchant's registration date (`earliest_c.start_date >= m_registration_date`).
    *   The coupon's `start_date` must be within one year of the merchant's registration date. This is checked by ensuring the `start_date` is less than or equal to the date one year after the registration date, calculated using `DATETIME(m_registration_date, '+1 year')`.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the required fields: `merchant_id`, `registration_date`, `earliest_coupon_id`, and `earliest_coupon_start_date`.

- The `WHERE` clause filters these users. The condition `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '1 year'))) == 1` works as follows:
    - `Users.created_at` refers to the signup date of the current user being evaluated.
    - `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '1 year')` calculates the date one year after the user's signup date.
    - `notifications.WHERE(created_at <= ...)` filters the user's notifications to include only those received on or before their first-year anniversary.
    - `HASNOT(...) == 1` checks if this filtered list of notifications is empty. If it is, the user did not receive any notification within their first year.
