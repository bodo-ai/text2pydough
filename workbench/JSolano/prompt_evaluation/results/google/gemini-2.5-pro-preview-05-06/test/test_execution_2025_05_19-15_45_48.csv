).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It filters these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions in total. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the number of transactions for each customer, and the `WHERE` clause keeps only those for whom this count is 5 or more.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This operation is performed on the filtered set of customers (those with >= 5 transactions).
    *   `customer_name=name`: It selects the `name` of each customer and assigns it to a new field `customer_name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the success rate for each of these customers.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be a successful transaction.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer. Due to the preceding `WHERE` clause, this count will be at least 5, preventing division by zero.
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted in ascending order based on the `success_rate`. Customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.

This query assumes that a transaction is considered ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to ""Completed"".",28.24278569221497,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"".
    *   They must have at least one 'BUY' transaction (`transaction_type == ""BUY""`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. The result will be a single number representing the count of these distinct customers.

1.  `faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple holding the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction that meets the subsequent criteria.

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined on or after January 1, 2023, and whose status is 'Active'. The `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` function is used to ensure the comparison includes the entire day of January 1, 2023, by setting the time to the beginning of the day.
2.  Partition these filtered customers by their `country`. This groups the customers based on their country of origin.
3.  For each country group, calculate the `country` and the count of customers within that group. This count represents the TAC for that specific country. The `COUNT(Customers)` function is used here to count the customers in each partition.

**Explanation:**

*   `active_customers_on_or_after_2023 = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `join_date >= DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")`: This condition selects customers whose join date is on or after January 1, 2023. `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` creates a datetime value for the beginning of January 1, 2023, ensuring accurate comparison even if `join_date` includes a time component.
    *   `status == ""Active""`: This condition further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers meeting both criteria are selected.

1.  **Establish Current Time Context**: We first calculate the start of the current week (`current_sow_val`) at the graph level. This will serve as a reference point for determining ""weeks ago"".
2.  **Filter and Augment Transactions**:
    *   Access all `Transactions`.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those related to stocks by checking `ticker.ticker_type == ""STOCK""`. (Assuming ""STOCK"" is the string representation for stock types).
    *   For each of these stock transactions, we calculate:
        *   `transaction_dt`: The actual date and time of the transaction.
        *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") for the transaction.
        *   `weeks_ago`: The number of weeks that have passed between the transaction's week and the current week. This is calculated using `DATEDIFF` between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, divided by 7.
3.  **Select Relevant Weeks**: We then filter these augmented transactions to keep only those where `weeks_ago` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive). This selects the 8 full weeks prior to the current week.
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered transactions are then partitioned by `transaction_week_start_dt`. This groups all transactions that occurred in the same week.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts**: For each weekly group (partition):
    *   We output `week_start_date` (which is the `transaction_week_start_dt` partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: We count all transactions within that week's group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: We count transactions within that week's group that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is done by filtering the group's transactions using `Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")))` and then counting them.
6.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

```python
# Define a graph-level calculation to get the start of the current week

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `graph_context = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining `current_sow_val` which represents the start date of the current week. This is calculated once at the `Broker` (graph) level.
2.  `relevant_transactions_with_week_info = graph_context.Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We access `Transactions` via `graph_context` so that `current_sow_val` is available. Transactions are first filtered to include only those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is ""STOCK"".
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on transactions): For each stock transaction, we derive:
    *   `transaction_dt`: The original transaction timestamp.
    *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week the transaction falls into.
    *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Saturday"").
    *   `weeks_ago`: Calculated by finding the difference in days between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, then dividing by 7. A value of 1 means last week, 2 means the week before last, and so on.
4.  `.WHERE((weeks_ago >= 1) & (weeks_ago <= 8))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that occurred in the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
5.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts = relevant_transactions_with_week_info.PARTITION(...)`: The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `transaction_week_start_dt`. Each partition represents a unique week.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on partitions): For each week's partition:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of that week (the partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific week's partition using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: Counts transactions within the current week's partition where the `day_name` (calculated earlier for each transaction) is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.
7.  `.ORDER_BY(week_start_date.DESC())`: The final result is ordered by the week start date in descending order, showing data for the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of last week. This is done by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), finding the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and then subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
        *   `_start_of_current_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week, which serves as the exclusive end boundary for last week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` clause builds upon the first one:
        *   It accesses `Customers` from the `Broker` collection.
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")` filters these customers to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made` then accesses all transactions made by these US-based customers.
        *   Another `.WHERE(...)` clause filters these transactions based on their `date_time`:
            *   `date_time >= _start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of last week.
            *   `date_time < _start_of_current_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current week.
        *   The result of this filtering is assigned to a temporary variable `_filtered_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   The third `CALCULATE` clause takes the `_filtered_transactions` collection:
        *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(_filtered_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions that met all the criteria.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these filtered transactions.

The final result, `last_week_transactions_summary`, will be a collection with a single row containing two columns: `number_of_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`, representing the requested data for customers from the USA for transactions made last week.",22.278549194335938,"# Define the start and end dates for ""last week""

    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to compute new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Include the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.
        *   `cr=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (`cr`). The `RANKING` function is used here:
            *   `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()`: Ranks customers based on their `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1).

The final `result` will contain the customer's name, their total number of transactions, their total transaction amount, and their rank based on the total transaction amount.",17.056471824645996,"customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This determines the first moment of the current month.
2.  `start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-6 months')`: This calculates the date 6 months before the start of the current month. For example, if ""now"" is in July, this will be the start of January.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and before `start_of_current_month`. This effectively selects customers from the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.
4.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))`: For these filtered customers, we calculate two new fields: `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`, representing the year and month of their `join_date`.
5.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))`: We group the customers based on the unique combinations of `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`. Each group (`monthly_group`) will contain all customers who signed up in a specific month.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each `monthly_group`:
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val, signup_month=signup_month_val`: We select the year and month for the group.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: We count the number of customers within the current `monthly_group`. `Customers` here refers to the sub-collection of customers belonging to this specific signup month. This gives us the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS).
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the average transaction `amount`. `Customers.transactions_made.amount` accesses all transaction amounts for all customers who signed up in this specific month. The `AVG` function then computes their average, giving us the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT). If customers in a particular month have no transactions, `pmat` will be null for that month.

2.  For these filtered daily prices, we extract the `ticker_type` from the associated `ticker` and the `close` price. These will be named `dp_ticker_type` and `dp_close_price` respectively.
3.  We then `PARTITION` this intermediate collection by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups all the records from the last 7 days by their ticker type.
4.  Finally, for each group (i.e., for each `ticker_type`), we `CALCULATE` the `ticker_type` (which is our partition key) and the `ACP` (Average Closing Price) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `dp_close_price` values within that group.

Explanation:
The PyDough code first creates an intermediate collection `daily_prices_filtered`. This collection contains records from `DailyPrices` that fall within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). For each such record, it includes the `ticker_type` (aliased as `dp_ticker_type`) and the `close` price (aliased as `dp_close_price`).

Next, the `result` is obtained by partitioning `daily_prices_filtered` by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups the data by ticker type. For each `ticker_type` group, the `CALCULATE` function then outputs the `ticker_type` itself and the Average Closing Price (`ACP`), which is computed by averaging the `dp_close_price` values belonging to that specific ticker type group from the `daily_prices_filtered` collection.",30.612668752670288,"# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days and select relevant fields (ticker_type and close price)

1.  **Filter Customers by Join Year**: Select only customers who joined in the year 2022.
2.  **Determine Transaction Status and Activity Status**: For these selected customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), False otherwise.
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's status is 'Active' (`status == 'Active'`), False otherwise.
3.  **Group by Country**: Partition the customers (with their flags) by their `country`.
4.  **Calculate Counts for AR**: For each country group:
    *   `num_active_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022, are 'Active', AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022 AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: Apply the formula: `AR = (num_active_with_transactions / num_total_with_transactions) * 100.0`. If `num_total_with_transactions` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  **Select Output Fields**: The final result will include the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

    )

result = activity_ratio_by_country
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_with_flags`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)` filters these customers to include only those who joined in 2022.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then processes these filtered customers to:
        *   Extract the `country` and assign it to `customer_country`.
        *   Create a boolean flag `has_transactions_flag`, which is true if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
        *   Create a boolean flag `is_active_flag`, which is true if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.

2.  `ar_components_by_country`:
    *   This step takes `customers_joined_2022_with_flags` and partitions them by `customer_country` using `PARTITION(name=""customers_in_country_group"", by=(customer_country))`. Each group, named `customers_in_country_group`, contains customers from the same country who joined in 2022, along with their calculated flags.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(...)` operates on each country group:
        *   `output_country_name = customer_country`: Selects the country name for the group.
        *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who are both active (`is_active_flag` is true) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the numerator for the AR.
        *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the denominator for the AR.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the per-country counts from the previous step.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio.
        *   It checks if `num_total_with_transactions` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.
        *   If it is, AR is calculated as `(num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions`.
        *   Otherwise (if `num_total_with_transactions` is 0), AR is set to `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and create a working version with aliased fields for clarity, including the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), transaction date/time, type, amount, tax, and commission.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions within the specified date range. ""Past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" is interpreted as the period from the start of the calendar month that was one month ago, up to the current date and time. For example, if today is July 15th, this range would be from June 1st to July 15th. This is achieved using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month', 'start of month')` for the start date and `DATETIME('now')` for the end date.
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: Partition the filtered sell transactions by their ticker symbol. This allows us to perform aggregations for each ticker.
4.  **Aggregate Financials per Ticker**: For each ticker group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_sell_amount` by summing the `amount` of sell transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_tax` by summing the `tax` associated with these transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_commission` by summing the `commission` for these transactions.
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values for each ticker, calculate the SPM with the provided formula:
    `SPM = (Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`
    This translates to:
    `SPM = (total_sell_amount - (total_tax + total_commission)) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`
    We will handle cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to 0.0 in such instances.
6.  **Format Output**: Select and return only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM` for each ticker.

1.  **Initial Data Preparation**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, we extract the ticker symbol from the related `Tickers` collection, the year, the month number (1-12), and create a formatted month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). We also carry forward the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Monthly Aggregation**: We partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and by each month (using year, month number, and the formatted month string as keys). For each resulting group (i.e., for each ticker for each month), we calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price using the respective aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) on the original daily prices that fall into that group.
3.  **MoMC Calculation**:
    *   The results from step 2 (monthly aggregates per ticker) are then partitioned again, this time only by ticker symbol. This gives us a series of monthly data for each ticker.
    *   Within each ticker's series of monthly data, we use the `PREV` window function to find the average closing price of the *previous* month. This function requires the data to be ordered by year and month number.
    *   Finally, using the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price (obtained via `PREV`), we calculate the MoMC. The formula is: `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`. We handle cases where the previous month's data is unavailable or its average closing price is zero by setting MoMC to `None`.

The final output will include the ticker symbol, the formatted month, the calculated average closing price, highest price, lowest price for that month, and the MoMC.

Within each stock's group of prices, it finds the ticker symbol, the absolute highest price (`max_high_val`), and the absolute lowest price (`min_low_val`) observed during that period. The difference between these two values gives the price change.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The first `CALCULATE` creates new fields for each customer:
        *   `c_id`: Stores the customer's `_id`.
        *   `c_name`: Stores the customer's `name`.
        *   `signup_year`: Extracts the year from the customer's `join_date`.
        *   `signup_month`: Extracts the month from the customer's `join_date`.
    *   The second chained `CALCULATE` then computes:
        *   `num_signup_month_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same year and month as their `join_date`.
            *   It accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which lists all transactions for that customer).
            *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where `YEAR(date_time)` matches `signup_year` and `MONTH(date_time)` matches `signup_month`.
            *   `COUNT(...)` then counts these filtered transactions.

2.  **`highest_transaction_customer = customer_join_transactions.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This takes the `customer_join_transactions` collection (which now includes each customer and their count of transactions in their signup month).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_signup_month_transactions.DESC())` selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `num_signup_month_transactions`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` then formats the output to return only the requested fields:
        *   `_id`: The customer's ID (from the previously calculated `c_id`).
        *   `name`: The customer's name (from `c_name`).

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `transaction_type` group created by the `PARTITION` step, this calculates:

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection, as each entry in this collection represents a unique customer.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction of type 'buy'. We can use the `HAS` function to check the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
    *   Inside `HAS`, we filter `transactions_made` for records where `transaction_type == 'buy'`.
3.  For the customers who meet this criterion, select their `_id` field, which is the customer's unique identifier.
4.  Rename the `_id` field to `customer_id` in the output as requested.

This approach ensures distinctness because we are iterating over the `Customers` collection, and each customer appears only once.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_with_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields:
    *   `cust_state`: This is derived from `customer.state`, accessing the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
    *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, accessing the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `partitioned_transactions = transactions_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transactions_with_details` collection.
    *   `name=""state_ticker_combinations""`: This assigns a name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(cust_state, tick_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the transactions based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

3.  `result = partitioned_transactions.CALCULATE(...).TOP_K(...)`:
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`) created by the `PARTITION` step:
        *   We select the `cust_state` and `tick_type` (which are the partition keys).
        *   We calculate `num_transactions` by counting the number of `Transactions` that fall into that specific group.
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())`: From these aggregated results, we select the top 5 combinations, ordered by `num_transactions` in descending order.

    *   This line defines a contextless expression named `vti_prices_in_range`.
    *   It starts with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records based on two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This ensures that only records for the ticker symbol 'VTI' are considered. It accesses the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` entity.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters records for the ""past 7 days"".
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` means we include records where the difference is 0 (today), 1 (yesterday), ..., up to 6 (6 days ago). This covers a total span of 7 calendar days.

2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:

    *   `CALCULATE(lowest_daily_close_price_vti_past_7_days=MIN(vti_prices_in_range.close))`:

        *   `MIN(vti_prices_in_range.close)` calculates the minimum value of the `close` attribute (closing price) from the records in the previously defined `vti_prices_in_range` collection.
        *   The term ""closest price"" from the natural language query has been interpreted as ""closing price"", as it's a standard field in daily price data.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)` clause filters these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction. `transactions_made` is a sub-collection of transactions for each customer. `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` evaluates to true if the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This function is used to select existing fields or derive new ones.
    *   **`_id=_id`**: We select the customer's original `_id` field.
    *   **`time_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: This calculates the new field `time_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: For each customer, this finds the minimum (i.e., earliest) `date_time` from all their transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection. This effectively gives the date of their first transaction.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:

        *   Occurred on the date ""2023-04-01"". This is checked by comparing the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` of the `date_time` field.
    *   We also select the customer's `_id` (as `customer_identifier`) and `name` (as `customer_name_val`) to carry them forward for the final output.

2.  **`top_customer_by_transactions = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `customer_transaction_counts` collection (which now includes each customer and their count of relevant transactions).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_sell_transactions.DESC())` selects the single customer (`k=1`) who has the highest `num_sell_transactions`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`transactions_for_period`)**:
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those that meet three conditions:
        *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures only successful transactions are considered.
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Restricts transactions to the year 2023.
        *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further restricts transactions to the first quarter (January, February, March).
    *   `CALCULATE` is then used to create two new fields:
        *   `transaction_year`: Extracted year from the `date_time` field.
        *   `transaction_month`: Extracted month from the `date_time` field.
        These fields are essential for grouping in the next step. The original `price` field of the `Transactions` collection remains accessible for aggregation.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`monthly_avg_price_data`)**:
    *   The `transactions_for_period` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`. This groups the transactions by each unique combination of year and month.
    *   Following the `PARTITION`, `CALCULATE` is used to compute the desired output for each group:
        *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
        *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
        *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average transaction `price` for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` field of the original `Transactions` records that belong to the current partition.

3.  **Final Selection (`result`)**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` ensures that the output contains precisely the requested columns: `year`, `month`, and the calculated `monthly_average_price` (renamed from `avg_transaction_price` for clarity).

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the time window for the ""last 8 calendar weeks, excluding the current week"". This involves calculating the start of the current week, then finding the start date of the 8-week period (8 weeks prior to the current week's start) and the end date of this period (which is the start of the current week, making the period exclusive of the current week). These boundaries are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level graph) context.
2.  **Filter Sales and Access Payments**: We select sales with a `sale_price` greater than $30,000 and then access their associated payments (`Sales.payment`).
3.  **Process Payments**: For each payment, we calculate:
    *   `payment_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the payment occurred.
    *   `is_weekend_day`: A boolean indicating if the payment was made on a Saturday or Sunday.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: We filter these processed payments to include only those whose `payment_week_start` falls within our defined 8-week period.
5.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**: The filtered payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start`. For each week, we calculate:
    *   `week`: The start date of the week.
    *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments in that week.
    *   `weekend_payments_received`: The count of payments made on a weekend in that week.

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to select only cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. The matching for `vin_number` will be case-insensitive by converting the `vin_number` to lowercase and searching for 'm5'. This addresses the ""LIKE with wildcards"" requirement for VIN.
2.  Group the filtered cars by their `make` and `model` using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars), calculate the total number of sales. This is done by counting the records in the `sale_records` sub-collection for all cars within that group.
4.  The final output will include the car's make, model, and the calculated total number of sales.

The instruction regarding case-insensitive and partial matching for `make` and `model` is interpreted to apply if these fields were used in a filter. Since they are used here as grouping keys, their original values will define the groups.

```python
# Filter cars where the VIN number contains 'M5' (case-insensitive)

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_in_vin = Cars.WHERE(CONTAINS(LOWER(vin_number), 'm5') == 1)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(vin_number), 'm5') == 1` checks if the lowercase version of the `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for the VIN. Only cars satisfying this condition are kept.

2.  `sales_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_in_vin.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))`:
    *   This takes the filtered `cars_with_m5_in_vin`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group is named `car_model_group`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` of the cars in the group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` of the cars in the group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for the current (make, model) group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` sub-collection of the cars within the current partition. `COUNT` aggregates these sales records across all cars in that specific (make, model) group that also met the VIN criteria.

We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29` for this. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days. If the sale date is today, the difference is 0. If it was 29 days ago, the difference is 29. Thus, `<= 29` covers a 30-day period including today.
3.  Use a contextless expression `recent_toyota_sales` to store these filtered sales.
4.  Finally, use the `Dealership` (the high-level graph collection) to `CALCULATE` the `COUNT` of these sales (as `number_of_sales`) and the `SUM` of their `sale_price` (as `total_revenue`).

```python
# Filter sales for Toyota cars made in the last 30 days (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `temp_first_name=first_name`, `temp_last_name=last_name`: We select the salesperson's first and last names, storing them in temporary variables.
    *   `temp_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: For each salesperson, we calculate the sum of `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (accessed via the `sales_made` sub-collection). This gives the total sales amount for that salesperson.
    *   `temp_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: We count the number of sales records in `sales_made` for each salesperson to get their total number of sales.

2.  `sales_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`: We take the result from the first `CALCULATE` step (which now includes `temp_first_name`, `temp_last_name`, `temp_total_sales`, and `temp_num_sales` for each salesperson).
    *   `first_name=temp_first_name`, `last_name=temp_last_name`, `total_sales_amount=temp_total_sales`, `number_of_sales=temp_num_sales`: We rename the temporary fields to the final requested output field names.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=temp_total_sales.DESC())`: We calculate the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied based on `temp_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC()`), so salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Finally, we sort the resulting collection of salespersons by their `total_sales_amount` in descending order, as requested.",36.014909744262695,"# Step 1: Calculate total sales and number of sales for each salesperson

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as we are interested in cars that have been sold and their sale prices.
2.  For each sale, retrieve the associated car's `make` and `model`.
3.  For each car associated with a sale, determine its latest inventory status. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the car's `inventory_snapshots`.
    *   Using the `RANKING` window function to find the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` for that specific car (`per=""car""`).
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to select this single latest snapshot.
    *   Checking the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot.
4.  Filter the sales records to include only those where the car's latest inventory status indicates it is no longer in inventory (i.e., `is_in_inventory == False`).
5.  Partition these filtered sales records by the car's `make` and `model`.
6.  For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` using `MAX(Sales.sale_price)`. This aggregates the original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records that fall into each partition group.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars`: We start by querying the `Cars` collection.
*   `.WHERE((LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")) )`: This filters the cars.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards for partial matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains ""ford"" OR its model contains ""mustang"".
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.

    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record.

Explanation:
1.  `initial_context`: We start by calculating `current_month_start_dt` (e.g., if today is 2023-06-15, this is 2023-06-01) and `six_months_ago_start_dt` (which would be 2022-12-01). These are global values for our query.
2.  `filtered_salespersons`: We select salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023.
3.  `relevant_sales`: We take the sales made by these `filtered_salespersons` and keep only those sales where `sale_date` is on or after `six_months_ago_start_dt` and before `current_month_start_dt`.
4.  `sales_with_month_info`: For each relevant sale, we extract `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month` (numerical year and month) and alias `sale_price` to `sale_price_val` for clarity in aggregation.
5.  `monthly_aggregated_data`: We partition (group) the `sales_with_month_info` by `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month`. For each month-group:
    *   `month`: A string representation like ""YYYY-MM"" is created for display.
    *   `PMSPS`: `COUNT(Sales)` counts the number of sales records in that month's group.
    *   `PMSR`: `SUM(sale_price_val)` sums the sale prices for that month's group.
6.  `final_result`: The aggregated data is ordered chronologically using the numerical `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month`. The final output will contain columns `month`, `PMSPS`, and `PMSR`.

3.  Calculate the average of the `sale_price` for these filtered sales.

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We use the `AVG` aggregation function on the `sale_price` of the `Sales` collection.
- The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only sales records where:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures the sales are from the year 2023.
    - `(MONTH(sale_date) >= 1) & (MONTH(sale_date) <= 3)` ensures the sales are from the first quarter (January, February, or March).
- The `AVG` function then computes the average of `sale_price` for these filtered sales.",6.635164260864258,"asp_q1_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(

2.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_diff=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `Dealership` top-level collection to calculate a single aggregated GPM value.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step:
    *   We determine the `total_revenue_for_2023_sales`. This is done by filtering the `Sales` collection for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023, and then summing their `sale_price`.
    *   We determine the `total_cost_for_2023_sales`. This involves filtering the `Sales` collection for 2023 sales, accessing the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale, and then summing these costs.
3.  In the second `CALCULATE` step, we use the `total_revenue_for_2023_sales` and `total_cost_for_2023_sales` computed in the previous step to apply the GPM formula.

The final result will be a single value representing the GPM for all sales in 2023.

```python
gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023_sales = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of cars sold in 2023
    total_cost_for_2023_sales = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_for_2023_sales - total_cost_for_2023_sales) / total_cost_for_2023_sales * 100
)
```
This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  It initializes a calculation at the `Dealership` level, which is suitable for global aggregations.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023_sales`: It filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales from the year 2023 (using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`) and then sums the `sale_price` of these sales.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023_sales`: Similarly, it filters sales from 2023 and then sums the `cost` of the `car` associated with each of these sales (accessed via `Sales.car.cost`).
3.  The second `CALCULATE` takes these two computed totals (`total_revenue_for_2023_sales` and `total_cost_for_2023_sales`) and applies the GPM formula: `(revenue - cost) / cost * 100`. The result is stored in the `gpm_2023` field.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as it contains information about sales, including the sale date, sale price, and the car sold.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the associated car has an inventory snapshot indicating it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the exact same date as the sale (`InventorySnapshots.snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`). We use the `HAS` function to check for the existence of such an inventory snapshot for the car linked to the sale.
3.  From these filtered sales, identify the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`. This will give us the single sale record that meets the criteria and has the maximum sale price.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to extract the `make` and `model` of the car (accessed via `Sales.car.make` and `Sales.car.model`) and the `sale_price` from this top sale record.

```python
# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the same day it went out of inventory

    *   If such an inventory snapshot exists, the `HAS` condition is true, and the sale is included.
2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: From the sales that meet the criteria, this selects the single sale record with the highest `sale_price`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=car.make, car_model=car.model, car_sale_price=sale_price)`: For the selected top sale, this extracts the car's make (from `Sales.car.make`), model (from `Sales.car.model`), and the `sale_price` of the sale, assigning them to new field names for clarity.",28.641461610794067,"# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the same day it went out of inventory

The MoM change is defined as the current month's total payments minus the previous month's total payments. The result should include all months that have payment data.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Augment Payment Data**:
    *   The `PaymentsReceived` collection is processed first.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to extract the `payment_year_val` (year of `payment_date`) and `payment_month_val` (month of `payment_date`) for each payment. These will be used for grouping.

2.  **Aggregate Payments by Month**:
    *   The augmented payment data (`payments_info`) is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(payment_year_val, payment_month_val))`. This groups all payments by their year and month.
    *   Within each group (each unique year-month), `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Output the year (`year_out`) and month (`month_out`).
        *   Calculate `total_payments_curr_month` by summing `PaymentsReceived.payment_amount` for all payments belonging to that specific year-month group.
    *   The resulting collection of monthly totals (`monthly_payment_totals`) is then ordered by year and month (`ORDER_BY(year_out.ASC(), month_out.ASC())`). This chronological sorting is essential for the correct operation of the `PREV` function in the next step.

3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    *   The sorted `monthly_payment_totals` collection is processed by another `CALCULATE` clause.
    *   For each month's record, it calculates:
        *   `year`, `month`: The year and month.
        *   `total_payments_for_month`: The total payments for that month (carried over from `total_payments_curr_month`).
        *   `mom_change_value`: This is the core MoM calculation. It's derived by subtracting the previous month's total payments from the current month's total payments.
            *   `PREV(total_payments_curr_month, by=(year_out.ASC(), month_out.ASC()), default=0.0)` is used to fetch the `total_payments_curr_month` from the immediately preceding row in the ordered collection.
            *   The `by=(year_out.ASC(), month_out.ASC())` argument ensures `PREV` respects the chronological order.
            *   `default=0.0` is crucial: for the very first month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), its ""previous month's total payments"" is treated as 0.0. Consequently, its MoM change will be its own total payment amount.

The phrase ""Return all months in your answer, including those where there were no payments"" is interpreted as returning data for all months present in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. If a calendar month has no payments, it will not appear in the result. The MoM calculation correctly handles the first available month and any subsequent months based on the data present.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those salespersons who have at least one sale record. This is important to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  The first `.CALCULATE(...)` then computes:
    *   `calc_first_name=first_name`: Retrieves the salesperson's first name.
    *   `calc_last_name=last_name`: Retrieves the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_sales_val=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their associated sales records (`sales_made`).
    *   `num_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by each salesperson.
3.  The second `.CALCULATE(...)` takes the output of the first and computes:
    *   `calculated_asp=total_sales_val / num_of_sales`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP) using the previously computed total sales value and number of sales. The `calc_first_name` and `calc_last_name` fields are carried over.
4.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 salespersons based on their `calculated_asp` in descending order.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `ASP`.",29.10924506187439,"# Filter salespersons who have made at least one sale and calculate total sales and number of sales

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `temp_id = _id`: The salesperson's ID.
    *   `temp_first_name = first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
    *   `temp_last_name = last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
    *   `temp_total_sales = SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: The total sales amount for the salesperson. `sales_made` is a sub-collection of sales records linked to the salesperson, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `SUM()` aggregates these prices.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Sorts the salespersons by `temp_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that if any salesperson has a NULL total sales amount, they are placed at the end of the sorted list (and thus are unlikely to be in the top 5).

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step selects the required fields and renames them as per the request for the output.

We'll filter for customers who have at least one entry in their `car_purchases` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` data). Then, we select their `_id` and rename it to `customer_id`.

```python
distinct_customer_ids_with_purchases = Customers.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1).CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers`**: We start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(car_purchases) == 1)`**: This filters the customers.
    *   `car_purchases` is a sub-collection on `Customers` that lists all sales made to that customer. This represents the ""join"" to the sales data.
    *   `HAS(car_purchases)` checks if this sub-collection is not empty, meaning the customer has made at least one purchase.
    *   `== 1` is used because `HAS` returns a boolean-like value (0 or 1).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: This operation selects and renames fields for the customers who passed the filter.
    *   `_id` is the field in the `Customers` collection that stores the customer's unique identifier.
    *   `customer_id=_id` selects this ID and renames it to `customer_id` in the output.
    *   Since each customer in the `Customers` collection is unique, and we are selecting the `_id` of customers who meet the criteria, the resulting list of `customer_id` values will be distinct.

4.  Filter these payments to find any where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
5.  If a salesperson has at least one sale with at least one cash payment, include their `_id` in the result.
6.  The result should be a list of these unique `_id`s.

The PyDough code will use the `HAS` function to check for the existence of related records meeting the criteria. By starting from the `Salespersons` collection and filtering, then calculating the `_id`, we inherently get a distinct list of salesperson IDs because each salesperson record is unique.

```python
distinct_salespersons_with_cash_payments = Salespersons.WHERE(
    HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    salesperson_id=_id
)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`: This is the core filtering logic:
    *   `sales_made`: Accesses the list of sales made by each salesperson.
    *   `.payment`: For each of those sales, accesses the list of payments received for that sale.
    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`: Filters these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if there is at least one such cash payment associated with any sale made by the salesperson. The `WHERE` clause then keeps only those salespersons who satisfy this condition.
3.  `.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id)`: For the salespersons who meet the criteria, this selects their `_id` and renames it to `salesperson_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_customer_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   `customer_state_from_sale=customer.state`: For each sale, it retrieves the state of the associated customer. `customer` is a link to the `Customers` collection.
    *   `current_sale_price=sale_price`: It takes the `sale_price` for the current sale.
    *   `customer_identifier=customer_id`: It takes the `customer_id` associated with the sale. This will be used for counting unique customers.

2.  `state_revenue_summary = sales_with_customer_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sales_by_state"", by=(customer_state_from_sale))`: This groups the records from `sales_with_customer_info` based on the `customer_state_from_sale`. Each group (partition) represents a unique state.
    *   `.CALCULATE(state=customer_state_from_sale, ...)`: For each state partition:
        *   `state=customer_state_from_sale`:  The name of the state.
        *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer_identifier)`: Calculates the number of distinct customers within that state by counting the unique `customer_identifier` values from the sales records belonging to that state's partition. `Sales` here refers to the sub-collection of sales records within the current partition.
        *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.current_sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for that state by summing the `current_sale_price` of all sales records within that state's partition.

3.  `top_states_by_revenue = state_revenue_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the `state_revenue_summary` (which contains state, unique customer count, and total revenue for all states).
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: It selects the top 5 records (states) ordered by `total_revenue` in descending order.

The final `top_states_by_revenue` variable will hold a collection of up to 5 records, each containing the state, the number of unique customers from that state who made purchases, and the total revenue generated from sales to customers in that state.",42.29361701011658,"# Step 1: Prepare sales data by extracting customer state, sale price, and customer ID for each sale.

3.  Group these sales by the car's `make` and `model`. This can be achieved using the `PARTITION` function.
4.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination), calculate:

top_selling_car_models = model_performance.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` from the associated `car` record and store them as `car_make_field` and `car_model_field` respectively. We also keep `sale_price` as `sale_amount` though it's not strictly necessary to rename it here as `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` will access the original field.
2.  `model_performance = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition these records by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. This groups all sales for the same car make and model together.
3.  `.CALCULATE(make=car_make_field, model=car_model_field, total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price), total_sales=COUNT(Sales))`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `make`: The make of the car.
    *   `model`: The model of the car.
    *   `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to this specific make and model group. `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` correctly refers to the `sale_price` of the `Sales` records within the current partition group.
    *   `total_sales`: The count of sales for this specific make and model group. `COUNT(Sales)` counts the number of `Sales` records within the current partition group.
4.  `top_selling_car_models = model_performance.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This takes the results from the previous step (which contains make, model, total revenue, and total sales for every car model) and selects the top 5 entries, ordered by `total_revenue` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Salespersons` collection. The `WHERE` clause filters these salespersons.
    *   `HAS(sales_made.WHERE((sale_date >= DATETIME('now', '-3 months')) & (sale_date <= DATETIME('now')))) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider salespersons who have made at least one sale in the specified period.
        *   `sales_made` is the sub-collection of sales for each salesperson.
        *   The inner `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
            *   `sale_date >= DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`: Includes sales that occurred on or after 3 months ago from the current date and time.
            *   `sale_date <= DATETIME('now')`: Includes sales that occurred up to the current date and time.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each salesperson who meets the `WHERE` condition, we calculate new fields:
    *   `first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(...).sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue. It sums the `sale_price` from the `sales_made` sub-collection, but only for sales falling within the same 3-month period defined earlier.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(...))`: Counts the number of sales made by the salesperson within that same 3-month period.

This assumes that the `start of week` configuration in PyDough aligns with Monday, as per ISO 8601 standards.
2.  **Filter Payments**: Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated boundaries of the previous ISO week.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For the filtered payments, we'll create fields to be used as keys for partitioning:
    *   A `payment_day_key` by truncating the `payment_date` to its day component (e.g., using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`).
    *   A `payment_method_key` directly from the `payment_method` field.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: Partition the prepared payment records by `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`. For each resulting group (i.e., for each unique day and payment method combination within the previous week), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.
5.  **Format Output**: The final result will show the specific day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

```python
# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.
# We assume DATETIME(..., 'start of week') considers Monday as the start of the week,
# aligning with ISO 8601 week definition.
date_boundaries_calc = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    previous_iso_week_start_date = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-7 days'),
    previous_iso_week_end_date = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-1 day')

    payment_method = payment_method_key, # Output: The payment method
    total_daily_amount = SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount) # Output: Sum of payments for that day & method

result = daily_payments_by_method
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries_calc`: This initial `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` collection determines the `previous_iso_week_start_date` (Monday of the previous week) and `previous_iso_week_end_date` (Sunday of the previous week). This relies on `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` correctly identifying the start of the current week, and assumes it aligns with ISO standards (Monday start).
2.  `payments_in_previous_week_prepared`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated `previous_iso_week_start_date` and `previous_iso_week_end_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` prepares two new fields:
        *   `payment_day_key`: This truncates the `payment_date` to the start of its day, allowing us to group payments by the specific calendar day.
        *   `payment_method_key`: This is simply the `payment_method` and will be used for grouping.
3.  `daily_payments_by_method`: This is the core of the aggregation.
    *   We `PARTITION` the `payments_in_previous_week_prepared` collection. The `by` clause uses `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`, effectively creating groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on these partitions:
        *   `payment_date`: Takes the value of `payment_day_key` for the output.
        *   `payment_method`: Takes the value of `payment_method_key` for the output.
        *   `total_daily_amount`: Calculates the `SUM` of `payment_amount` from the original `PaymentsReceived` collection, but summed only for the records belonging to the current partition (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
4.  `result`: The variable `result` holds the final dataset, where each row represents a unique day and payment method from the previous ISO week, along with the total payment amount received for that combination.",55.11368775367737,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_base_data`: Filters sales to include only those from the year 2023. It then calculates `customer_state_attr` (customer's state), `sale_month_attr` (month of sale), and `sale_year_attr` (year of sale).
2.  `sales_with_quarter_month`: Takes the previous result and calculates `q_start_month_attr`, which is the first month number of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, etc.).
3.  `sales_for_partition`: Constructs `quarter_date_key`, a string representing the first day of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This uses `JOIN_STRINGS` to combine the year, the formatted quarter start month (using `LPAD` to ensure two digits), and ""01"" for the day.
4.  `quarterly_sales_by_state`: This is the final step.
    *   It partitions the `sales_for_partition` data using `customer_state_attr` and `quarter_date_key` as grouping keys.
    *   Within each group (a unique combination of state and quarter), it calculates:
        *   `state`: The customer's state.
        *   `quarter_representation`: The string representing the first date of the quarter.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales falling into that specific state and quarter. `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates values from the original `Sales` collection context corresponding to the records in each partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection and aims to calculate new fields for each drug.
    *   **`drug_name_val=drug_name`**: Selects the name of the drug and assigns it to `drug_name_val`.
    *   **`avg_ddd_val=AVG(...)`**: Calculates the average Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each drug. This is an aggregation.

2.  **`treatments_used_in`**: For each drug, it accesses the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which lists all treatments where this drug was used.

3.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments:
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`**: Calculates the duration of the treatment in days. It ensures this duration is positive to avoid division by zero or negative duration when calculating DDD, which would be meaningless for ""total days of treatment"".

4.  **`.CALCULATE(ddd_per_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment:
    *   It calculates the individual DDD for that specific treatment.
    *   **`ddd_per_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`**: This is the core DDD formula: total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) divided by the total days of treatment (calculated as the difference between `end_dt` and `start_dt` in days).

5.  **`.ddd_per_treatment`**: After calculating `ddd_per_treatment` for each valid treatment, this expression makes the calculated DDD value available for the outer `AVG` function.

6.  **`AVG(...)`**: The `AVG` function then computes the average of all `ddd_per_treatment` values for the current drug, yielding the `avg_ddd_val`.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name_val` and its corresponding `avg_ddd_val`.

    *   `biologic_drug_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among treatments in that month where the `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.

5.  **Order Results**: The final results will be ordered by month in descending order (i.e., the most recent of the three months will appear first).

1.  Define the relevant time period:
    *   The end of the period (exclusive) is the start of the current month.
    *   The start of the period (inclusive) is 6 months prior to the start of the current month.
2.  Filter the `Patients` collection to find patient(s) with the first name ""Alice"".
3.  Access the `treatments_received` for these patient(s).
4.  Filter these treatments based on their `start_dt` falling within the defined time period.
5.  Count the number of such treatments.

The final result will be a single number representing this count.

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month.
# end_dt_exclusive is the first day of the current month.
end_dt_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
# start_dt_inclusive is 6 months before the first day of the current month.

        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `end_dt_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines a variable `end_dt_exclusive`. It uses the `DATETIME` function to get the current timestamp (`'now'`) and then truncates it to the 'start of month'. This effectively gives us the first moment of the current month, which will serve as the exclusive upper bound for our date filter.
2.  `start_dt_inclusive = DATETIME(end_dt_exclusive, '-6 months')`: This line defines `start_dt_inclusive`. It takes the `end_dt_exclusive` (start of the current month) and subtracts 6 months from it. This gives us the first moment of the month that was 6 months ago, serving as the inclusive lower bound for our date filter.
3.  `alice_treatment_count = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`), which is suitable for producing a single aggregated result.
4.  `num_treatments_last_6_months = COUNT(...)`: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `num_treatments_last_6_months`. Its value will be the count of treatments that meet the specified criteria.
5.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only those patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
6.  `.treatments_received`: From the filtered patients, we access their associated treatments through the `treatments_received` sub-collection.
7.  `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_dt_inclusive) & (start_dt < end_dt_exclusive))`: This filters the treatments further. A treatment is included if its `start_dt` (start date) is on or after `start_dt_inclusive` AND before `end_dt_exclusive`. This ensures we only count treatments within the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.
8.  `COUNT(...)`: The `COUNT` function then counts how many treatments remain after all filters have been applied. This count is assigned to `num_treatments_last_6_months`.",29.02987504005432,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month.

1.  **Calculate Distinct Drugs per Doctor**: For each doctor, we first determine the number of unique drugs they have prescribed. This is done by accessing their `prescribed_treatments`, then the associated `drug` for each treatment, and finally counting the number of distinct `drug_id`s.
2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We then group the doctors by their `speciality`. This creates logical groups within which ranking will occur.
3.  **Rank Doctors within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` in descending order (more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per=""specialty_group""` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures the rank is computed relative to other doctors in the same specialty.

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_with_drug_counts`: This initial step processes the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it retains their `doc_id` and `speciality`, and calculates `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` by counting the unique `drug_id`s from their `prescribed_treatments`.
2.  `doctors_partitioned_by_specialty`: This step takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection and partitions it by `speciality`. The result is a new collection where each item represents a unique specialty, and contains a sub-collection of doctors belonging to that specialty. This partition is named `specialty_group`.
3.  `ranked_doctors_in_specialty`: We then access the sub-collection of doctors within each `specialty_group` (this sub-collection is implicitly named `doctors_with_drug_counts`, matching the input collection to `PARTITION`). On this sub-collection, we perform a `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It selects `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed`.
    *   It computes `SDRSDR` using the `RANKING` function. `by=num_distinct_drugs_prescribed.DESC()` ensures that doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a better (lower numerical) rank. `per=""specialty_group""` ensures this ranking is performed independently within each specialty.
4.  `result`: The final variable `result` holds the collection of all doctors, each with their `doc_id`, `speciality`, the total number of distinct drugs they prescribed, and their rank (`SDRSDR`) within their specialty.",57.93164372444153,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This starts by accessing the `Doctors` collection and then filters its records based on the conditions provided in the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `first_name` starts with 'j'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
3.  **`CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `last_name` contains the substring 'son'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
4.  **`|`**: This is the logical OR operator, combining the two conditions. A doctor will be included if their first name starts with 'j' OR their last name contains 'son'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this selects and renames the required fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window**:
    *   `current_month_start_expr = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: Calculates the first day of the current month.
    *   `twelve_months_ago_start_expr = DATETIME(current_month_start_expr, '-12 months')`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 12 months before the start of the current month.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_in_relevant_window`)**:
    *   `Treatments.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Treatments` collection to include only records where `start_dt` is within the last 12 full months (i.e., greater than or equal to `twelve_months_ago_start_expr` and less than `current_month_start_expr`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `treatment_year_month_str`: Creates a string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") from `start_dt`. `LPAD` is used to ensure the month is always two digits for correct sorting and formatting. This effectively truncates `start_dt` to the month for aggregation.
        *   `patient_id_for_calc=patient_id`: Makes the `patient_id` available under a new name for use in the subsequent `PARTITION` step, which is good practice to avoid ambiguity.

3.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics (`monthly_diagnoses_and_treatments`)**:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_data_group"", by=(treatment_year_month_str))`: Groups the `treatments_in_relevant_window` data by the `treatment_year_month_str`. Each group represents a unique month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each monthly group:
        *   `year_month_period=treatment_year_month_str`: Selects the year-month string for the output.
        *   `PMTC=COUNT(Treatments)`: Calculates the Per Month Treatment Count (PMTC) by counting all treatments within that month's group.
        *   `PMPD=NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_for_calc)`: Calculates the Per Month Patient Diagnoses (PMPD) by counting the number of unique patient IDs (`patient_id_for_calc`) who received treatments (and thus diagnoses) in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(year_month_period.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the year-month period.

4.  **Assign to `result`**:
    *   The final result containing `year_month_period`, `PMTC`, and `PMPD` for each of the last 12 months (excluding the current month) is assigned to the `result` variable.",29.265273571014404,"# Define expressions for the start of the current month and 12 months prior

3.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI is calculated as the number of new patients in that year minus the number of new patients in the previous year.

    *   This line filters the `Outcomes` collection.
    *   It keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. This resulting collection, `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`, is used for subsequent average calculations.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`

    *   `avg_overall_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.
    *   `avg_overall_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.

2.  **`PIC=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `PIC` (private insured patient count) which will store the result of the count.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Female"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`**:
    *   We access the `Patients` collection.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

2.  Partition the patients by their `ins_type`. This creates groups for each insurance type.
3.  For each insurance type group:
    a.  Calculate `avg_pasi_score_d100`:

        *   Take the `day100_pasi_score` from these outcome records.
        *   Calculate the average (`AVG`) of these `day100_pasi_score` values. `AVG` will typically ignore NULL scores.
    b.  Calculate `num_distinct_patients`:
        *   Count the number of patients within the current insurance type group who have at least one treatment (`HAS(treatments_received...`) that ended in the year 2022 (`YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Diagnoses.WHERE(HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas) == 1)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Diagnoses` collection.
    *   Filters these diagnoses to include only those for which there is at least one associated treatment (`treatments_for`) that has at least one outcome record (`outcome_records`) with a non-null `day100_itch_vas` score. This ensures we only consider diagnoses with relevant data for the itch score.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each filtered diagnosis, this step calculates three new fields:
        *   `diagnosis_name_val=diag_name`: Retrieves the name of the diagnosis.
        *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with all treatments for the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function will consider all non-null scores.
        *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.WHERE(HAS(outcome_records.day100_itch_vas) == 1).patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the current diagnosis. It specifically counts patients whose treatments (`treatments_for`) have at least one outcome record with a non-null `day100_itch_vas` score. This ensures the patient count is relevant to the itch score being analyzed.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Start with Drugs**: The query begins with the `Drugs` collection, as we are interested in information about drugs.
2.  **Calculate Metrics per Drug**:
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields for each drug:
        *   `drug_name`: This is the original name of the drug.
        *   `number_of_treatments`: This is calculated by counting the number of associated treatments for each drug using `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`. The `treatments_used_in` field is a sub-collection linking drugs to their treatments.
        *   `average_drug_amount`: This is calculated by taking the average of the `tot_drug_amt` (total drug amount) from all associated treatments for each drug, using `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`.
3.  **Select Top 5 Drugs**:

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three main conditions:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. This will be checked case-insensitively using `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with wildcards (`%psoriasis%`).
    *   **Drug Condition**: The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We'll infer this by checking if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field in the `Drugs` collection (accessed via `Treatments.drug`) exists and is not null using `HAS()`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The treatment must have an `end_dt` that falls within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). We also ensure `end_dt` exists using `HAS()`.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the top `DermTreatment` level.

```python
# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)

)

# Calculate the total number of such treatments
count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions within the `WHERE` clause must be true for a treatment to be included.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition checks the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with each treatment. `LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name)` converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')` then checks if this lowercase name contains ""psoriasis"" anywhere within it (due to the `%` wildcards).
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition verifies that the `drug` used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function returns true if the field exists and is not null, which we interpret as the drug being FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded before attempting date comparisons.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current moment. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` is on or before the current moment, meaning it has indeed ended.

2.  `count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`: This calculates the total number of treatments present in the `filtered_treatments` collection and assigns this count to a new field named `num_treatments`.

    a.  Access their `prescribed_treatments`.
    b.  Identify the ""first treatment"" by finding the treatment with the earliest `start_dt`. We use the `RANKING` function, ordering by `start_dt` in ascending order, partitioned per doctor. We select the treatment where `RANKING(...) == 1`.
    c.  Use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this first treatment as a single record, allowing access to its fields.
4.  In the final `CALCULATE` step, select the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`.
5.  Extract the `start_dt` (as `first_treatment_date`) and `treatment_id` (as `first_treatment_id`) from the first treatment record. We use `DEFAULT_TO(..., None)` to gracefully handle cases where a doctor might not have any treatments, in which case these fields will be null.

The problem asks for ""first treatment (... _id)"". The `Treatments` collection has `treatment_id` as its identifier, so we will use that.

```python
# Filter doctors who were registered 2 years ago from the current year.
doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(year_reg == (YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2))

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(year_reg == (YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2))`: This line filters the `Doctors` collection. It selects doctors whose `year_reg` (year of registration) is exactly 2 years before the current year (obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`).
2.  The first `CALCULATE(...)` call operates on these filtered doctors:
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`, `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: These lines temporarily store the doctor's last name and year of registration.
    *   `first_treatment_record=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1).SINGULAR()`: This is the core logic for finding the first treatment.
        *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1)`: Filters these treatments.
            *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)`: Assigns a rank to each treatment based on its `start_dt` in ascending order (earliest first). The ranking is done `per=""Doctors""`, meaning it's done independently for each doctor's list of treatments. `allow_ties=False` ensures that if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, only one is ranked as 1.
            *   `== 1`: Selects only the treatment(s) with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record, or empty if no treatments) into an accessible singular record. If no treatments match, `first_treatment_record` will be effectively null.
3.  The second `CALCULATE(...)` call formats the final output:
    *   `last_name=doc_last_name`, `year_of_registration=doc_year_reg`: Selects the doctor's last name and year of registration, using the desired output field names.
    *   `first_treatment_date=DEFAULT_TO(first_treatment_record.start_dt, None)`: Retrieves the `start_dt` from the `first_treatment_record`. If `first_treatment_record` is null (e.g., the doctor has no treatments), this defaults to `None`.
    *   `first_treatment_id=DEFAULT_TO(first_treatment_record.treatment_id, None)`: Retrieves the `treatment_id` from the `first_treatment_record`. Similarly, defaults to `None` if there's no first treatment.

This query will return a list of doctors registered 2 years ago, along with their last name, registration year, and the date and ID of their earliest treatment.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `AdverseEvents` collection and applying a filter.
2.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt) <= 10`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `treatment.start_dt`: Accesses the `start_dt` (start date) of the treatment associated with the adverse event.
    *   `reported_dt`: Refers to the `reported_dt` (reported date) of the adverse event itself.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", ..., ...)`: Calculates the difference in days between the treatment start date and the adverse event reported date.
    *   `<= 10`: Ensures that we only include adverse events that occurred on or within 10 days after the treatment started.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this step selects and renames the fields to be returned.
    *   `treatment_id_val=treatment.treatment_id`: Selects the `treatment_id` from the associated treatment and names it `treatment_id_val`.
    *   `treatment_start_dt_val=treatment.start_dt`: Selects the `start_dt` from the associated treatment and names it `treatment_start_dt_val`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`conmed_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment`**: This contextless expression defines the condition for a concomitant medication to be considered as starting ""within 2 weeks"" of the main treatment. It calculates the absolute difference in days between the treatment's start date (`Treatments.start_dt`) and the concomitant medication's start date (`start_dt` within the `concomitant_meds` context). If this difference is 14 days or less, the condition is true.

    *   `treatment_end_dt = end_dt`: Selects the `end_dt` of the placebo treatment.
    *   `all_concomitant_meds_usage = concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`: This part handles the request to ""also return the start and end dates of all concomitant drug usage."" For each qualifying placebo treatment, it accesses its `concomitant_meds` sub-collection (which includes *all* concomitant meds for that treatment, not just those meeting the 2-week condition) and calculates:

Explanation:

1.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""male"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`: This line filters the `Patients` collection to select only records where the `gender` field is equal to ""male"" AND the `ins_type` field is equal to ""private"".
2.  `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each patient passing the filter, this calculates a new field `current_age_in_years`. The age is determined by the `DATEDIFF` function, which computes the number of full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (obtained via `DATETIME('now')`).
3.  `patients_filtered_with_age`: This intermediate variable holds the collection of filtered patients, each with their calculated `current_age_in_years`.
4.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(avg_patient_age = AVG(patients_filtered_with_age.current_age_in_years))`: This line calculates the final result. It accesses the `DermTreatment` graph (the top-level collection) to compute a single aggregated value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to compute intermediate values for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name and assigns it to `merchant_name`.
    *   `distinct_coupons_count=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of unique coupons used in successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""SUCCESSFUL"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""SUCCESSFUL"" and have an associated coupon (checked using `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
        *   `.coupon.cid`: Accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the coupon associated with each of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `distinct_transactions_count=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of unique successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""SUCCESSFUL"")`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""SUCCESSFUL"".
        *   `.txid`: Accesses the `txid` (transaction ID) of these transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique transaction IDs.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one and computes the final CPUR.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: This ensures `merchant_name` is included in the final output.
    *   `cpur=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(distinct_transactions_count > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This is a conditional expression. If `distinct_transactions_count` is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division. Otherwise (if it's 0, to prevent division by zero), CPUR is set to `0.0`.
        *   `distinct_coupons_count / distinct_transactions_count`: This is the CPUR formula.

1.  **Define Target Weeks**: First, we calculate the start dates of the three weeks preceding the current week. These will be used to filter notifications. We use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to make these dates available for subsequent operations.
2.  **Filter Users**: We select users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Access Notifications**: For these selected users, we access their `notifications`.
4.  **Enhance Notification Data**: For each notification, we calculate two new pieces of information:
    *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start of the week in which the notification was created. This is done by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_on_weekend`: A boolean flag indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME(created_at)`.
5.  **Filter Notifications by Target Weeks**: We then filter these processed notifications to include only those whose `notification_actual_week_start` falls into one of the three target weeks defined in step 1.
6.  **Group by Week**: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by their `notification_actual_week_start`. This creates a group for each relevant week.
7.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each weekly group, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for that group.
    *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications in that group (i.e., for that week).
    *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications within that group that were sent on a weekend. This is achieved by summing up a conditional value (1 if `is_on_weekend` is true, 0 otherwise).

This approach ensures that we count notifications only for the specified users, correctly identify the relevant weeks, and aggregate the total and weekend notification counts for each of those weeks.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and then apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   **`(status == ""active"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `status` is ""active"".
    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `category` is ""retail"". The `LOWER()` function is used on the `category` field to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, matching ""Retail"", ""retail"", ""RETAIL"", etc.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition filters for merchants who have at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS(coupons)` function returns true (or 1 in PyDough's boolean context) if the `coupons` sub-collection for a merchant is not empty.
    *   The `&` operator is used to combine these conditions, so a merchant must satisfy all three to be included.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use the `CALCULATE` function to specify the output fields.
    *   **`merchant_name=name`**: This selects the `name` field from the `Merchants` collection and renames it to `merchant_name` in the output.
    *   **`total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`**: This counts the number of coupons in the `coupons` sub-collection for each filtered merchant and names this count `total_coupons_issued`.

1.  **`us_users_recent_transactions = Users.WHERE(country == ""US"").transactions_sent.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Users` collection.
    *   `WHERE(country == ""US"")` filters these users to include only those whose `country` is ""US"".
    *   `.transactions_sent` accesses the transactions sent by these US users.
    *   Another `WHERE` clause is applied to these transactions:
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` filters transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` ensures that transactions from today (0 days diff), yesterday (1 day diff), ..., up to 6 days ago are included, covering a 7-day period.
    *   The result of this expression, `us_users_recent_transactions`, is a collection of transactions meeting these criteria.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  **Filter Relevant Balances**: First, we filter the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today and 7 days prior. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now'))` to ensure the difference is between 0 and 7 days.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: The problem defines AMB as ""average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". This means for each user, we need to average their balance entries that fall within the filtered 7-day period. We use `PARTITION` by `user_id` on the filtered balances. Then, for each user's group of balances, we calculate `AVG(UserBalances.balance)` to get their individual AMB for the period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, we take all the per-user AMB values calculated in the previous step and compute their average. This gives the overall ""average AMB for user wallets"". This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `amb_value` field from the collection of per-user AMBs.

The final result is a single value representing this average AMB.

1.  `Users.setting_snapshots`: We start by accessing the `setting_snapshots` linked to each user. This operation effectively flattens the snapshots into a single collection where each snapshot record is implicitly associated with its parent user.
2.  `.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This function is applied to each snapshot. It ranks snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first). The `per=""Users""` clause is crucial: it ensures that the ranking is performed *within* the group of snapshots belonging to each individual user (the ""Users"" ancestor collection).
    *   `== 1`: We filter the results to keep only the snapshots that have a rank of 1, meaning they are the latest snapshot for their respective user.
3.  `latest_snapshots_per_user.CALCULATE(user_id_val=user.uid, opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in)`:
    *   From the collection of latest snapshots (one per user who has snapshots), we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields.
    *   `user_id_val=user.uid`: We retrieve the user's unique identifier by navigating from the snapshot back to its parent user (`user`) and accessing its `uid` field. The result is named `user_id_val`.
    *   `opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in`: We retrieve the `marketing_opt_in` field directly from the snapshot. This field contains the boolean preference. The result is named `opt_in_status`.

This query will return a list of records, where each record contains the user ID and their marketing opt-in status as derived from their most recent settings snapshot. Users without any setting snapshots will not be included in the result.",31.782084941864014,"latest_snapshots_per_user = Users.setting_snapshots.WHERE(

This rank is based on the total amount of money successfully received by the merchant. We need to return the merchant's name, category, their total revenue amount, and this calculated rank.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue. This revenue comes from transactions:
    *   Where the merchant is the receiver (accessed via `transactions_received`).
    *   That were successful (we'll assume `status == ""completed""` indicates success).
    *   Where the `receiver_type` in the transaction data is `1` (as specified in the prompt, indicating the receiver is a merchant).
    The revenue is the sum of the `amount` for these transactions.
3.  After calculating the total revenue for each merchant, we rank them. The merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.
4.  The final output will include the merchant's name, category, the calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

We'll use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
*   The first `CALCULATE` computes the necessary attributes from the `Merchants` collection (name, category) and calculates the `total_revenue_for_merchant`.
*   The second `CALCULATE` takes these intermediate results, renames them to the desired output field names, and computes the `revenue_rank` based on the `total_revenue_for_merchant`.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate total revenue for each merchant from their successfully received transactions.
# We select the merchant's name and category, and sum the amounts from relevant transactions.
merchant_revenues_calculated = Merchants.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_revenues_calculated = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `m_name=name` and `m_category=category`: These select the merchant's `name` and `category`, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` for use in the next step.
    *   `total_revenue_for_merchant=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   `transactions_received`: This accesses the list of transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: This filters these transactions to include only those that are ""completed"" (assumed to mean successful) AND where the `receiver_type` is `1` (as per the prompt's requirement for merchant receivers).
        *   `.amount`: This accesses the `amount` of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the amounts of all such transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant.

2.  `final_merchant_data = merchant_revenues_calculated.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the result from the first `CALCULATE` step.
    *   `merchant_name=m_name`, `category=m_category`, `revenue_amount=total_revenue_for_merchant`: These lines select the fields calculated in the previous step and assign them their final output names: `merchant_name`, `category`, and `revenue_amount`.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue_for_merchant.DESC())`:
        *   `RANKING(...)`: This function calculates a rank for each merchant.
        *   `by=total_revenue_for_merchant.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the `total_revenue_for_merchant` (calculated in the first step), in descending order (`DESC()`), so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average number of daily active users within a given month.
An ""active user"" for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from the `Transactions` table where `sender_type` is 0 (indicating a user sender) and who made at least one transaction on that day.

The process involves these main steps:
1.  **Define Date Range**: Establish the time window for the analysis, which spans the two full calendar months immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is in July, the analysis period would be May 1st to June 30th.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this defined date range and have `sender_type = 0`. For these transactions, extract the year-month and day components from the `created_at` timestamp, and retain the `sender_id`.
3.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Group the filtered transactions by year-month and day. For each day, count the number of unique `sender_id`s. This gives the DAU for each day in the period.
4.  **Calculate PMDAU**: Group the daily DAU counts by year-month. For each month, calculate the average of its daily DAU values. This average is the PMDAU for that month.
5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in ascending order.

2.  **Group by User and Aggregate Durations**:

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable stores the result of filtering `UserSessions`. It includes only those sessions that started between June 1, 2023 (inclusive) and June 8, 2023 (exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_session_duration` which is the duration of that single session in seconds. The `user_id` is also explicitly selected to be used as a key in the next step.
2.  `user_aggregated_data`: This step takes `sessions_with_duration` and partitions it by `user_id`.
    *   `name=""user_partition_group""` gives a name to the groups within the partition.
    *   `by=(user_id)` specifies that sessions should be grouped based on their `user_id`.
    *   In the subsequent `CALCULATE` clause:
        *   `user_id_key=user_id` selects the partitioning key (the user's ID).
        *   `summed_duration_seconds=SUM(user_partition_group.calculated_session_duration)` calculates the total session time for each user by summing up the `calculated_session_duration` of all sessions belonging to that user within the partition group.
3.  `sorted_user_durations`: The data is then sorted by `summed_duration_seconds` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.
4.  `result`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested by the prompt. The `total_duration` will be an integer value representing seconds.",74.06163287162781,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by date and calculate duration for each session.

-   `Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection to find the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is 1.
-   `.coupons`: This accesses the list of coupons associated with the selected merchant.
-   `.CALCULATE(coupon_id=cid, total_transacted_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount))`: This operation is performed for each coupon of the selected merchant.
    -   `coupon_id=cid`: Selects the coupon's ID and renames it to `coupon_id`.
    -   `total_transacted_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all transactions linked to the current coupon via the `transaction_used_in` relationship. This sum is named `total_transacted_amount`.

1.  Identify the time window: This is from exactly one month ago up to the current moment (`now`).
2.  Filter the `UserSessions` collection to include only sessions where `session_start_ts` falls within this time window.
3.  Count the number of such sessions.
4.  The result will be a single value representing this total count.

Here's the PyDough code:

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_in_the_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sessions based on their `session_start_ts`.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` calculates the date and time exactly one month before the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` represents the current date and time.
    *   The condition `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))` ensures that we only select sessions that started on or after one month ago and on or before the current moment.

2.  `tuc_calculation = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line calculates the final TUC value.
    *   It uses `Ewallet.CALCULATE` because TUC is a single aggregate value for the entire dataset.
    *   `COUNT(sessions_in_the_past_month)` counts the number of records in the `sessions_in_the_past_month` collection (which are the sessions that met the time window criteria).
    *   The result of this count is assigned to a new field named `total_tuc_count`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date`: This variable defines the beginning of the previous month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncating it to the start of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracting one month (`'-1 month'`).
2.  `current_month_start_date`: This variable defines the end of the previous month (exclusive), which is equivalent to the beginning of the current month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp and truncating it to the start of the current month.
3.  `transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the `prev_month_start_date` (inclusive) and `current_month_start_date` (exclusive).
4.  `str_calculation_output = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This block performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` graph level, resulting in a single row.
    *   `num_successful_transactions`: Counts transactions from `transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is ""completed"". This is our definition of a successful transaction.
    *   `num_total_transactions`: Counts all transactions within `transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_str = ...)`: This chained `CALCULATE` uses the counts from the previous step to compute the STR.
    *   `IFF(num_total_transactions > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This conditional function checks if there were any transactions in the previous month.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `num_successful_transactions * 1.0 / num_total_transactions`. The `* 1.0` ensures floating-point division.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is 0 (to prevent division by zero), `calculated_str` is set to `0.0`.
6.  `result = str_calculation_output.CALCULATE(previous_month_str = calculated_str)`: This final step selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str`, and assigns it to the `result` variable, ensuring only the requested value is returned.",29.626418828964237,"# Define the start and end dates for the previous month

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each merchant.
    *   `merchant_id_val = mid` and `merchant_name_val = name`: These lines select the merchant's ID and name, aliasing them for clarity.
    *   `_merchant_creation_year = YEAR(created_at)` and `_merchant_creation_month = MONTH(created_at)`: These lines extract the year and month of the merchant's creation date. The underscore prefix is used to distinguish these calculated values.
    *   `num_matching_coupons = COUNT(coupons.WHERE(...))`: This calculates the number of coupons for the current merchant that satisfy the condition.
        *   `coupons.WHERE(...)`: This filters the sub-collection of `coupons` associated with the current merchant.
        *   `(YEAR(created_at) == _merchant_creation_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == _merchant_creation_month)`: This condition checks if the coupon's creation year and month (here, `created_at` refers to `Coupons.created_at`) are the same as the merchant's creation year (`_merchant_creation_year`) and month (`_merchant_creation_month`).

    total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
    *   `LOWER(country) == 'us'`: This condition filters users whose country is 'US', performing a case-insensitive comparison by converting the `country` field to lowercase.
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition ensures that the user has at least one notification that satisfies both sub-conditions:
        *   `notification_type == 'promotional'`: The notification's type must be exactly 'promotional'.
        *   `status == 'unread'`: The notification's status must be exactly 'unread'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two main conditions, so a user must be from the US AND have at least one relevant unread promotional notification.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the users who pass the `WHERE` clause, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   `username=username`: Selects the `username` of the user.
    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`: Counts the number of notifications for each selected user that are of type 'promotional' and have a status of 'unread'.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This will be the first day of the month of the transaction, derived using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will serve as our grouping key for months.
    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `month_as_date_obj`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (our partition key), representing the month.
    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.
5.  Finally, we order the results by `month_as_date_obj` in ascending order to get the counts from the earliest month first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection, as we are interested in properties of merchants.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1)`**: This filters the merchants.
    *   The `transactions_received` field in the `Merchants` collection is a list of transactions where the merchant was the receiver.
    *   The `HAS(transactions_received) == 1` condition checks if this list is not empty, meaning the merchant has received at least one transaction. This directly addresses the ""received money from a transaction"" requirement.
    *   This condition implicitly considers all transaction types because there is no filter applied to the `transaction_type` within the `transactions_received` sub-collection.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`**: This selects the desired information for the filtered merchants.
    *   It specifies that we only want the `mid` (merchant ID) for each merchant that satisfies the `WHERE` condition.
    *   The alias `merchant_id` is used for the output field, as requested.

Return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications.,SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM notifications WHERE type = 'transaction';,Ewallet,"To return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications, we will perform the following steps:
1.  Access the `Notifications` collection.
2.  Filter the notifications to select only those that are 'transaction' notifications. We'll assume the `notification_type` field will have a value like 'TRANSACTION' for this purpose.
3.  Group the filtered notifications by `user_id` using `PARTITION` to ensure distinctness.
4.  Select the `user_id` from these groups.

```python
distinct_user_ids_with_transaction_notifications = Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION').PARTITION(name=""users_partition"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(user_id)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION')`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection and filters it to include only records where the `notification_type` field is equal to 'TRANSACTION'. This step isolates notifications that are specifically related to transactions. (Note: 'TRANSACTION' is assumed to be the value representing transaction-related notifications).
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""users_partition"", by=(user_id))`: After filtering, this applies a `PARTITION` operation. It groups the remaining notification records by the `user_id` field. The `name=""users_partition""` assigns a temporary name to these groups, and `by=(user_id)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on unique user IDs.
3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id)`: Finally, this `CALCULATE` clause is applied to the result of the `PARTITION`. For each partition (i.e., for each unique `user_id` that has a 'TRANSACTION' type notification), it selects the `user_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users`**: We start by accessing the `Users` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(notifications) == 1)`**: This filters the `Users` collection.
    *   `notifications` refers to the sub-collection of notifications linked to each user.

1.  **Identify Relevant Merchants and Their Latest Balances**:
    *   Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those that are 'active' and whose `category` field contains the string 'retail'.
    *   Ensure that these merchants have at least one balance record using `HAS(balances) == 1`.
    *   For each of these qualifying merchants, determine their most recent balance. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as the balance amount from the `MerchantBalances` record with the latest `updated_at` timestamp for that merchant.
    *   This is achieved by accessing the merchant's `balances` sub-collection, ranking the balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order (this ranking is done per merchant using `per=""Merchants""`), selecting the entry with rank 1 (the latest), and then extracting its `balance` value using `SINGULAR()`.
    *   This process results in a temporary collection, `active_merchants_latest_balances`, where each row corresponds to a qualifying merchant and contains their `latest_balance_amount`.

2.  **Calculate the Median Balance**:
    *   Using the `Ewallet` (top-level) context, calculate the median of all `latest_balance_amount` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` function will compute a single value representing the median wallet balance across all selected merchants. If any `latest_balance_amount` is null, it will be ignored in the median calculation.

Here's the PyDough code to calculate the average user session duration in seconds, split by device type:

).CALCULATE(
    device_type = device_type,
    avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_by_device.duration_seconds)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection called `session_durations`.
    *   Inside `CALCULATE`, we select the `device_type`.
    *   We calculate `duration_seconds` for each session using the `DATEDIFF` function. `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` computes the difference between the session end time and start time in seconds.

2.  **`average_session_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `session_durations` collection (which now includes `duration_seconds`).
    *   We use `PARTITION` to group the sessions.
        *   `name=""sessions_by_device""`: This names the groups created by the partition.
        *   `by=(device_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the sessions based on their `device_type`.
    *   After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` again on these groups:
        *   We select the `device_type` (which is our partition key).
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_by_device.duration_seconds)`: For each `device_type` group, we calculate the average of the `duration_seconds` values. We access the `duration_seconds` from the partitioned data using `sessions_by_device.duration_seconds` (where `sessions_by_device` is the name we gave to our partition).

The final result, `average_session_duration_by_device`, will contain each `device_type` and its corresponding average session duration in seconds.",7.543720483779907,"# Calculate the duration of each session in seconds
