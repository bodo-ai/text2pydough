**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by selecting the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer who meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"".
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the results (customers with their names and success rates) are ordered by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).",20.45753836631775,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`**:
    This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols`, which stores the ticker symbols for FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to read.

2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    This part of the query starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these customers based on two conditions combined with a logical AND (`&`):
    *   **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`**:
        *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions made by each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: This filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (the symbol of the stock involved in the transaction) is one of the symbols listed in the `faang_symbols` tuple (i.e., ""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", or ""NFLX"").
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the customer has at least one transaction that matches the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., at least one FAANG stock transaction).

    The `filtered_customers` variable will hold the collection of customers who satisfy both the email condition and the FAANG stock transaction condition.

3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_distinct_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result at the `Broker` (top) level.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: This aggregation function counts the number of distinct customers present in the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `num_distinct_customers = ...`: The result of the count is assigned to a new field named `num_distinct_customers`.

    *   `join_date >= DATETIME('2023-01-01', 'start of day')`: This condition ensures that only customers whose `join_date` is on or after January 1, 2023, are included. `DATETIME('2023-01-01', 'start of day')` creates a datetime object representing the beginning of January 1, 2023.

1.  **Establish Current Time Context**: We first calculate the start of the current week (`current_sow_val`) at the graph level. This will serve as a reference point for determining ""weeks ago"".
2.  **Filter and Augment Transactions**:
    *   Access all `Transactions`.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those related to stocks by checking `ticker.ticker_type == ""STOCK""`. (Assuming ""STOCK"" is the string representation for stock types).
    *   For each of these stock transactions, we calculate:
        *   `transaction_dt`: The actual date and time of the transaction.
        *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") for the transaction.
        *   `weeks_ago`: The number of weeks that have passed between the transaction's week and the current week. This is calculated using `DATEDIFF` between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, divided by 7.
3.  **Select Relevant Weeks**: We then filter these augmented transactions to keep only those where `weeks_ago` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive). This selects the 8 full weeks prior to the current week.
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered transactions are then partitioned by `transaction_week_start_dt`. This groups all transactions that occurred in the same week.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts**: For each weekly group (partition):
    *   We output `week_start_date` (which is the `transaction_week_start_dt` partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: We count all transactions within that week's group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: We count transactions within that week's group that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is done by filtering the group's transactions using `Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")))` and then counting them.
6.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

```python
# Define a graph-level calculation to get the start of the current week

**Explanation:**

1.  `graph_context = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining `current_sow_val` which represents the start date of the current week. This is calculated once at the `Broker` (graph) level.
2.  `relevant_transactions_with_week_info = graph_context.Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We access `Transactions` via `graph_context` so that `current_sow_val` is available. Transactions are first filtered to include only those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is ""STOCK"".
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on transactions): For each stock transaction, we derive:
    *   `transaction_dt`: The original transaction timestamp.
    *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week the transaction falls into.
    *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Saturday"").
    *   `weeks_ago`: Calculated by finding the difference in days between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, then dividing by 7. A value of 1 means last week, 2 means the week before last, and so on.
4.  `.WHERE((weeks_ago >= 1) & (weeks_ago <= 8))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that occurred in the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
5.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts = relevant_transactions_with_week_info.PARTITION(...)`: The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `transaction_week_start_dt`. Each partition represents a unique week.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on partitions): For each week's partition:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of that week (the partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific week's partition using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: Counts transactions within the current week's partition where the `day_name` (calculated earlier for each transaction) is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.
7.  `.ORDER_BY(week_start_date.DESC())`: The final result is ordered by the week start date in descending order, showing data for the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries for ""Last Week""**: We use contextless expressions and the `DATETIME` function to define the start of the current week and the start of last week. ""Last week"" is the period from the start of last week (inclusive) up to the start of the current week (exclusive).
    *   `start_of_current_week_expr`: Calculated as the beginning of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_last_week_expr`: Calculated by subtracting 7 days from `start_of_current_week_expr`.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We create a contextless expression `filtered_us_transactions_last_week` that represents the set of transactions meeting all criteria:
    *   The transaction must be associated with a customer whose `country` is ""USA"". This is checked via `customer.country == ""USA""`.
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must be greater than or equal to `start_of_last_week_expr`.
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must be less than `start_of_current_week_expr`.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: We use `Broker.CALCULATE` (the top-level collection) to compute the final aggregates from the `filtered_us_transactions_last_week`:
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of transactions in the filtered set, obtained using `COUNT(filtered_us_transactions_last_week)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions in the filtered set, obtained using `SUM(filtered_us_transactions_last_week.amount)`.

This approach ensures that date calculations are clear and the filtering logic is applied efficiently before aggregation.

2.  **Partition by country**: Group the filtered customers by their `country`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_for_ar_calculation`: This line filters the `Customers` collection. It selects customers who meet two conditions:
    *   `YEAR(join_date) == 2022`: The customer joined in the year 2022.
    *   `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`: The customer has made at least one transaction.

2.  `country_level_stats`: This part takes the `customers_for_ar_calculation` and partitions them by `country`. For each country:
    *   `country_name=country`: The country name is selected.
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions=COUNT(Customers.WHERE(status == ""Active""))`: This counts how many customers within the current country partition (who already meet the join year and transaction criteria) have their `status` field as ""Active"".
    *   `total_customers_with_transactions=COUNT(Customers)`: This counts the total number of customers within the current country partition (all of whom meet the join year and transaction criteria). This forms the denominator for the AR.

3.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the Activity Ratio (AR) and formats the output:
    *   `country=country_name`: Selects the country name for the output.
    *   `AR=IFF(...)`: Calculates the AR using the formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
        *   `IFF(total_customers_with_transactions > 0, ... , 0.0)` is used to prevent division by zero. If a country has no customers meeting the criteria for the denominator (which shouldn't happen for countries appearing in `country_level_stats` due to prior filtering, but is a safe check), AR is set to 0.0. The multiplication by `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage.",50.82337880134583,"# Step 1: Filter customers who joined in 2022 and have at least one transaction.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the top-level `Broker` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers = COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_customers` that will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is applied to the `name` and `state` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name starts with 'j'.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`(... | ...)`**: The OR operator `|` combines the two name conditions, meaning a customer is selected if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
8.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
9.  **`(... & ...)`**: The AND operator `&` combines the name condition (the OR group) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.
10. **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` tallies the number of `Customers` records that satisfy all the specified conditions.",16.837287664413452,"count_of_customers = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  **Prepare Transactions Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and use `CALCULATE` to make the `ticker.symbol` available as a scalar field (`ticker_symbol_for_partition`). This field will be used for partitioning later. Original transaction fields like `transaction_type`, `date_time`, `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` are carried forward.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions where `date_time` is within the last month. This is achieved by checking if `date_time` is greater than or equal to one month ago from the current moment (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`) and less than or equal to the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`).
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate**:
    *   Use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions by `ticker_symbol_for_partition`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), use `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Preserve the ticker symbol (renamed to `ticker_symbol_output` for clarity).
        *   Calculate the sum of `amount` (as `total_amount_val`).
        *   Calculate the sum of `tax` (as `total_tax_val`).
        *   Calculate the sum of `commission` (as `total_commission_val`).
        These sums refer to the original fields of the `Transactions` collection within each partition.
4.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, calculate the SPM with another `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   The SPM formula is: `(Total Amount - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`.
    *   To prevent division by zero if `total_amount_val` is 0, an `IFF` condition is used: if `total_amount_val` is 0, SPM is set to 0.0; otherwise, the formula is applied. The result is stored in `spm_value`.
5.  **Final Output**: A final `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `ticker_symbol` and `spm`.

2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Group the prepared daily data by ticker symbol, year, and month. For each group, calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price. This results in a collection where each row represents one month of data for a specific ticker.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC Calculation**: Take the monthly aggregated data and group it by ticker symbol. This creates series of monthly data for each ticker.
4.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: Within each ticker's monthly series, use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month. This requires ordering the data by year and month.
5.  **Calculate MoMC**: Compute the MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - previous_month_avg_close) / previous_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker) or zero to avoid errors.

Explanation:
The query is constructed in several stages:
1.  `daily_price_details`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices` and calculate necessary attributes for each record: the ticker symbol (`ticker_sym_field` from the related `ticker` object), the year (`price_year_field`), and month (`price_month_field`) of the price date, along with the closing, high, and low prices.
2.  `monthly_aggregates`: This step takes `daily_price_details` and partitions it by `ticker_sym_field`, `price_year_field`, and `price_month_field`. For each unique combination (i.e., for each ticker each month), it calculates the average closing price (`avg_c`), maximum high price (`max_h`), and minimum low price (`min_l`). The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a specific ticker.
3.  `result_with_prev_close`: This is a crucial step for calculating the Month-over-Month Change (MoMC).
    *   It takes `monthly_aggregates` and partitions it again, this time only by the ticker symbol (`ticker_s`). This groups all monthly records for each ticker together.
    *   The expression `.ticker_series_group.monthly_aggregates` accesses the series of monthly aggregate records belonging to the current ticker group.
    *   On this per-ticker monthly series, we use `CALCULATE` to pass through the existing monthly stats (`ticker_s_calc`, `year_m_calc`, `month_m_calc`, `avg_c_calc`, `max_h_calc`, `min_l_calc`).
    *   Crucially, it calculates `prev_avg_c_val` using the `PREV(avg_c, by=(year_m.ASC(), month_m.ASC()), per=""ticker_series_group"")` function. This function looks up the `avg_c` (average closing price) from the previous record within the same ticker's data, ordered by year and month. The `per=""ticker_series_group""` ensures that the `PREV` function resets for each new ticker.
4.  `final_ticker_monthly_performance`: The final `CALCULATE` step takes the output from `result_with_prev_close` and:
    *   Formats the month into ""YYYY-MM"" string using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD`.
    *   Selects the required fields: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, and `lowest_price`.
    *   Calculates `MoMC` using the current month's average closing price (`avg_c_calc`) and the previous month's average closing price (`prev_avg_c_val`). The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_avg_c_val` is `None` (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker) or zero, setting MoMC to `None` in such scenarios to prevent errors.

The final result, `final_ticker_monthly_performance`, will contain one row for each ticker for each month, including all the requested financial metrics. The data will be implicitly ordered by ticker symbol, then by year and month due to the partitioning and `PREV` function's ordering.",129.98985052108765,"# Step 1: Prepare daily data with necessary fields (ticker symbol, year, month, close, high, low)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_month_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `CALCULATE` method is used to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_identifier=_id`: Selects the customer's `_id` and renames it to `customer_identifier`.
        *   `customer_name_val=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name_val`.
        *   `transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions a customer made in the same calendar month and year they joined.
            *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It filters the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
            *   The `WHERE` clause condition `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))` ensures that only transactions where the transaction's year and month match the customer's `join_date` year and month are considered.
            *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts these filtered transactions.

2.  **`highest_transaction_customer = customer_join_month_transactions.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the result from the previous step (`customer_join_month_transactions`).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This selects the top 1 customer based on the `transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order. This effectively finds the customer with the highest number of transactions in their join month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` formats the output to return only the requested fields:
        *   `_id=customer_identifier`: The customer's ID.
        *   `name=customer_name_val`: The customer's name.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Filtering**:
    *   First, a `date_condition` is defined to filter transactions. It selects transactions where the `date_time` is on or after January 1, 2023, and before April 1, 2023. Using `DATETIME(<date_string>, 'start of day')` ensures comparisons are made from the beginning of the respective days. This range inclusively covers all transactions from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(date_condition)` applies this filter to the `Transactions` collection, resulting in `filtered_transactions_by_date`.

2.  **Grouping and Aggregation**:
    *   `filtered_transactions_by_date.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))` groups the filtered transactions based on their `transaction_type`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`:  The transaction type itself.
        *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT` is used on `customer_id` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
        *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG` is used on `shares` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
    *   This step results in `transaction_type_summary`, a collection where each row represents a transaction type with its associated distinct customer count and average shares.

3.  **Selecting Top 3**:
    *   `transaction_type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` takes the `transaction_type_summary` and selects the top 3 records.
    *   The ranking is based on `num_distinct_customers` in descending order (`DESC()`), so transaction types with more distinct customers rank higher.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The final `result` variable holds a collection containing the `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares` for the top 3 transaction types as requested.",39.32298445701599,"# Define the date range condition for filtering transactions

3.  To get a distinct list of `ticker_id`s from the filtered records, we will use the `PARTITION` function, grouping by `ticker_id`.

*   `.PARTITION(name=""unique_ticker_entries"", by=(ticker_id))`: After filtering, this partitions the remaining `DailyPrices` records based on their `ticker_id`. This grouping ensures that we can operate on unique `ticker_id`s.
*   `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`: This final step selects the `ticker_id` from each partition.

    *   `HASNOT(historical_prices)` returns `True` if the `historical_prices` sub-collection is empty for a given ticker, and `False` otherwise.
    *   `== 1` is used because `HASNOT` (like `HAS`) returns a boolean-like value (0 or 1) in PyDough, where 1 represents True.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_with_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields:
    *   `cust_state`: This is derived from `customer.state`, accessing the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
    *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, accessing the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `partitioned_transactions = transactions_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transactions_with_details` collection.
    *   `name=""state_ticker_combinations""`: This assigns a name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(cust_state, tick_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the transactions based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

3.  `result = partitioned_transactions.CALCULATE(...).TOP_K(...)`:
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`) created by the `PARTITION` step:
        *   We select the `cust_state` and `tick_type` (which are the partition keys).
        *   We calculate `num_transactions` by counting the number of `Transactions` that fall into that specific group.
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())`: From these aggregated results, we select the top 5 combinations, ordered by `num_transactions` in descending order.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions that occurred within the last 30 days. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current moment (`'now'`).
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `c_country`: The country of the customer who made the transaction, accessed via `customer.country`.
    *   `t_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
    This results in a temporary collection named `transactions_details`.
3.  We then partition the `transactions_details` collection by `c_country`. This groups all transactions by the customer's country.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country (which is `c_country`).
    *   `num_transactions`: The total number of transactions for that country within the last 30 days. This is achieved by `COUNT(transactions_details)`, which counts the records in the `transactions_details` collection that fall into the current country partition.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all transaction amounts for that country within the last 30 days. This is achieved by `SUM(transactions_details.t_amount)`, summing the `t_amount` field from the `transactions_details` records in the current country partition.
5.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 5 countries with the highest `total_transaction_amount`. The results will include the `country_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount` for these top 5 countries.

3.  Further filter these prices to include only those from the last 7 days.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the first quarter of 2023 (January, February, March) and had a status of ""successful"".
2.  For these filtered transactions, create a formatted string representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") to be used for grouping.
3.  Partition the filtered transactions by this year-month string.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction price.
5.  The result will show each month in Q1 2023 (that has successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price.

```python
# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and successful status, and prepare a year-month key

).CALCULATE(
    month = year_month_str,
    avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions that occurred in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitutes the first quarter.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year_month_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(date_time), LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")))`: For each filtered transaction, this creates a new field `year_month_str`.
        *   `YEAR(date_time)` extracts the year.
        *   `MONTH(date_time)` extracts the month number.
        *   `LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")` pads the month number with a leading zero if it's a single digit (e.g., 1 becomes ""01"").
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ...)` combines the year and padded month with a hyphen, creating a string like ""2023-01"".

2.  `monthly_average_prices = q1_2023_successful_transactions.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered and prepared transactions and partitions them.
    *   `name=""monthly_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` field names here, it's part of the syntax).
    *   `by=(year_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of `year_month_str`. This means all transactions for ""2023-01"" will be in one group, ""2023-02"" in another, and so on.

3.  `.CALCULATE(month = year_month_str, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `month = year_month_str`: Selects the `year_month_str` (which represents the month) for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the items in the `monthly_group` partition, which originate from the `Transactions` collection.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result by the month in ascending order (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02"", ""2023-03"").

1.  **`Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000.
2.  **`.payment`**: Accesses the `payment` sub-collection (which are `PaymentsReceived` records) associated with these filtered sales.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each payment, this step calculates two new attributes:
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Determines the start date of the calendar week (e.g., Monday) in which the `payment_date` falls.
    *   `is_weekend_payment_calc = ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, resulting in a boolean value.
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the payments based on their `payment_week_start_date_calc` to include only those from the last 8 full calendar weeks, excluding the current week.
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc >= DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-56 days')`: Ensures the payment week is on or after the start of the week that began 56 days (8 weeks) before the start of the current week.
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc < DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Ensures the payment week is before the start of the current week, effectively excluding the current week.
5.  **`.PARTITION(name=""payments_grouped_by_week"", by=(payment_week_start_date_calc))`**: Groups the filtered payments by their `payment_week_start_date_calc`. Each group will contain all payments made within the same calendar week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_filtered_by_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%'))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `UPPER(vin_number)` converts the `vin_number` field to uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%M5%')` checks if the uppercase `vin_number` contains 'M5' anywhere within it.

2.  `sales_by_model_with_m5_vin = cars_filtered_by_vin.PARTITION(...)`:

1.  `toyota_sales_last_30_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_metrics = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to compute new fields and select existing ones for each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name` and `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them with a prefix `sp_` to avoid potential naming conflicts in subsequent steps.
    *   `sp_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from all their associated sales records (accessed via the `sales_made` sub-collection). If a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.
    *   `sp_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales for each salesperson. If a salesperson has no sales, this count will be 0.

2.  `result = sales_metrics.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This second `CALCULATE` operates on the `sales_metrics` collection (the output of the first `CALCULATE`).
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`, `total_sales_amount=sp_total_sales`, `number_of_sales=sp_num_sales`: These expressions select the previously calculated metrics and rename them to the final desired output field names.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=sp_total_sales.DESC())`: This calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `sp_total_sales` field (calculated in the previous step). `by=sp_total_sales.DESC()` ensures that the rank is based on the total sales amount in descending order (i.e., the salesperson with the highest sales gets rank 1).

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as this represents cars that have been sold.
2.  For each sale, retrieve the car's `make`, `model`, and `sale_price`.
3.  For the car associated with each sale, find its most recent inventory snapshot from the `InventorySnapshots` table. This is done by looking at `Sales.car.inventory_snapshots`, ordering them by `snapshot_date` in descending order, and taking the top one.
4.  Filter these sales to include only those where:
    *   A latest inventory snapshot exists for the car.
    *   The `is_in_inventory` status in this latest snapshot is `False` (meaning the car is no longer in inventory).
5.  Group the filtered sales by `car_make` and `car_model`.
6.  For each group (make and model combination), calculate the maximum `sale_price`.
7.  Finally, order these aggregated results by the `highest_sale_price` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_snapshot_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car_make_calc=Sales.car.make`, `car_model_calc=Sales.car.model`, `sale_price_calc=Sales.sale_price`: These expressions retrieve the make, model, and sale price for the car involved in the current sale. We use `_calc` suffixes to distinguish these calculated fields.
    *   `latest_snapshot_record=Sales.car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1).SINGULAR()`: This is a crucial part. For the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`), it accesses its `inventory_snapshots`. It then filters these snapshots to find the one with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1`. `SINGULAR()` converts the resulting single-item collection into a single record object, representing the latest inventory snapshot. If no snapshots exist or none match the rank, `latest_snapshot_record` might be null or cause an error if not handled, but `HAS` in the next step manages this.

2.  `filtered_sales = sales_with_snapshot_info.WHERE(...)`:
    *   This step filters the records processed in the previous `CALCULATE`.
    *   `(HAS(latest_snapshot_record) == 1)`: This condition ensures that a `latest_snapshot_record` was actually found for the car. If a car has no inventory snapshots, `latest_snapshot_record` would be null, and this condition would filter out such sales.
    *   `(latest_snapshot_record.is_in_inventory == False)`: This condition checks the `is_in_inventory` field of the found `latest_snapshot_record`. It keeps only those sales where the car is confirmed to be no longer in inventory.

3.  `make_model_aggregation = filtered_sales.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""make_model_group"", by=(car_make_calc, car_model_calc))`: The filtered sales records are now grouped (partitioned) by unique combinations of `car_make_calc` and `car_model_calc`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make=car_make_calc, model=car_model_calc, highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales.sale_price_calc))`: For each group (i.e., for each make and model combination):
        *   `make=car_make_calc`, `model=car_model_calc`: The make and model are output.
        *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales.sale_price_calc)`: The maximum `sale_price_calc` among all sales in that group is calculated. This gives the highest sale price for that specific make and model.

4.  `result = make_model_aggregation.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, the aggregated results (one record per make/model with its highest sale price) are sorted in descending order based on the `highest_sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Cars` collection based on the specified conditions.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains 'ford'. The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches, and `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains 'mustang'.
*   `|`: This is the OR operator, combining the two conditions so that cars matching either condition are included.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this function is used to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.
*   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These expressions select the respective car details.
*   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car by averaging the `sale_price` from its associated `sale_records`. If a car has no sale records, the `avg_sale_price` will typically be null.",20.66807222366333,"result = Cars.WHERE(

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  **Define Date Range**: The period of interest is the last six full calendar months prior to the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `six_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month that was six months before the current month.
    *   Sales will be filtered for `sale_date` from `six_months_ago_start_dt` up to (but not including) `current_month_start_dt`.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**: Include salespersons hired in the years 2022 or 2023, inclusive.

3.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales made by these filtered salespersons that fall within the defined date range.

4.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each relevant sale, determine its month (e.g., by truncating `sale_date` to the start of the month). This `sale_month_start_val` will be used for grouping.

5.  **Aggregate Metrics**:
    *   Group the prepared sales data by `sale_month_start_val`.
    *   For each month group:
        *   `PMSPS`: Count the number of sales.
        *   `PMSR`: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales.

6.  **Order Results**: The final results should be ordered by month in ascending order.

7.  **Handling Months with Zero Metrics**: The problem states to ""Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0"". Standard partitioning/grouping in database queries typically only returns groups (months, in this case) that have data. Generating rows for months with no sales activity by the selected salespersons would usually require a calendar table and a left join, or specific functions to generate a series, which are not explicitly detailed in the provided PyDough reference for this kind of scenario. The following query will return all months *that had sales activity* meeting the criteria. Months within the 6-month period with no relevant sales will not appear in the result.

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `current_month_start_dt` and `six_months_ago_start_dt` define the 6-month period for sales analysis (e.g., if it's July, this covers January to June).
2.  `selected_salespersons` filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those hired in 2022 or 2023.
3.  `relevant_sales_from_selected_persons` accesses the `sales_made` for these salespersons and further filters these sales to include only those occurring within the defined 6-month window.
4.  `sales_data_with_month_start` augments each relevant sale record with `sale_month_start_val`, which is the first day of the month in which the sale occurred. This is used for grouping. The original `sale_price` field is carried over.
5.  `monthly_sales_metrics` performs the main aggregation:
    *   It partitions the `sales_data_with_month_start` by `sale_month_start_val`.
    *   For each month group, it calculates:
        *   `month`: The start date of the month (from `sale_month_start_val`).
        *   `PMSPS`: The total count of sales in that month for the selected salespersons, obtained by `COUNT(sales_data_with_month_start)`.
        *   `PMSR`: The total sales revenue in that month, obtained by `SUM(sales_data_with_month_start.sale_price)`.
    *   Finally, it orders the results by `month` in ascending order.

- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want to calculate a single aggregated value.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- This field is computed by taking the `AVG` of `sale_price` from the `Sales` collection.
- The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only records where:
    - The `YEAR(sale_date)` is 2023.
    - The `MONTH(sale_date)` is greater than or equal to 1 (January) AND less than or equal to 3 (March).
- The `AVG` function then calculates the average `sale_price` for these selected sales.",6.597669839859009,"asp_q1_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `Dealership` top-level collection, as GPM is an aggregate calculation over all relevant sales.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` clause, we'll determine:
    *   `calc_total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
    *   `calc_total_cost`: The sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales in 2023. The cost is accessed via `Sales.car.cost`.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` clause, we'll use `calc_total_revenue` and `calc_total_cost` to compute the GPM.
    *   The formula `(calc_total_revenue - calc_total_cost) * 100.0 / calc_total_cost` will be used.
    *   We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.
    *   To prevent division by zero if `calc_total_cost` is 0, we use the `IFF` function, which will return `0.0` in such a case.

```python
result = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue by summing the sale_price of sales made in 2023.
    calc_total_revenue = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting from the `Sales` collection and applies a filter.

    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')))`: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the car.

        *   `DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')`: Compares the `snapshot_date` with the `sale_date` of the sale, ensuring they fall on the same calendar day by truncating both to the start of the day.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_on_out_day = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: This line takes the filtered sales (those that occurred on the day the car went out of inventory) and selects the top 1 sale based on `sale_price` in descending order.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:
1.  **Extract Date Components and Alias Amount**:
    *   From the `PaymentsReceived` collection, the `YEAR` and `MONTH` are extracted from the `payment_date`.
    *   The `payment_amount` is aliased to `amount` for clarity in subsequent steps. This forms the `payments_info` collection.

2.  **Aggregate Payments by Month**:
    *   The `payments_info` collection is partitioned by `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
    *   For each year-month group, `SUM(payments_info.amount)` calculates the `total_monthly_payment`. The results are stored with new field names `year_val` and `month_val` to represent the year and month of the aggregation. This forms `monthly_aggregated_payments`.

3.  **Order Monthly Aggregates**:
    *   The `monthly_aggregated_payments` are ordered by `year_val` (ascending) and `month_val` (ascending). This chronological sorting is essential for the correct functioning of the `PREV` window function used in the next step.

4.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    *   A final `CALCULATE` operation is performed on the ordered monthly payments.
    *   The fields are renamed to `year`, `month`, and `total_payments_received` for the final output.
    *   The `mom_change` is calculated as `total_monthly_payment - PREV(total_monthly_payment, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()), default=0.0)`.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_payment, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()), default=0.0)` fetches the `total_monthly_payment` from the previous month in the ordered sequence.
        *   The `by` clause ensures `PREV` operates over the correctly sorted data.
        *   `default=0.0` handles the case for the very first month in the dataset, where there is no preceding month; its MoM change will be calculated against 0.

**Note on ""months with no payments""**: This query will include months that have records in `PaymentsReceived` which might sum up to zero. However, if a calendar month has absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` table, it will not appear in the result, as PyDough operations are based on existing data.

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because the query asks for a single aggregated value (Total Sales Count).
- `Dealership.Sales` accesses all sales records.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
    - `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    - `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0)` ensures that we only consider sales that happened on or before today (not in the future).
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` ensures that the sales happened within the last 6 days from today (e.g., if today is the 7th, this includes sales from the 1st to the 7th).
    - Combining these with `&` gives us sales from the 7-day period ending today.
- `COUNT(...)` then counts the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  Filter out salespersons who have not made any sales, as ASP cannot be calculated for them (it would involve division by zero). We use `WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)` for this.
3.  For the remaining salespersons, calculate their ASP. ASP is defined as `total sales amount / number of sales`.
    *   `total sales amount` is `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`.
    *   `number of sales` is `COUNT(sales_made)`.
    *   We will also select `first_name` and `last_name` and assign them to temporary calculation variables.
4.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())` to select the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated ASP in descending order.
5.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` to present the `first_name`, `last_name`, and the calculated ASP (renamed to `ASP`) as requested.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. `HAS(sales_made) == 1` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (list of sales for that salesperson) is not empty. This is crucial to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(calc_first_name=first_name, calc_last_name=last_name, calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))`: For each salesperson who has made sales:
    *   `calc_first_name=first_name` and `calc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's first and last names, storing them in temporary variables `calc_first_name` and `calc_last_name`.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP).
        *   `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` sums the `sale_price` of all sales made by the salesperson.
        *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
        *   The result is stored in the `calculated_asp` field.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This takes the collection of salespersons (now with their ASP calculated) and selects the top 3 based on the `calculated_asp` field in descending order.
4.  `.CALCULATE(first_name=calc_first_name, last_name=calc_last_name, ASP=calculated_asp)`: This final step takes the top 3 salespersons and formats the output:
    *   `first_name=calc_first_name`: Selects the first name.
    *   `last_name=calc_last_name`: Selects the last name.

1.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate their total sales amount. This is done by summing the `sale_price` from their associated sales records (found in the `sales_made` sub-collection). We'll also select their ID, first name, and last name, storing them temporarily.
3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the 5 salespersons with the highest `total_sales_amount`. The sorting will be in descending order, and any NULL values for total sales will be placed last, as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `temp_id = _id`: The salesperson's ID.
    *   `temp_first_name = first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
    *   `temp_last_name = last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
    *   `temp_total_sales = SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: The total sales amount for the salesperson. `sales_made` is a sub-collection of sales records linked to the salesperson, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `SUM()` aggregates these prices.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Sorts the salespersons by `temp_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that if any salesperson has a NULL total sales amount, they are placed at the end of the sorted list (and thus are unlikely to be in the top 5).

The goal is to return a distinct list of salesperson IDs who have processed at least one sale that was paid for in cash.
To achieve this, we will:
1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, check their `sales_made`.
3.  For each sale made, check its `payment` (list of `PaymentsReceived`).
4.  Filter these payments to find any where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
5.  If a salesperson has at least one such sale with a cash payment, we include their `_id` (as `salesperson_id`) in the result.
6.  Selecting `_id` from the filtered `Salespersons` collection inherently provides a distinct list.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
cash_payment_salespersons = Salespersons.WHERE(
    HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`: This is the core filtering logic.
    *   `sales_made`: This accesses the list of sales associated with each salesperson.
    *   `.payment`: For each sale in `sales_made`, this accesses the list of payments received for that sale.
    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`: This filters the payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one record resulting from the nested path (`sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`). If a salesperson has at least one sale paid in cash, this condition will be true.

Each group is named ""method_groups"" internally, and the partitioning key `payment_method` is available for subsequent calculations.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` (which is the partitioning key).
    *   `total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts the number of payment records within each `payment_method` group. `PaymentsReceived` here refers to the sub-collection of payments belonging to the current group.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments within the current `payment_method` group.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_amount.DESC())`: This takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of payment methods with their total payments and total amounts) and selects the top 3 entries.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",46.41080641746521,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

We filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 3 months (from `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` up to `DATETIME('now')`). Then, we sum the `sale_price` of these filtered sales to get the total revenue for that period.

2.  Filter these payments to include only those where the `vendor_name` is 'Utility Company'.
3.  Further filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). We can achieve this using the `DAYNAME` function to get the name of the day and then check if it is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using the `ISIN` function.
4.  Count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.
5.  The final result will be a single count, so we'll use the `Dealership` high-level collection and `CALCULATE` to present this count.

        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `Dealership` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
*   `num_weekend_payments = COUNT(...)`: We define a field `num_weekend_payments` that will hold the count of the filtered payments.
*   `PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`: We access the `PaymentsMade` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
*   `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This is the first condition, filtering payments made to 'Utility Company'.
*   `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two filter conditions.
*   `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This is the second condition.

1.  **Calculate Date Boundaries**: Determine the start and end dates of the ""previous ISO week"". An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday. The ""previous ISO week"" is the full week immediately preceding the current week. We'll use `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` to find the start of the current week, and then adjust by `-7 days` for the start of the previous week and `-1 day` for the end of the previous week. This assumes that the `start of week` configuration in PyDough aligns with Monday, as per ISO 8601 standards.
2.  **Filter Payments**: Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated boundaries of the previous ISO week.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For the filtered payments, we'll create fields to be used as keys for partitioning:
    *   A `payment_day_key` by truncating the `payment_date` to its day component (e.g., using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`).
    *   A `payment_method_key` directly from the `payment_method` field.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: Partition the prepared payment records by `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`. For each resulting group (i.e., for each unique day and payment method combination within the previous week), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.
5.  **Format Output**: The final result will show the specific day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries_calc`: This initial `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` collection determines the `previous_iso_week_start_date` (Monday of the previous week) and `previous_iso_week_end_date` (Sunday of the previous week). This relies on `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` correctly identifying the start of the current week, and assumes it aligns with ISO standards (Monday start).
2.  `payments_in_previous_week_prepared`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated `previous_iso_week_start_date` and `previous_iso_week_end_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` prepares two new fields:
        *   `payment_day_key`: This truncates the `payment_date` to the start of its day, allowing us to group payments by the specific calendar day.
        *   `payment_method_key`: This is simply the `payment_method` and will be used for grouping.
3.  `daily_payments_by_method`: This is the core of the aggregation.
    *   We `PARTITION` the `payments_in_previous_week_prepared` collection. The `by` clause uses `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`, effectively creating groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on these partitions:
        *   `payment_date`: Takes the value of `payment_day_key` for the output.
        *   `payment_method`: Takes the value of `payment_method_key` for the output.
        *   `total_daily_amount`: Calculates the `SUM` of `payment_amount` from the original `PaymentsReceived` collection, but summed only for the records belonging to the current partition (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
4.  `result`: The variable `result` holds the final dataset, where each row represents a unique day and payment method from the previous ISO week, along with the total payment amount received for that combination.",59.17782139778137,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_transformed`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` clause, we derive:
        *   `customer_st`: The state of the customer associated with the sale, accessed via `customer.state`.
        *   `_month_of_sale`: An intermediate field for the month of the sale.
        *   `_first_month_in_quarter_num`: An intermediate field that determines the first month number (1, 4, 7, or 10) of the quarter based on `_month_of_sale`.
        *   `quarter_start_dt_str`: The final string representation of the quarter's start date (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This is constructed using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for correct formatting.

2.  `quarterly_sales_report`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_transformed` data. The partitioning keys are `customer_st` and `quarter_start_dt_str`. This groups sales by unique combinations of customer state and quarter start date.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause on the partitioned data then:
        *   Selects the partitioning keys `customer_st` (as `state_val`) and `quarter_start_dt_str` (as `quarter_val`).
        *   Calculates `total_sales_for_quarter` by summing `Sales.sale_price` for all sales records belonging to each group.

3.  `result`:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` statement is used to select and rename the fields to `customer_state`, `quarter`, and `total_sales` as requested by the problem description.

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by operating on the top-level `Dealership` collection to determine a global value: the latest snapshot date in March 2023.
    *   `MAX(InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).snapshot_date)`: This part filters all `InventorySnapshots` to include only those where the `snapshot_date` falls in March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) of the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). From these filtered snapshots, it selects the maximum `snapshot_date`.
    *   This maximum date is then assigned to a new field `latest_date_in_march_2023`. `latest_snapshot_info` becomes a collection with a single row containing this calculated date.

2.  `result = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).car.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection within the context of `latest_snapshot_info`. This makes the `latest_date_in_march_2023` field available for filtering.
    *   `.WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: This filters the `InventorySnapshots` to keep only those records where:

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection. For each drug, we will calculate its name and its average Defined Daily Dose (DDD).

2.  **`drug_name = drug_name`**: This selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection to be included in the output.

3.  **`average_ddd_value = AVG(...)`**: This calculates the average DDD for each drug. The `AVG` function aggregates DDD values calculated from the drug's associated treatments.

4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: This accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.

5.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total days of treatment is a positive value. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the duration of the treatment in full days. This condition prevents division by zero (if duration is 0) or illogical negative DDDs (if duration is negative).

6.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_ddd = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD:
    *   `tot_drug_amt`: Represents the ""total drug amount consumed during one treatment"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: Represents the ""total days of treatment"".
    *   The result is named `treatment_ddd`.

7.  **`.treatment_ddd`**: After calculating `treatment_ddd` for all valid treatments of a drug, this expression provides these individual DDD values to the `AVG` function.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name` and its corresponding `average_ddd_value`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date References Calculation (`date_references`):**
    *   The query first calculates the year and month for three specific time periods: the last full month (M-1), the month before last (M-2), and two months before last (M-3). This is done relative to the current date using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` as a base and subtracting 1, 2, or 3 months.
    *   These date components (`m1_year_val`, `m1_month_val`, etc.) are calculated at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level, making them available as context for subsequent operations on the `Treatments` collection.

2.  **Filtering and Augmenting Treatments (`treatments_in_target_months`):**
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection via `date_references.Treatments`.
    *   For each treatment, it extracts the `treatment_yr` (year of `start_dt`) and `treatment_mth` (month of `start_dt`).
    *   It stores the `patient_id` as `patient_identifier` for later distinct counting.
    *   It adds a boolean flag `is_biologic_drug_treatment` which is true if the treatment's associated drug has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these augmented treatments, keeping only those whose `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth` match one of the three target months calculated in `date_references`.

3.  **Partitioning and Aggregation (`monthly_patient_summary`):**
    *   The `treatments_in_target_months` collection is then partitioned by `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth`. This groups all treatments by the month they occurred in.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each of the target months that has treatment data):
        *   `month_label`: A display string for the month is created in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-10"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `distinct_patient_count`: `NDISTINCT` is used on `treatments_in_target_months.patient_identifier` to count the unique number of patients who received any treatment in that specific month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count`: `NDISTINCT` is used on `treatments_in_target_months.WHERE(is_biologic_drug_treatment == True).patient_identifier`. This first filters the treatments within the month to include only biologic drug treatments, and then counts the unique number of patients who received such treatments.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_label` in descending order, so the most recent of the three months appears first.

4.  **Final Result (`result`):**
    *   The `monthly_patient_summary` variable holds the final result, which will contain rows for each of the last three months (that had treatment data), with columns: `month_label`, `distinct_patient_count`, and `biologic_treatment_patient_count`.",79.68649792671204,"# Step 1: Calculate the year and month for the three target months (last month, month before last, two months before last)

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_val = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-6 months')`: This line defines the beginning of our 6-month window.

2.  `end_date_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines the end of our window (exclusive). It's the start of the current month (e.g., July 1st). Treatments must have a `start_dt` *before* this date.
3.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We use the top-level collection `DermTreatment` to perform a global calculation, resulting in a single output row.
4.  `num_treatments_for_alice = COUNT(...)`: This calculates the desired count and assigns it to the field `num_treatments_for_alice`.
5.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".

2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We then partition these doctors based on their `speciality`. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  **Rank within Specialty**: Within each specialty group (partition), we rank the doctors. The ranking (`SDRSDR`) is based on the `num_distinct_drugs` (calculated in step 1) in descending order, so doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a better (lower number) rank. The `per` clause of the `RANKING` function will refer to the named partition to ensure ranking is done independently for each specialty.
4.  **Select Final Fields**: Finally, we select the required fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, `num_distinct_drugs`, and the calculated `SDRSDR`.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor,
# along with their ID and specialty.
doc_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(
    doc_id=doc_id,
    speciality_field=speciality,  # Use an intermediate name for the specialty field
    num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)
)

# Step 2: Partition the doctors by their specialty.
# The 'Doctors' collection items (now represented by 'doc_info') are grouped by 'speciality_field'.
# The name ""specialty_partition"" will be used to refer to these groups in the ranking step.
# Then, we access the 'Doctors' items within each partition to perform calculations on individual doctors.
result = doc_info.PARTITION(
    name=""specialty_partition"",
    by=(speciality_field)
).Doctors.CALCULATE(
    doc_id=doc_id,  # Original doc_id from Doctors
    speciality=speciality_field,  # The specialty by which it was partitioned
    num_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs,  # The count calculated in doc_info
    SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_partition"")  # Rank within the specialty_partition
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `doc_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   It calculates three fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `speciality_field`: The doctor's specialty. We use an intermediate name `speciality_field` to make it distinct for partitioning.
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`. It counts the number of unique drug IDs found across all treatments prescribed by the doctor.

2.  `result = doc_info.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `doc_info` collection (which contains doctors with their distinct drug counts).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_partition"", by=(speciality_field))`: It partitions the doctors into groups based on their `speciality_field`. Each group is named `specialty_partition`.

3.  `.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   After partitioning, `.Doctors` accesses the individual doctor records within each `specialty_partition`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then computes the final set of fields for each doctor within their specialty group:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `speciality`: The doctor's specialty (taken from the `speciality_field` partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: The previously calculated count of distinct drugs.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_partition"")`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (more drugs = better rank, i.e., rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_partition""`: This crucial part ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group (partition). Doctors are only ranked against other doctors in the same specialty.

The final `result` variable will contain a collection where each record represents a doctor with their ID, specialty, the number of distinct drugs they prescribed, and their rank within that specialty based on this count.",75.09993290901184,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor,

The `start_dt` of treatments is used to determine the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   A new field, `calc_treatment_year_month`, is calculated by combining the year and month from `start_dt` into a 'YYYY-MM' string format (e.g., ""2023-03""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits. This field will be used for grouping.
    *   The `start_dt` is aliased to `calc_treatment_start_dt` to be used in the filtering condition.

2.  **Filter for the Relevant Time Period**:
    *   The treatments are filtered to include only those within the last 12 full months, prior to the current month.
    *   The start of this period is `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-12 months')` (e.g., if today is 2024-07-15, this is 2023-07-01).
    *   The end of this period is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (e.g., 2024-07-01), making the range exclusive of the current month.
    *   The condition is `(calc_treatment_start_dt >= start_of_period) & (calc_treatment_start_dt < end_of_period)`.

3.  **Group by Month and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered treatments are then partitioned (grouped) by `calc_treatment_year_month` using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_data_group"", by=(calc_treatment_year_month))`.
    *   Within each monthly group, the following metrics are calculated:
        *   `output_month`: This is the `calc_treatment_year_month` for the group.
        *   `PMPD_metric`: Calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received a treatment (and thus an associated diagnosis) that started in that month.
        *   `PMTC_metric`: Calculated as `COUNT(Treatments)`. This counts the total number of treatments that started in that month.
    *   The results are ordered by `output_month` in ascending order.

4.  **Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `month`, `PMPD`, and `PMTC` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcome_scores`: This line defines a filtered subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It includes only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check is performed using `DEFAULT_TO(field, -999) != -999`, which effectively filters out nulls if -999 is a value that actual PASI scores would not take.
2.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the highest level of the database graph.
    *   `avg_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
3.  The subsequent `.CALCULATE(...)` takes these two average values:
    *   `calculated_d7d100pir = (avg_day100_pasi - avg_day7_pasi) / avg_day7_pasi * 100`: Applies the D7D100PIR formula as defined in the problem description.
4.  The final `.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR = calculated_d7d100pir)` selects this computed D7D100PIR value and names the resulting column `D7D100PIR`. This will produce a table with a single row and a single column containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.",86.84793663024902,"# Step 1: Filter outcome records to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want to calculate a single aggregated value (the count of specific patients).
2.  **`pic_female_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `pic_female_patients` which will hold the result of our count.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Female"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`**:
    *   We access the `Patients` collection.
    *   We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these patients based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `gender == ""Female""`: Selects only patients whose `gender` is ""Female"".
        *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Selects only patients whose `ins_type` is ""Private"", based on the definition of PIC (private insured patient count).
4.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function then counts the number of patients who satisfy both conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

1.  Iterate through each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, calculate a new field `num_adverse_events_same_month`. This calculation involves:
    a.  Accessing all treatments associated with the current drug via the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
    b.  For each of these treatments, accessing its associated adverse events via the `adverse_events` sub-collection.
    c.  Filtering these adverse events. An adverse event is kept if the year of its `reported_dt` matches the year of its parent treatment's `start_dt`, AND the month of its `reported_dt` matches the month of its parent treatment's `start_dt`. The path `treatment.start_dt` is used within the context of an adverse event to refer to the start date of the treatment to which the adverse event is linked.
    d.  Counting all such filtered adverse events. This sum represents the total number of adverse events for the current drug that occurred in the same month and year as their respective treatment start dates.
3.  Once this count is determined for every drug, use the `TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events_same_month.DESC())` function to identify the drug with the maximum count. If there's a tie, one of the top drugs will be selected.
4.  Finally, select the `drug_id` (as ""drug's _id""), `drug_name`, and the calculated `num_adverse_events_same_month` (renamed to `num_adverse_events`) for the identified drug.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have at least one prescribed treatment (`prescribed_treatments`) where the associated drug (`drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'. The `HAS` function is used to check for the existence of such treatments.
3.  Group the filtered doctors by their location state (`loc_state`) using the `PARTITION` method. This ensures that we process each state only once.
4.  Use the `CALCULATE` method to output the distinct state names.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first filters the `Doctors` collection. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HAS` function to check if a doctor has any `prescribed_treatments` that satisfy the condition `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`. This condition navigates from a treatment to its associated drug and checks the drug's type.

Once the relevant doctors are identified, the `PARTITION` method is used. It groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. The `name=""unique_doctor_states""` argument names these groups.

Finally, `CALCULATE(state_name=loc_state)` is applied to the result of the partition. Since `PARTITION` creates groups based on unique `loc_state` values, this `CALCULATE` effectively produces a list of distinct states, renaming `loc_state` to `state_name` in the output.",26.48040890693665,"# Filter doctors to find those who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Partition the patients by their `ins_type`. This creates groups for each insurance type.
3.  For each insurance type group:
    a.  Calculate `avg_pasi_score_d100`:
        *   Access the `treatments_received` by patients within the current insurance type group.
        *   Filter these treatments to include only those where `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`.
        *   From these filtered treatments, access their `outcome_records`.
        *   Take the `day100_pasi_score` from these outcome records.
        *   Calculate the average (`AVG`) of these `day100_pasi_score` values. `AVG` will typically ignore NULL scores.
    b.  Calculate `num_distinct_patients`:
        *   Count the number of patients within the current insurance type group who have at least one treatment (`HAS(treatments_received...`) that ended in the year 2022 (`YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`).
4.  Filter these calculated statistics to include only insurance types where `avg_pasi_score_d100` is not NULL, ensuring that we are considering types with actual score data.
5.  Select the `TOP_K` 5 results, ordering them by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (`ASC`).

    *   `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records)`: This function checks if there is at least one outcome record across all treatments for a given patient. It returns `True` (or 1) if outcome assessments exist, and `False` (or 0) otherwise.
    *   `== 1`: This ensures we only keep patients for whom `HAS(...)` is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id = patient_id, first_name = first_name, last_name = last_name)`**: This step selects the specified fields for the patients who met the filter criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection, which contains all drug records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_used_in) == 1)`**: This filters the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection of `Drugs` that lists all treatments in which a particular drug has been used.
    *   `HASNOT(treatments_used_in)` checks if this sub-collection is empty for each drug. It returns `True` (or `1` in PyDough's boolean context) if the drug has not been used in any treatments.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(drug_id=drug_id, drug_name=drug_name)`**: This selects the `drug_id` and `drug_name` fields for the drugs that satisfy the `WHERE` condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Patients` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these patients.
    *   `HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1` checks if the `treatments_received` sub-collection for each patient is empty. `treatments_received` is a list of treatments associated with a patient. If this list is empty, `HASNOT` returns true (1), indicating the patient has not received any treatments.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**:
    *   After filtering, the `CALCULATE` function is used to select and rename the desired fields for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Diagnoses.WHERE(HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas) == 1)`**:

    *   Filters these diagnoses to include only those for which there is at least one associated treatment (`treatments_for`) that has at least one outcome record (`outcome_records`) with a non-null `day100_itch_vas` score. This ensures we only consider diagnoses with relevant data for the itch score.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each filtered diagnosis, this step calculates three new fields:
        *   `diagnosis_name_val=diag_name`: Retrieves the name of the diagnosis.
        *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with all treatments for the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function will consider all non-null scores.
        *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.WHERE(HAS(outcome_records.day100_itch_vas) == 1).patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the current diagnosis. It specifically counts patients whose treatments (`treatments_for`) have at least one outcome record with a non-null `day100_itch_vas` score. This ensures the patient count is relevant to the itch score being analyzed.

For example, if the current date is in July, this period would span from February 1st to August 1st (exclusive), covering all treatments started in February, March, April, May, June, and July.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this calculated 6-month period.
3.  **Extract Specialty**: For these filtered treatments, we access the `speciality` of the prescribing `doctor`.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**: We then partition these treatments by the doctor's specialty (`doc_spec`). For each specialty, we calculate:
    *   `count_treatments`: The total number of treatments prescribed by doctors of that specialty within the period.
    *   `sum_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all such treatments.
5.  **Rank Specialties**: We rank these specialties in descending order based on the `sum_drug_amount` and select the top 3.

    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. This will be checked case-insensitively using `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with wildcards (`%psoriasis%`).
    *   **Drug Condition**: The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We'll infer this by checking if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field in the `Drugs` collection (accessed via `Treatments.drug`) exists and is not null using `HAS()`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The treatment must have an `end_dt` that falls within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). We also ensure `end_dt` exists using `HAS()`.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the top `DermTreatment` level.

```python
# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &  # Drug is FDA-approved (approval date exists)
    (HAS(end_dt) == 1) &  # Treatment has an end date
    (end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) &  # Treatment ended on or after 6 months ago
    (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))  # Treatment ended on or before today
)

# Calculate the total number of such treatments
count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions within the `WHERE` clause must be true for a treatment to be included.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition checks the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with each treatment. `LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name)` converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')` then checks if this lowercase name contains ""psoriasis"" anywhere within it (due to the `%` wildcards).
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition verifies that the `drug` used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function returns true if the field exists and is not null, which we interpret as the drug being FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded before attempting date comparisons.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current moment. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` is on or before the current moment, meaning it has indeed ended.

2.  `count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`: This calculates the total number of treatments present in the `filtered_treatments` collection and assigns this count to a new field named `num_treatments`. The result will be a collection with a single row and a single column containing the desired count.",33.75721096992493,"# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date

2.  Filter the `Doctors` collection to include only those doctors whose `year_reg` matches this target year.
3.  For each of these doctors, identify their first prescribed treatment. This is done by:
    *   Accessing their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection.
    *   Ranking these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The ranking is performed per doctor.
    *   Selecting the treatment with rank 1. We use `allow_ties=False` to ensure a single ""first"" treatment is chosen if multiple treatments share the earliest start date.
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to ensure we are referencing a single treatment record.
4.  In the final `CALCULATE` step, we select the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`, and from their first treatment, the `start_dt` and `treatment_id`. If a doctor has no treatments, the treatment-related fields will be null.

The treatment identifier requested as ""_id"" in the prompt will be taken as `treatment_id` from the `Treatments` collection, as this is the primary identifier for a treatment record.

**Explanation:**

1.  `first_treatment_details_expr`: This contextless expression defines how to find the first treatment for any given doctor.
    *   `Doctors.prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1)`: Filters these treatments to find the one(s) that rank first when ordered by `start_dt` (ascending). `per=""Doctors""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each doctor's treatments. `allow_ties=False` ensures that if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, only one is ranked as 1 (the choice among ties is database-dependent but consistent).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record due to `RANKING ... == 1` and `allow_ties=False`) into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields. If no treatments exist, or if the filter yields no results, this will be a null record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`conmed_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment`**: This contextless expression defines the condition for a concomitant medication to be considered as starting ""within 2 weeks"" of the main treatment. It calculates the absolute difference in days between the treatment's start date (`Treatments.start_dt`) and the concomitant medication's start date (`start_dt` within the `concomitant_meds` context).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, which is suitable for computing a single aggregate value.
2.  **`AVG(...)`**: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""male"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`**:
    *   This part accesses the `Patients` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these patients to include only those where:
        *   `gender` is equal to `""male""`.
        *   `ins_type` is equal to `""private""`.
        *   Both conditions must be true due to the `&` (AND) operator.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`**:
    *   This `CALCULATE` operates on the filtered set of patients.
    *   It computes a new field named `age_in_years` for each patient.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`), effectively giving their current age in integer years.
5.  **`.age_in_years`**: This accesses the `age_in_years` field (computed in the previous step) from the collection of filtered and age-calculated patients. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these ages.
6.  **`average_age = ...`**: The final result of the average calculation is assigned to a field named `average_age` within the output of `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to compute intermediate values for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name and assigns it to `merchant_name`.
    *   `distinct_coupons_count=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of unique coupons used in successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""SUCCESSFUL"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""SUCCESSFUL"" and have an associated coupon (checked using `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
        *   `.coupon.cid`: Accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the coupon associated with each of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `distinct_transactions_count=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of unique successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""SUCCESSFUL"")`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""SUCCESSFUL"".
        *   `.txid`: Accesses the `txid` (transaction ID) of these transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique transaction IDs.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one and computes the final CPUR.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: This ensures `merchant_name` is included in the final output.
    *   `cpur=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(distinct_transactions_count > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This is a conditional expression. If `distinct_transactions_count` is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division. Otherwise (if it's 0, to prevent division by zero), CPUR is set to `0.0`.
        *   `distinct_coupons_count / distinct_transactions_count`: This is the CPUR formula.

The final output `result` will contain a list of records, each with `merchant_name` and its corresponding `cpur`.",60.2917115688324,"result = Merchants.CALCULATE(

1.  **Define Target Weeks**: First, we calculate the start dates of the three weeks preceding the current week. These will be used to filter notifications. We use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to make these dates available for subsequent operations.
2.  **Filter Users**: We select users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Access Notifications**: For these selected users, we access their `notifications`.
4.  **Enhance Notification Data**: For each notification, we calculate two new pieces of information:
    *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start of the week in which the notification was created. This is done by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_on_weekend`: A boolean flag indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME(created_at)`.
5.  **Filter Notifications by Target Weeks**: We then filter these processed notifications to include only those whose `notification_actual_week_start` falls into one of the three target weeks defined in step 1.
6.  **Group by Week**: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by their `notification_actual_week_start`. This creates a group for each relevant week.
7.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each weekly group, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for that group.
    *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications in that group (i.e., for that week).
    *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications within that group that were sent on a weekend. This is achieved by summing up a conditional value (1 if `is_on_weekend` is true, 0 otherwise).

This approach ensures that we count notifications only for the specified users, correctly identify the relevant weeks, and aggregate the total and weekend notification counts for each of those weeks.

*   `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Users` collection and calculate new fields for each user.
*   `user_id=uid`: We select the user's ID and name it `user_id`.
*   `opt_in_status=...`: This part retrieves the marketing opt-in status.
    *   `setting_snapshots`: Accesses the list of setting snapshots for the current user.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`: This filters the snapshots.
        *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: Ranks the snapshots for each user (`per=""Users""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest date gets rank 1).
        *   `== 1`: Selects only the snapshot with rank 1, which is the latest one for that user.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the `WHERE` clause ensures only one snapshot is selected per user, `SINGULAR()` allows us to treat it as a single record rather than a collection.
    *   `.marketing_opt_in`: Accesses the `marketing_opt_in` field from that single, latest snapshot.

This involves summing the amounts from successfully received transactions where the receiver type indicates a merchant, and then ranking merchants based on these total amounts.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Start with the `Merchants` collection**: This is because we need to output information and rankings for each merchant.
2.  **Calculate Revenue for Each Merchant**:
    *   For each merchant, we access their `transactions_received`. These are transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only ""successful"" ones. The problem implies ""successfully received transactions"", so we'll filter by `status == ""completed""` (a common status for successful transactions).
    *   Additionally, we filter by `receiver_type == 1` as specified in the problem description for transactions pertaining to merchants.
    *   The `amount` of these filtered transactions is summed up to get `calculated_revenue` for each merchant. If a merchant has no such transactions, this sum might be NULL or 0. We assume `SUM` over an empty set results in NULL.
    *   We also select the merchant's `name` and `category` for the final output, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` temporarily to avoid potential naming conflicts.
3.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Fields**:
    *   The previously calculated `m_name`, `m_category`, and `calculated_revenue` are carried forward.
    *   The `RANKING` function is used to determine `revenue_rank`.
        *   It ranks merchants based on `calculated_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the highest revenue gets rank 1.
        *   `na_pos='last'` is used within `DESC()` to ensure that merchants with NULL revenue (i.e., no qualifying transactions) are ranked last, contributing to deterministic output.
        *   `allow_ties=True` ensures that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects the required fields with the specified names: `merchant_name`, `category`, `revenue_amount`, and `revenue_rank`.

Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",Ewallet,"The query aims to calculate the Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) for wallet transactions over the last two full months, excluding the current month. Based on the provided definition, PMDAU is taken to mean the count of distinct senders (where `sender_type = 0`) who made transactions within each respective month. The `created_at` timestamp is truncated to the start of the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates the date boundaries for the period of interest.
    *   `current_month_boundary`: The start of the current month. Transactions on or after this date are excluded.
    *   `start_period_boundary`: The start of the month that was two months before the current month. Transactions on or after this date (and before `current_month_boundary`) are included.
    *   For example, if today is July 15th, 2023, `current_month_boundary` would be 2023-07-01, and `start_period_boundary` would be 2023-05-01. The query would consider transactions from May 1st, 2023, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2023 (i.e., transactions in May and June).

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   It accesses the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0`.
    *   Filters transactions to fall within the calculated date range (`>= start_period_boundary` and `< current_month_boundary`).
    *   For each of these filtered transactions, it calculates `transaction_month_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the first day of its month. This field will be used for grouping.

3.  **Calculate PMDAU per Month**:
    *   The prepared transaction data is then partitioned by `transaction_month_start`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `year_val`: The year of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `month_val`: The month number of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `pmdau`: The number of distinct `sender_id` values within that month's transactions. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by year and then by month for a clear, chronological presentation.

This approach directly implements the definition ""PMDAU = distinct sender with sender\_type = 0"" and ""Truncate created\_at to month for aggregation"", interpreting PMDAU as the count of unique active users per month for the specified period.

2.  `.CALCULATE(duration_secs = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, this calculates the duration in seconds by subtracting `session_start_ts` from `session_end_ts` using `DATEDIFF`.

    *   The sum of the `amount` from all transactions associated with that coupon. This is done by accessing the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which links to `Transactions`) and summing their `amount` field.
5.  The final result will contain the coupon ID and the total transacted amount for that coupon.

```python
# Filter for the merchant with mid = 1 and access its coupons
merchant_coupons = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons

# Calculate the total transaction amount for each coupon
# SUM(transaction_used_in.amount) will sum the 'amount' from the 'Transactions'

This PyDough code snippet first filters the `Merchants` collection to find the merchant with `mid` equal to 1. Then, it accesses the `coupons` associated with this merchant.

1.  Define the time window: from exactly one month ago relative to the current moment, up to the current moment.
2.  Access the `UserSessions` collection.
3.  Filter the sessions where `session_start_ts` falls within this time window.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we are calculating an aggregate value (total count) across a subset of `UserSessions`.
2.  `tuc_count = COUNT(...)`: This defines a new field `tuc_count` which will hold the total number of user sessions.
3.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `UserSessions` collection and apply a filter.
4.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This function call generates a timestamp representing exactly one month prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function call generates the current timestamp.
    *   The condition filters sessions whose `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to one month ago and less than or equal to the current moment, effectively covering the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"".
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `UserSessions` records that satisfy the `WHERE` clause condition.

The final result `total_user_sessions_past_month` will be a collection with a single row and a single column `tuc_count` containing the total number of user sessions in the specified period.",20.052520036697388,"total_user_sessions_past_month = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

1.  **Identify the Previous Month**: We'll use date functions to determine the year and month corresponding to the month immediately preceding the current one.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Select transactions that occurred within this identified previous month.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those of `transaction_type == ""wallet""`.
3.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of these filtered wallet transactions from the previous month.
    *   Count how many of_ these transactions had a `status == ""successful""` (assuming ""successful"" is the status string for successful transactions).
4.  **Calculate STR**: Apply the given formula: `STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions`. We'll express this as a percentage and handle cases where the total number of transactions is zero to avoid division errors.
5.  **Return the Result**: The final output should be the calculated STR value.

**Explanation:**

2.  `target_year_for_calc = YEAR(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)` and `target_month_for_calc = MONTH(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)`: These lines extract the year and month from the date calculated in the previous step. These will be used to filter transactions.

    *   `YEAR(created_at) == target_year_for_calc) & (MONTH(created_at) == target_month_for_calc)`: Ensures transactions are from the identified previous month.
    *   `transaction_type == ""wallet""`: Filters for wallet transactions. We assume ""wallet"" is the string used in the `transaction_type` field.
4.  `str_calculation_result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` (top graph) level, as we need a single aggregate result.
    *   `num_successful_wallet_tx = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions_filtered.WHERE(status == ""successful""))`: Counts the number of successful wallet transactions from the filtered set. We assume ""successful"" is the string in the `status` field indicating success.
    *   `num_total_wallet_tx = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions_filtered)`: Counts the total number of wallet transactions from the filtered set.
    *   `calculated_previous_month_str = IFF(...)`: Calculates the STR.
        *   `IFF(num_total_wallet_tx > 0, ... , 0.0)`: This checks if there were any wallet transactions. If `num_total_wallet_tx` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `(num_successful_wallet_tx * 100.0) / num_total_wallet_tx` (to get a percentage).
        *   If `num_total_wallet_tx` is 0, STR is set to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_creation_date_parts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   It calculates `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` from the merchant's `created_at` timestamp.
    *   It also renames `mid` to `merchant_identifier` and `name` to `merchant_display_name` to carry these values forward and avoid naming conflicts.

2.  `merchants_with_coupon_count = merchants_with_creation_date_parts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the output from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`.

    *   A `WHERE` clause filters these coupons: `(YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month)`. This ensures that only coupons created in the same year and month as the merchant are considered. Note that `created_at` inside `coupons.WHERE(...)` refers to the coupon's creation date, while `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` refer to the merchant's creation date parts calculated in the previous step.
    *   `COUNT` then counts these filtered coupons.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Users` collection.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This will be the first day of the month of the transaction, derived using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will serve as our grouping key for months.
    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `month_as_date_obj`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (our partition key), representing the month.
    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.
5.  Finally, we order the results by `month_as_date_obj` in ascending order to get the counts from the earliest month first.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`**: This selects the desired information for the filtered merchants.

Return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications.,SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM notifications WHERE type = 'transaction';,Ewallet,"To return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications, we will perform the following steps:
1.  Access the `Notifications` collection.
2.  Filter the notifications to select only those that are 'transaction' notifications. We'll assume the `notification_type` field will have a value like 'TRANSACTION' for this purpose.
3.  Group the filtered notifications by `user_id` using `PARTITION` to ensure distinctness.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION')`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection and filters it to include only records where the `notification_type` field is equal to 'TRANSACTION'. This step isolates notifications that are specifically related to transactions. (Note: 'TRANSACTION' is assumed to be the value representing transaction-related notifications).
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""users_partition"", by=(user_id))`: After filtering, this applies a `PARTITION` operation. It groups the remaining notification records by the `user_id` field. The `name=""users_partition""` assigns a temporary name to these groups, and `by=(user_id)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on unique user IDs.
3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id)`: Finally, this `CALCULATE` clause is applied to the result of the `PARTITION`. For each partition (i.e., for each unique `user_id` that has a 'TRANSACTION' type notification), it selects the `user_id`.

1.  **Identify Relevant Merchants and Their Latest Balances**:
    *   Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those that are 'active' and whose `category` field contains the string 'retail'.
    *   Ensure that these merchants have at least one balance record using `HAS(balances) == 1`.
    *   For each of these qualifying merchants, determine their most recent balance. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as the balance amount from the `MerchantBalances` record with the latest `updated_at` timestamp for that merchant.
    *   This is achieved by accessing the merchant's `balances` sub-collection, ranking the balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order (this ranking is done per merchant using `per=""Merchants""`), selecting the entry with rank 1 (the latest), and then extracting its `balance` value using `SINGULAR()`.
    *   This process results in a temporary collection, `active_merchants_latest_balances`, where each row corresponds to a qualifying merchant and contains their `latest_balance_amount`.

2.  **Calculate the Median Balance**:
    *   Using the `Ewallet` (top-level) context, calculate the median of all `latest_balance_amount` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` function will compute a single value representing the median wallet balance across all selected merchants. If any `latest_balance_amount` is null, it will be ignored in the median calculation.

Explanation:
- The first `CALCULATE` method is applied to the `UserSessions` collection. It computes a new field `session_len_seconds` for each session, representing the duration of the session in seconds by finding the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`.
- The `PARTITION` method then groups these sessions based on their `device_type`. Each group is named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.
- The second `CALCULATE` method operates on these partitioned groups.
    - `device_type = device_type`: This selects the `device_type` (which is the key for the partition).
    - `average_duration_seconds = AVG(UserSessions.session_len_seconds)`: This calculates the average of the `session_len_seconds` (computed in the first step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. `UserSessions.session_len_seconds` refers to the `session_len_seconds` field that was conceptually added to each record of `UserSessions` by the initial `CALCULATE` operation.

3.  For the remaining merchants, calculate new fields:
    *   `m_id`: The merchant's ID (`mid`).
