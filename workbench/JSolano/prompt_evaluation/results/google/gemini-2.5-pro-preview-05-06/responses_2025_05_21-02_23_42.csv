**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer that passes the filter, this step calculates new fields.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for that customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express the rate as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting records (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate`) are sorted in ascending order based on the `success_rate`.

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter customers whose `email` address ends with "".com"".
4.  Further filter these customers to include only those who have made at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols. The `HAS` function combined with `ISIN` will be used for this.
5.  Count the number of such distinct customers using the `COUNT` function on the filtered customer set.
6.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, calculated at the `Broker` graph level.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_who_bought_faang = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: This filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_symbols` list (using `ISIN`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `join_date >= ""2023-01-01""`: This selects customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023.
        *   `status == ""Active""`: This further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result, `filtered_customers`, is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., the TAC).

2.  **`tac_per_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))` groups these customers by the `country` field. Each group in `country_groups` will contain customers from the same country.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `country=country`: This selects the `country` field for the output. Since `country` was a partitioning key, it can be directly referenced.
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the number of customers within each country group. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the records in the `Customers` sub-collection implicitly available for each partition. This gives us the ""Total Active Customers"" count for that specific country.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the relevant 8-week period. This period starts 56 days (8 weeks) before the beginning of the current week and ends just before the current week begins.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that:
    *   Are for ""stock"" tickers. We'll assume the `ticker_type` field in the `Tickers` collection is 'stock' for this purpose.
    *   Fall within the defined 8-week time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected transaction, we calculate a standardized week identifier (`week_start_iso`). This is the start date of the week the transaction belongs to, formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD"" for clear grouping and sorting.
4.  **Group by Week**: We partition (group) these transactions by the `week_start_iso`.
5.  **Calculate Counts per Week**: For each week group:
    *   `total_stock_txns`: We count all transactions belonging to that group.
    *   `weekend_stock_txns`: We count transactions within that group where the `date_time` falls on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", determined using the `DAYNAME()` function.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by the week identifier in descending order, showing the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `start_of_current_week` and `eight_weeks_ago_from_start_of_current_week`: These lines define the boundaries for our 8-week analysis period, ensuring we exclude the current week.
2.  `transactions_for_partitioning`:
    *   This variable holds transactions that meet our initial criteria:
        *   `Transactions.ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Filters for transactions related to stocks. (Note: The actual value for 'stock' in `ticker_type` might vary, e.g., ""STK"", ""Equity"". ""stock"" is assumed here).
        *   The `date_time` conditions ensure transactions are within the desired 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these transactions, it computes `week_start_iso`.
        *   `DATETIME(Transactions.date_time, 'start of week')` truncates the transaction's timestamp to the start of its week.
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` are used to format this week-start-date into a ""YYYY-MM-DD"" string, which serves as a unique identifier for each week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=(week_start_iso))`: This groups the `transactions_for_partitioning` by the `week_start_iso`. Each group represents one of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = week_start_iso`: Selects the week identifier.
        *   `total_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions within that specific week's group. `Transactions` here refers to the records from the base `Transactions` collection that fall into the current partition group and meet the initial filtering criteria.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(Transactions.date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts transactions within the current week's group where the `DAYNAME()` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.DESC())`: Sorts the weekly summaries, showing the most recent week first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of last week. This is done by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), finding the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and then subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
        *   `_start_of_current_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week, which serves as the exclusive end boundary for last week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` clause builds upon the first one:
        *   It accesses `Customers` from the `Broker` collection.
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")` filters these customers to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made` then accesses all transactions made by these US-based customers.
        *   Another `.WHERE(...)` clause filters these transactions based on their `date_time`:
            *   `date_time >= _start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of last week.
            *   `date_time < _start_of_current_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current week.
        *   The result of this filtering is assigned to a temporary variable `_filtered_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   The third `CALCULATE` clause takes the `_filtered_transactions` collection:
        *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(_filtered_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions that met all the criteria.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these filtered transactions.

The final result, `last_week_transactions_summary`, will be a collection with a single row containing two columns: `number_of_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`, representing the requested data for customers from the USA for transactions made last week.",22.125521421432495,"# Define the start and end dates for ""last week""

        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer.
    *   The result, `customer_transaction_summary`, is a new collection where each row contains the customer's name, their total number of transactions, and their total transaction amount.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This part takes the `customer_transaction_summary` collection (generated in the previous step) as input.
    *   It uses another `CALCULATE` function to:

        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (`CR`). The `RANKING` function is applied to the `customer_transaction_summary` collection. It ranks customers based on their `total_trans_amount` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the customer with the highest total transaction amount receives rank 1.

4.  Group these transactions by the `ticker_symbol_val` using `PARTITION`.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), count the number of transactions. This count represents the number of buy transactions for that symbol in the specified period. This is done using `CALCULATE(ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_val, num_buy_transactions = COUNT(Transactions))`.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected customer, we create a standardized 'YYYY-MM' string representing their signup month. This will be used for grouping.
4.  **Group by Signup Month**: We use the `PARTITION` function to group these customers by their signup month.

1.  Filter the `DailyPrices` collection to retain only the records from the last 7 days. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to compare the `date` of each record with the current date (`'now'`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') < 7` ensures we get records from today (difference 0) up to 6 days ago.
2.  From these filtered daily prices, we need the `ticker.ticker_type` to group by. We use `CALCULATE` to create a field `ttype` for `ticker.ticker_type`, as partition keys must be directly accessible fields. The `close` price is implicitly carried forward.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `ttype` (the ticker type).
4.  For each partition (i.e., for each ticker type), calculate the average of the `close` prices. The `AVG(DailyPrices.close)` will operate on the `close` prices of the records within each ticker type group from the filtered set.
5.  The final `CALCULATE` selects the `ticker_type` (renaming `ttype`) and the calculated `average_closing_price`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `daily_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') < 7)`:
    *   This line starts with the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   It filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of the current day. `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and `'now'`. A value less than 7 (i.e., 0 to 6) means the record falls within the desired 7-day window.

2.  `daily_prices_info = daily_prices_last_7_days.CALCULATE(ttype=ticker.ticker_type)`:
    *   This line takes the filtered `daily_prices_last_7_days`.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to add a new field named `ttype`. The value of `ttype` is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, which accesses the `ticker_type` of the `ticker` associated with each daily price record. This is necessary because `PARTITION` requires its `by` keys to be simple, calculated fields. The original `close` field from `DailyPrices` is implicitly available in `daily_prices_info`.

3.  `acp_by_ticker_type = daily_prices_info.PARTITION(name=""ticker_type_group"", by=ttype).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line partitions the `daily_prices_info` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""ticker_type_group"", by=ttype)` groups the records based on the unique values of the `ttype` field (which represents the ticker type).
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these groups:
        *   `ticker_type=ttype`: Selects the ticker type for the output, using the value of the partition key `ttype`.
        *   `average_closing_price=AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: Calculates the average closing price for each group. `AVG(DailyPrices.close)` computes the average of the `close` field from the `DailyPrices` records that belong to the current `ticker_type` group and met the initial 7-day filter.

1.  **Filter Customers by Join Year**: Select only customers who joined in the year 2022.
2.  **Determine Transaction Status and Activity Status**: For these selected customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), False otherwise.
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's status is 'Active' (`status == 'Active'`), False otherwise.
3.  **Group by Country**: Partition the customers (with their flags) by their `country`.
4.  **Calculate Counts for AR**: For each country group:
    *   `num_active_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022, are 'Active', AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022 AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: Apply the formula: `AR = (num_active_with_transactions / num_total_with_transactions) * 100.0`. If `num_total_with_transactions` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  **Select Output Fields**: The final result will include the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_with_flags`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)` filters these customers to include only those who joined in 2022.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then processes these filtered customers to:
        *   Extract the `country` and assign it to `customer_country`.
        *   Create a boolean flag `has_transactions_flag`, which is true if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
        *   Create a boolean flag `is_active_flag`, which is true if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.

2.  `ar_components_by_country`:
    *   This step takes `customers_joined_2022_with_flags` and partitions them by `customer_country` using `PARTITION(name=""customers_in_country_group"", by=(customer_country))`. Each group, named `customers_in_country_group`, contains customers from the same country who joined in 2022, along with their calculated flags.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(...)` operates on each country group:
        *   `output_country_name = customer_country`: Selects the country name for the group.
        *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who are both active (`is_active_flag` is true) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the numerator for the AR.
        *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the denominator for the AR.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the per-country counts from the previous step.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio.
        *   It checks if `num_total_with_transactions` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.
        *   If it is, AR is calculated as `(num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions`.
        *   Otherwise (if `num_total_with_transactions` is 0), AR is set to `0.0`.

4.  `result = activity_ratio_by_country`: Assigns the final result to the variable `result`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_customers` that will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` starts with 'j'. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching for the name.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` ends with 'ez'. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching.
6.  **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two name conditions. A customer satisfies this part if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `state` ends with 'a'. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching for the state.
8.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name condition (itself a combination of two conditions) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria and the state criteria to be included in the count.
9.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of customers that satisfy the combined filter conditions.",9.747397899627686,"filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters these transactions to include only those where `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   It further filters by `date_time` to include transactions from exactly one month ago up to the current moment, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` for the start and `DATETIME('now')` for the end of the period.
    *   In the same step, it uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields:
        *   `ticker_s`: Extracts the stock symbol from the related `ticker` sub-collection (`ticker.symbol`).
        *   `current_transaction_amount`: Stores the `amount` of the transaction.
        *   `current_tax_plus_commission`: Stores the sum of `tax` and `commission` for the transaction.
    *   The result of this step is a collection named `sell_transactions_last_month`.

2.  **Group Transactions by Ticker Symbol**:
    *   The `sell_transactions_last_month` collection is then partitioned by `ticker_s` (the ticker symbol).
    *   This groups all filtered sell transactions based on their respective ticker symbols. The partition is named `ticker_group_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Data per Ticker**:
    *   Operating on the `grouped_by_ticker` partitions, another `CALCULATE` is used:
        *   `ticker_symbol_output`: The ticker symbol (partition key `ticker_s`) is carried forward.
        *   `total_amount_from_sells`: For each ticker group, this calculates the sum of `current_transaction_amount` from all transactions belonging to that ticker within the filtered set.
        *   `total_tax_and_commission`: Similarly, this calculates the sum of `current_tax_plus_commission` for each ticker group.
    *   The result is stored in `ticker_aggregates`.

4.  **Calculate SPM and Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` step computes the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) for each ticker using the aggregated values:
        *   `ticker_symbol`: Renames `ticker_symbol_output` for the final output.
        *   `spm`: Calculated using the formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_tax_and_commission) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.
        *   To prevent division by zero errors if `total_amount_from_sells` is 0, an `IFF` function is used. If `total_amount_from_sells` is 0, `spm` is set to `0.0`; otherwise, the formula is applied.
    *   The `result` variable holds the final output, containing the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `spm`.",45.617069244384766,"# Step 1: Filter transactions for ""sell"" type and within the last month.

1.  **Prepare Daily Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, extract the ticker symbol from the related `ticker` object and format the date into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. Select the close, high, and low prices.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared daily data by ticker symbol and the formatted month. For each group (each ticker-month), calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price. This will result in a new collection where each row represents a specific ticker for a specific month with its aggregated price data.
3.  **Prepare for MoMC Calculation**: Partition the monthly aggregated data from the previous step by ticker symbol. This grouping is necessary so that the `PREV` function can operate correctly within each ticker's data to find the previous month's average closing price.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**:
    *   Access the monthly aggregated data within each ticker's group.
    *   Use the `PREV` window function to get the `average_closing_price` from the previous month for the same ticker. The months will be ordered chronologically.
    *   Calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where there is no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker) or if the previous month's average closing price is zero, in which case MoMC will be `None`.
5.  **Final Selection**: Ensure the final output contains only the requested fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_month_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `CALCULATE` method is used to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_identifier=_id`: Selects the customer's `_id` and renames it to `customer_identifier`.
        *   `customer_name_val=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name_val`.
        *   `transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions a customer made in the same calendar month and year they joined.
            *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It filters the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
            *   The `WHERE` clause condition `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))` ensures that only transactions where the transaction's year and month match the customer's `join_date` year and month are considered.
            *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts these filtered transactions.

2.  **`highest_transaction_customer = customer_join_month_transactions.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the result from the previous step (`customer_join_month_transactions`).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This selects the top 1 customer based on the `transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order. This effectively finds the customer with the highest number of transactions in their join month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` formats the output to return only the requested fields:
        *   `_id=customer_identifier`: The customer's ID.
        *   `name=customer_name_val`: The customer's name.

    *   `total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: For each customer, we calculate the sum of the `amount` from all their associated transactions (accessed via the `transactions_made` sub-collection). This sum is aliased as `total_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Filtering**:
    *   First, a `date_condition` is defined to filter transactions. It selects transactions where the `date_time` is on or after January 1, 2023, and before April 1, 2023. Using `DATETIME(<date_string>, 'start of day')` ensures comparisons are made from the beginning of the respective days. This range inclusively covers all transactions from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(date_condition)` applies this filter to the `Transactions` collection, resulting in `filtered_transactions_by_date`.

2.  **Grouping and Aggregation**:
    *   `filtered_transactions_by_date.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))` groups the filtered transactions based on their `transaction_type`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`:  The transaction type itself.
        *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT` is used on `customer_id` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
        *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG` is used on `shares` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
    *   This step results in `transaction_type_summary`, a collection where each row represents a transaction type with its associated distinct customer count and average shares.

3.  **Selecting Top 3**:
    *   `transaction_type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` takes the `transaction_type_summary` and selects the top 3 records.
    *   The ranking is based on `num_distinct_customers` in descending order (`DESC()`), so transaction types with more distinct customers rank higher.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The final `result` variable holds a collection containing the `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares` for the top 3 transaction types as requested.",39.35403609275818,"# Define the date range condition for filtering transactions

Explanation:
1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We first process the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields: `cust_state` (derived from `transaction.customer.state`) and `tick_type` (derived from `transaction.ticker.ticker_type`).
2.  `state_ticker_combinations = transaction_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transaction_details` collection.
    *   `name=""combinations_group""`: Names the partitioned groups.
    *   `by=(cust_state, tick_type)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After partitioning, we calculate new fields for each group:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**:
    *   This part of the query starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` function to group the customers based on their `country`. Each group is internally named `country_groups` (though this internal name is not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for accessing partition keys).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(country_name=country, num_customers=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   After partitioning, `CALCULATE` is applied to each group (each country).
    *   `country_name=country`: This selects the `country` field (which was used as a partitioning key) and renames it to `country_name` in the output.
    *   `num_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the total number of customers within each country group and names this new field `num_customers`. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the customer records within the current partition (i.e., for each specific country).

3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=num_customers.DESC())`**:
    *   This function takes the collection of countries (each with its `country_name` and `num_customers`) produced by the previous step.
    *   It selects the top 5 records based on the `num_customers` field.
    *   `num_customers.DESC()`: Specifies that the sorting should be in descending order, so countries with the highest number of customers appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, we calculate three new fields:
        *   `country_of_customer`: Retrieves the country of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.country`).
        *   `transaction_amount_val`: Stores the transaction's `amount`.
        *   `transaction_datetime`: Stores the transaction's `date_time`. This is done to use it in the subsequent `WHERE` clause.

2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now') <= 30)`**:
    *   This filters the transactions, keeping only those that occurred within the last 30 days.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's date/time and the current moment.
    *   The condition `<= 30` ensures we include transactions from today (0 days ago) up to and including 30 days ago.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country_of_customer))`**:
    *   The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by the `country_of_customer`.
    *   Each group, named `country_groups` internally, will contain all transactions from a specific country that occurred in the last 30 days.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each country group created by the `PARTITION` step, we calculate:
        *   `country_name`: This is the `country_of_customer` for the current group.
        *   `num_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`) within the current country group. `Transactions` here refers to the sub-collection of transactions belonging to this specific country after filtering.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: This sums the `transaction_amount_val` for all transactions (`SUM(Transactions.transaction_amount_val)`) within the current country group.

5.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, this selects the top 5 country groups based on the `total_transaction_amount`, ordered in descending order (highest amount first).

1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these prices to include only those for the ticker symbol 'VTI'.
3.  Further filter these prices to include only those from the last 7 days. We can achieve this by calculating the difference in days between the price's `date` and the current date using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` and ensuring this difference is less than or equal to 6 (to cover today and the 6 previous days, making a total of 7 days).
4.  From these filtered prices, find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be calculated at the `Broker` graph level to provide a single aggregated value.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with a `status` of ""successful"".
2.  From these successful transactions, calculate the `year` and `month` of the `date_time`. We also need to carry forward the `price` for aggregation.
3.  Further filter these transactions to include only those occurring in the 1st quarter of 2023 (Year 2023, and Months 1, 2, or 3).
4.  Partition the filtered transactions by year and month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This selects only transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each successful transaction:
    *   `transaction_year = YEAR(date_time)`: Extracts the year from the `date_time` field.
    *   `transaction_month = MONTH(date_time)`: Extracts the month from the `date_time` field.
    *   `price = price`: Ensures the original `price` field is available for later aggregation.
3.  `.WHERE((transaction_year == 2023) & ISIN(transaction_month, (1, 2, 3)))`: This filters the records to include only those from January (1), February (2), or March (3) of the year 2023, effectively selecting the 1st quarter of 2023. The resulting collection is named `transactions_q1_2023_successful`.
4.  `transactions_q1_2023_successful.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered transactions by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`. Each group is named `monthly_group`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the original `Transactions` items that fall into the current partition.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by year in ascending order, and then by month in ascending order.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the time window for the ""last 8 calendar weeks, excluding the current week"". This involves calculating the start of the current week, then finding the start date of the 8-week period (8 weeks prior to the current week's start) and the end date of this period (which is the start of the current week, making the period exclusive of the current week). These boundaries are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level graph) context.
2.  **Filter Sales and Access Payments**: We select sales with a `sale_price` greater than $30,000 and then access their associated payments (`Sales.payment`).
3.  **Process Payments**: For each payment, we calculate:
    *   `payment_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the payment occurred.
    *   `is_weekend_day`: A boolean indicating if the payment was made on a Saturday or Sunday.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: We filter these processed payments to include only those whose `payment_week_start` falls within our defined 8-week period.
5.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**: The filtered payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start`. For each week, we calculate:
    *   `week`: The start date of the week.
    *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments in that week.
    *   `weekend_payments_received`: The count of payments made on a weekend in that week.

This is done to ensure that filtering and grouping operations are case-insensitive as requested.
*   Next, `filtered_cars_by_vin` selects cars from `cars_data_prepared` where the `processed_vin` (lowercase VIN) contains 'm5'. The `LIKE` operator with `'%m5%'` ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' anywhere in the VIN.
*   Finally, `result` is obtained by partitioning `filtered_cars_by_vin`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(processed_make, processed_model))` groups the cars by unique combinations of their lowercase make and model.

If the sale date is today, the difference is 0. If it was 29 days ago, the difference is 29. Thus, `<= 29` covers a 30-day period including today.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation on the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, the specified fields will be computed.

2.  **`first_name = first_name,`**: Selects the `first_name` of the salesperson.
3.  **`last_name = last_name,`**: Selects the `last_name` of the salesperson.

4.  **`total_sales_amount = SUM(sales_made.sale_price),`**: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson.
    *   `sales_made` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each salesperson.
    *   `sale_price` is a field within each `Sale` record.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these sale prices to get the total sum for that salesperson. It's assumed that if a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.

5.  **`number_of_sales = COUNT(sales_made),`**: This counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.
    *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.

6.  **`SR = RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`**: This calculates the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.
    *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank.
    *   `by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC()` specifies that the ranking should be based on the total sales amount (re-calculated here as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` to ensure it's available for the `RANKING` function context), in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank. The default behavior for ties (assigning the same rank) is assumed.

1.  Access the `Cars` collection.
2.  Filter these cars using a `WHERE` clause. The condition will check if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. We use `LIKE` with wildcards (`%`) for partial matching and `LOWER()` for case-insensitivity.
3.  For each car that matches the filter, use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select the `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `vin_number`.
    *   Calculate the `avg_sale_price` by applying the `AVG()` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field of the `sale_records` sub-collection associated with each car. If a car has no sale records, `AVG()` will typically result in a null value for `avg_sale_price`.

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""GMC Ford"", ""fordable""). `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains ""mustang"".
*   `|`: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'Ford' OR its model contains 'Mustang'.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These expressions select the respective car details directly.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record.

The metrics are for the last 6 full months, excluding the current month. The results should be ordered by month, and months are to be represented in ""YYYY-MM"" format.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Range**:
    *   `window_start_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. For example, if the current month is August 2023, this will be February 1, 2023.
    *   `window_end_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the current month. Sales on or after this date are excluded. This ensures we only consider sales from the 6 full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**:
    *   `selected_salespersons`: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023.

3.  **Process Sales Data**:
    *   `sales_in_scope`:
        *   Accesses `sales_made` from the `selected_salespersons`.
        *   For each sale, it calculates `sale_month_start_datetime` by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month. This is used for grouping and filtering by month.
        *   The `sale_price` is carried forward as `price_of_sale`.
        *   Filters these sales to include only those where `sale_month_start_datetime` falls within the defined 6-month window (`>= window_start_date_val` and `< window_end_date_val`).

4.  **Aggregate Monthly Metrics**:
    *   `monthly_sales_summary`:
        *   Takes `sales_in_scope` and partitions it by `sale_month_start_datetime`. This groups all sales by the calendar month they occurred in.
        *   For each month group:
            *   `month_date_value`: Stores the actual datetime value for the start of the month (from the partition key).
            *   `pmsps_val`: Calculates PMSPS by counting the number of sales (`COUNT(sales_in_scope)`) within that month's group.
            *   `pmsr_val`: Calculates PMSR by summing the `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month's group. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a month had sales but they all summed to null (or if `SUM` on an empty set is null), it would show 0.0.
        *   Orders the results chronologically by `month_date_value`.

5.  **Format Output**:
    *   `final_monthly_metrics`:
        *   Takes the `monthly_sales_summary`.
        *   Formats the `month_date_value` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (e.g., ""2023-02"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for two-digit month padding.
        *   Selects the final fields: `month` (the formatted string), `PMSPS` (from `pmsps_val`), and `PMSR` (from `pmsr_val`).

**Note on ""all months""**: This solution will list months for which there was at least one sale from the selected salespersons within the specified period. If one of the 6 months in the window had zero sales from this group, that month would not appear in the output, as PyDough's `PARTITION` typically creates groups based on existing data. The requirement ""Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0"" is met for months that have data to form a partition; `DEFAULT_TO` handles the zero metrics in such cases. Generating rows for months with absolutely no underlying data would require a different approach, like using a calendar dimension, which is not explicitly available or standard in these PyDough examples.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the first quarter (January, February, March) of the year 2023.
3.  Calculate the average of the `sale_price` for these filtered sales.
4.  The result will be a single value representing the ASP.

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We use the `AVG` aggregation function on the `sale_price` of the `Sales` collection.
- The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only sales records where:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures the sales are from the year 2023.
    - `(MONTH(sale_date) >= 1) & (MONTH(sale_date) <= 3)` ensures the sales are from the first quarter (January, February, or March).
- The `AVG` function then computes the average of `sale_price` for these filtered sales.",7.0619237422943115,"asp_q1_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(

2.  Calculate the average of these day differences across all payments.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because the final result is a single aggregated value (the overall average).
2.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_diff=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.

    *   The result of this difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_diff`.
3.  `.days_diff`: This accesses the list of `days_diff` values calculated in the previous step.
4.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of all the `days_diff` values.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: `GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023**: We'll start by accessing the `Sales` collection and filtering for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **Calculate Total Revenue**: For these 2023 sales, the total revenue is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  **Calculate Total Cost**: For the cars sold in 2023, the total cost is the sum of the `cost` of each car. The cost of the car is accessed via the `car` relationship from a `Sale` record (i.e., `Sales.car.cost`).
4.  **Apply GPM Formula**: Using the calculated total revenue and total cost, we apply the GPM formula. This calculation is done at the `Dealership` level to produce a single GPM value for all relevant sales.
5.  **Structure**: We use a `CALCULATE` clause on the `Dealership` collection to compute `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023`. A subsequent `CALCULATE` clause is used to compute the `gpm_value` based on these intermediate results.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from all sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

    total_cost_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    # The result will be a single GPM value for the year 2023.
    gpm_value = (total_revenue_for_2023 - total_cost_for_2023) / total_cost_for_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following steps:

1.  It starts at the `Dealership` level, which is the top-level collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` clause computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023`: This is the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records in the `Sales` collection where the year of `sale_date` is 2023.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023`: This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales records in 2023. It accesses the car's cost via `Sales.car.cost`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause uses the `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023` values (calculated in the previous step) to compute the `gpm_value` according to the provided formula.
4.  The final result, `gpm_calculation`, will be a collection containing a single row with one column: `gpm_value`, representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",35.18033242225647,"gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting from the `Sales` collection and applies a filter.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated `car` has at least one `inventory_snapshot` that meets the specified criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')))`: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the car.

        *   `DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')`: Compares the `snapshot_date` with the `sale_date` of the sale, ensuring they fall on the same calendar day by truncating both to the start of the day.

The result should include all months present in the data, ordered chronologically.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Extract Year and Month**:
    First, we process the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, we extract the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions. These are stored as `pay_year` and `pay_month`.

2.  **Group by Month and Calculate Monthly Totals**:
    The `payments_info` collection (containing `pay_year`, `pay_month` for each payment) is then partitioned by `pay_year` and `pay_month`. This creates groups for each unique year-month combination present in the data.
    For each group, we calculate:
    *   `year_of_payment`: The year of the payment group.
    *   `month_of_payment`: The month of the payment group.
    *   `total_payments_this_month`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values from `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into the current year-month group. This gives the total payments for that specific month.

3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    On the `monthly_payment_summary` (which contains total payments for each month), we perform further calculations:
    *   `previous_month_total_payments`: We use the `PREV()` window function to get the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding month. The `by=(year_of_payment.ASC(), month_of_payment.ASC())` clause ensures that ""previous"" is determined chronologically. A `default=0.0` is provided for the `PREV` function; this means for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the `previous_month_total_payments` will be 0.0.
    *   `month_over_month_change`: This is calculated as `total_payments_this_month - previous_month_total_payments`, adhering to the specified definition.

4.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the results are ordered by `year_of_payment` and then `month_of_payment` in ascending order to present a chronological view of monthly payments and their MoM changes.

The query will include entries for all year-month combinations for which there is at least one payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` table. If a month has no payment records, it will not appear in the output.

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))`: This calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date.
    *   `<= 6`: We filter for sales where this difference is less than or equal to 6. This means:
        *   If the sale was today, the difference is 0 days.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those salespersons who have at least one sale record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. This is crucial to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  The first `CALCULATE(...)` then computes:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_sales_value=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales made by the salesperson.
    *   `count_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales made by the salesperson.
3.  The second `CALCULATE(...)` builds upon the previous result:
    *   It retains `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name`.
    *   `calculated_asp=total_sales_value / count_of_sales`: Computes the Average Selling Price (ASP) for each salesperson.
4.  `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 salespersons based on their `calculated_asp` in descending order.
5.  The final `CALCULATE(...)` formats the output to return only the requested fields:
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`
    *   `last_name=sp_last_name`
    *   `ASP=calculated_asp`

1.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate their total sales amount. This is done by summing the `sale_price` from their associated sales records (found in the `sales_made` sub-collection). We'll also select their ID, first name, and last name, storing them temporarily.
3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the 5 salespersons with the highest `total_sales_amount`. The sorting will be in descending order, and any NULL values for total sales will be placed last, as requested.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to format the output, renaming the fields to `ID`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `total_sales_amount` as specified.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `temp_id = _id`: The salesperson's ID.
    *   `temp_first_name = first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
    *   `temp_last_name = last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
    *   `temp_total_sales = SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: The total sales amount for the salesperson. `sales_made` is a sub-collection of sales records linked to the salesperson, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `SUM()` aggregates these prices.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Sorts the salespersons by `temp_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that if any salesperson has a NULL total sales amount, they are placed at the end of the sorted list (and thus are unlikely to be in the top 5).

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step selects the required fields and renames them as per the request for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**:

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links cars to their sales) is empty for each car. The `== 1` is used because `HASNOT` returns a boolean-like value (1 for true, 0 for false in this context).

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each sale:
        *   `car_make_field`: Stores the `make` of the car associated with the sale (e.g., `Sales.car.make`).
        *   `car_model_field`: Stores the `model` of the car associated with the sale (e.g., `Sales.car.model`).
        *   `sale_price_val`: Carries over the `sale_price` of the sale. While `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` is used later, explicitly selecting it here ensures clarity if we were to sum `sale_price_val`. The current solution directly uses `Sales.sale_price` in the aggregation, which is also valid as per PyDough's context within partitions.

2.  `grouped_by_model = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the `sales_with_details` collection and partitions it.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""model_sales_group"", by=(car_make_field, car_model_field))`: Groups the sales records based on unique combinations of `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make=car_make_field, model=car_model_field, total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price), total_sales_num=COUNT(Sales))`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `make=car_make_field`: Selects the car make for the group.
        *   `model=car_model_field`: Selects the car model for the group.
        *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to the current make/model group. This gives the total revenue for that model.
        *   `total_sales_num=COUNT(Sales)`: Counts the number of sales records within the current make/model group. This gives the total number of sales for that model.

3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue = grouped_by_model.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the `grouped_by_model` collection (which contains each model's make, model, total revenue, and total sales count).
    *   `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` selects the top 5 records, ordered by the `total_revenue` field in descending order.

1.  **Define the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week runs from Monday to Sunday.
    *   We first determine the start of the current week. Assuming `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week (which is consistent with ISO week conventions).
    *   The previous ISO week's Monday (`prev_week_start_dt`) is then 7 days before the start of the current week.
    *   The previous ISO week's Sunday (`prev_week_end_dt`) is 1 day before the start of the current week.
    *   These dates are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level) collection.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `prev_week_start_dt` and `prev_week_end_dt` (inclusive).

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For each filtered payment, we extract the day part of the `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` to ensure aggregation is done on a daily basis. This will be `pay_day_key`.
    *   The `payment_method` will be `pay_method_key`.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   The prepared payment data is then partitioned by `pay_day_key` and `pay_method_key`. This creates groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   For each group, we calculate the sum of `payment_amount` using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.

5.  **Output**:
    *   The result will show the payment day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_base_data`: Filters sales to include only those from the year 2023. It then calculates `customer_state_attr` (customer's state), `sale_month_attr` (month of sale), and `sale_year_attr` (year of sale).
2.  `sales_with_quarter_month`: Takes the previous result and calculates `q_start_month_attr`, which is the first month number of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, etc.).
3.  `sales_for_partition`: Constructs `quarter_date_key`, a string representing the first day of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This uses `JOIN_STRINGS` to combine the year, the formatted quarter start month (using `LPAD` to ensure two digits), and ""01"" for the day.
4.  `quarterly_sales_by_state`: This is the final step.
    *   It partitions the `sales_for_partition` data using `customer_state_attr` and `quarter_date_key` as grouping keys.
    *   Within each group (a unique combination of state and quarter), it calculates:
        *   `state`: The customer's state.
        *   `quarter_representation`: The string representing the first date of the quarter.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales falling into that specific state and quarter. `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates values from the original `Sales` collection context corresponding to the records in each partition group.
5.  `result`: The variable `result` holds the final dataset with total quarterly sales grouped by customer state.",88.9497561454773,"# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and extract necessary attributes like customer state, sale month, and sale year.

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by operating on the top-level `Dealership` collection to determine a global value: the latest snapshot date in March 2023.
    *   `MAX(InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).snapshot_date)`: This part filters all `InventorySnapshots` to include only those where the `snapshot_date` falls in March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) of the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). From these filtered snapshots, it selects the maximum `snapshot_date`.
    *   This maximum date is then assigned to a new field `latest_date_in_march_2023`. `latest_snapshot_info` becomes a collection with a single row containing this calculated date.

2.  `result = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).car.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection within the context of `latest_snapshot_info`. This makes the `latest_date_in_march_2023` field available for filtering.
    *   `.WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: This filters the `InventorySnapshots` to keep only those records where:
        *   `snapshot_date` is equal to the `latest_date_in_march_2023` (the latest snapshot date we found for March 2023).
        *   `is_in_inventory` is `True` (meaning the car was in inventory for that snapshot).
    *   `.car`: For each snapshot that meets the criteria, we navigate to the related `car` record.
    *   `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`: Finally, for each selected car, we retrieve its `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`, as requested.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the average Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each drug based on the provided definition.

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection and aims to calculate new fields for each drug.
    *   `drug_name_output=drug_name`: It selects the `drug_name` and assigns it to `drug_name_output`.
    *   `avg_ddd_value=AVG(...)`: It calculates the average DDD for the drug and assigns it to `avg_ddd_value`.

2.  **`AVG(treatments_used_in. ... .individual_treatment_ddd)`**: This part computes the average of DDD values derived from the treatments associated with each drug.
    *   `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.
    *   `.WHERE((HASNOT(end_dt) == 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
        *   `HASNOT(end_dt) == 0`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total duration of the treatment in days is positive. This is crucial to avoid division by zero or undefined DDDs for zero-duration treatments. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of full days between the start and end dates.
    *   `.CALCULATE(individual_treatment_ddd=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD.
        *   `tot_drug_amt`: This is the total drug amount consumed during that specific treatment.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the total days of that specific treatment.
        *   The result of the division is the DDD for that single treatment, assigned to `individual_treatment_ddd`.
    *   `.individual_treatment_ddd`: This extracts the calculated `individual_treatment_ddd` values from the inner `CALCULATE` operation, forming a collection of DDDs for all relevant treatments of the current drug.
    *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `individual_treatment_ddd` values, yielding the `avg_ddd_value` for the drug.

If a drug has no treatments that meet the specified criteria (e.g., all its treatments have a null `end_dt` or a non-positive duration), the `avg_ddd_value` for that drug will be null.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date References Calculation (`date_references`):**
    *   The query first calculates the year and month for three specific time periods: the last full month (M-1), the month before last (M-2), and two months before last (M-3). This is done relative to the current date using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` as a base and subtracting 1, 2, or 3 months.
    *   These date components (`m1_year_val`, `m1_month_val`, etc.) are calculated at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level, making them available as context for subsequent operations on the `Treatments` collection.

2.  **Filtering and Augmenting Treatments (`treatments_in_target_months`):**
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection via `date_references.Treatments`.
    *   For each treatment, it extracts the `treatment_yr` (year of `start_dt`) and `treatment_mth` (month of `start_dt`).
    *   It stores the `patient_id` as `patient_identifier` for later distinct counting.
    *   It adds a boolean flag `is_biologic_drug_treatment` which is true if the treatment's associated drug has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these augmented treatments, keeping only those whose `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth` match one of the three target months calculated in `date_references`.

3.  **Partitioning and Aggregation (`monthly_patient_summary`):**
    *   The `treatments_in_target_months` collection is then partitioned by `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth`. This groups all treatments by the month they occurred in.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each of the target months that has treatment data):
        *   `month_label`: A display string for the month is created in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-10"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `distinct_patient_count`: `NDISTINCT` is used on `treatments_in_target_months.patient_identifier` to count the unique number of patients who received any treatment in that specific month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count`: `NDISTINCT` is used on `treatments_in_target_months.WHERE(is_biologic_drug_treatment == True).patient_identifier`. This first filters the treatments within the month to include only biologic drug treatments, and then counts the unique number of patients who received such treatments.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_label` in descending order, so the most recent of the three months appears first.

4.  **Final Result (`result`):**
    *   The `monthly_patient_summary` variable holds the final result, which will contain rows for each of the last three months (that had treatment data), with columns: `month_label`, `distinct_patient_count`, and `biologic_treatment_patient_count`.",80.64817667007446,"# Step 1: Calculate the year and month for the three target months (last month, month before last, two months before last)

1.  Define the relevant time period:

    *   The start of the period (inclusive) is 6 months prior to the start of the current month.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `end_dt_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines a variable `end_dt_exclusive`. It uses the `DATETIME` function to get the current timestamp (`'now'`) and then truncates it to the 'start of month'. This effectively gives us the first moment of the current month, which will serve as the exclusive upper bound for our date filter.
2.  `start_dt_inclusive = DATETIME(end_dt_exclusive, '-6 months')`: This line defines `start_dt_inclusive`. It takes the `end_dt_exclusive` (start of the current month) and subtracts 6 months from it. This gives us the first moment of the month that was 6 months ago, serving as the inclusive lower bound for our date filter.
3.  `alice_treatment_count = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`), which is suitable for producing a single aggregated result.
4.  `num_treatments_last_6_months = COUNT(...)`: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `num_treatments_last_6_months`. Its value will be the count of treatments that meet the specified criteria.
5.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only those patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
6.  `.treatments_received`: From the filtered patients, we access their associated treatments through the `treatments_received` sub-collection.
7.  `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_dt_inclusive) & (start_dt < end_dt_exclusive))`: This filters the treatments further. A treatment is included if its `start_dt` (start date) is on or after `start_dt_inclusive` AND before `end_dt_exclusive`. This ensures we only count treatments within the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.

1.  First, for each doctor, we calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by navigating from the `Doctors` collection to their `prescribed_treatments`, then to the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique `drug_id`s. We also select the doctor's ID and specialty, using intermediate names for clarity and potential renaming.
2.  Next, we partition this collection of doctors (now with their distinct drug counts) by their specialty. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  Finally, for the doctors within each specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed (in descending order, so more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures this ranking is done independently for each specialty. We also format the output fields to match the requested names (`doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs`, `SDRSDR`).

**Explanation:**

The query is designed to provide a ranked list of doctors based on the diversity of drugs they prescribe, with the ranking performed within each medical specialty.

1.  **`doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `doc_id_val=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID and assigns it to `doc_id_val`.
    *   `speciality_val=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty and assigns it to `speciality_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs_val=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: This calculates the number of unique drugs prescribed by each doctor. It navigates through `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments for the doctor), then to the `drug` for each treatment, and finally to the `drug_id` of that drug. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `drug_id`s. If a doctor has prescribed no drugs, this count will be 0.

2.  **`specialty_partition = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection (where each doctor now has their distinct drug count).
    *   `name=""specialty_group_partition""`: Names the resulting partition structure.
    *   `by=(speciality_val)`: Groups the doctors based on their `speciality_val`. All doctors with the same specialty will be in the same group within this partition.

3.  **`result = specialty_partition.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `specialty_partition.Doctors`: This accesses the individual doctor records within each group of the partition created in the previous step.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id=doc_id_val`: Assigns the doctor's ID to the output field `doc_id`.
        *   `specialty=speciality_val`: Assigns the doctor's specialty to the output field `specialty`. Note the change in spelling from the database field `speciality` to the requested `specialty`.
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs_val`: Assigns the count of distinct drugs to `number_of_distinct_drugs`.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC(), per=""specialty_group_partition"", allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (doctors prescribing more unique drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., Rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_group_partition""`: Crucially, this ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group. A doctor's rank is relative to other doctors in the same specialty.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors within the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each item represents a doctor and includes their `doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs` they prescribed, and their `SDRSDR` rank within that specialty.",80.78063559532166,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors`**: We start by accessing the `Doctors` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: This clause filters the doctors based on the specified conditions.
    *   **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the doctor's `first_name` starts with 'j'. Using `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
    *   **`CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the doctor's `last_name` contains the substring 'son'. `LOWER()` makes this check case-insensitive as well.
    *   **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so a doctor is included if their first name starts with 'J' (case-insensitive) OR their last name contains 'son' (case-insensitive).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This clause selects and renames the desired fields for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window**:
    *   `current_month_start_expr = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: Calculates the first day of the current month.
    *   `twelve_months_ago_start_expr = DATETIME(current_month_start_expr, '-12 months')`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 12 months before the start of the current month.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_in_relevant_window`)**:
    *   `Treatments.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Treatments` collection to include only records where `start_dt` is within the last 12 full months (i.e., greater than or equal to `twelve_months_ago_start_expr` and less than `current_month_start_expr`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `treatment_year_month_str`: Creates a string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") from `start_dt`. `LPAD` is used to ensure the month is always two digits for correct sorting and formatting. This effectively truncates `start_dt` to the month for aggregation.
        *   `patient_id_for_calc=patient_id`: Makes the `patient_id` available under a new name for use in the subsequent `PARTITION` step, which is good practice to avoid ambiguity.

3.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics (`monthly_diagnoses_and_treatments`)**:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_data_group"", by=(treatment_year_month_str))`: Groups the `treatments_in_relevant_window` data by the `treatment_year_month_str`. Each group represents a unique month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each monthly group:
        *   `year_month_period=treatment_year_month_str`: Selects the year-month string for the output.
        *   `PMTC=COUNT(Treatments)`: Calculates the Per Month Treatment Count (PMTC) by counting all treatments within that month's group.
        *   `PMPD=NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_for_calc)`: Calculates the Per Month Patient Diagnoses (PMPD) by counting the number of unique patient IDs (`patient_id_for_calc`) who received treatments (and thus diagnoses) in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(year_month_period.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the year-month period.

4.  **Assign to `result`**:
    *   The final result containing `year_month_period`, `PMTC`, and `PMPD` for each of the last 12 months (excluding the current month) is assigned to the `result` variable.",31.945363759994507,"# Define expressions for the start of the current month and 12 months prior

3.  For this specific drug, access its associated treatments via the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
4.  For each of these treatments, access the `patient` record.
5.  From each patient record, get their `weight_kg`.
6.  Calculate the average of these `weight_kg` values using the `AVG` aggregation function.

1.  `Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin')`: This part filters the `Drugs` collection to select only the drug(s) named 'Drugalin'. Assuming `drug_name` is unique or we are interested in any drug with this name, this will result in a collection containing 'Drugalin'.
2.  `.CALCULATE(average_patient_weight_kg = AVG(treatments_used_in.patient.weight_kg))`: This part calculates a new field `average_patient_weight_kg`.
    *   `treatments_used_in`: This refers to the list of treatments where the selected drug ('Drugalin') was used.
    *   `.patient`: For each treatment in `treatments_used_in`, this accesses the corresponding patient record.
    *   `.weight_kg`: This accesses the `weight_kg` attribute of each of these patient records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_data`**:
    *   Starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   For each patient, `MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)` finds the earliest start date among all their treatments. `YEAR()` then extracts the year from this date. This year is stored as `year_first_treatment`.
    *   `.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)` filters out patients who have no treatments, as they cannot be ""new patients"" by the given definition.

2.  **`new_patients_by_year`**:
    *   Takes `patient_first_treatment_data` and partitions it by `year_first_treatment`. This groups all patients who had their first treatment in the same year.
    *   For each year group, `CALCULATE` creates:
        *   `year_val`: The year of the first treatment (from the partition key).
        *   `num_new_patients_for_year`: The `COUNT(Patients)` within that group, effectively counting the number of new patients for that year.

3.  **`ordered_new_patients_by_year`**:
    *   Sorts the `new_patients_by_year` collection in ascending order based on `year_val`. This ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function used in the next step.

4.  **`final_npi_calculation` (assigned to `result`)**:
    *   This step calculates the final required fields:
        *   `year`: Renamed from `year_val`.
        *   `number_of_new_patients`: Renamed from `num_new_patients_for_year`.

            *   For the very first year in the sorted list, there is no preceding record, so `PREV` returns `None`.

1.  Filter the `Outcomes` collection to include only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. This ensures that we only consider outcomes with complete data for these two timepoints.
2.  From this filtered set of outcomes, calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` and the average `day100_pasi_score` across all relevant treatments.
3.  Apply the D7D100PIR formula: `(avg_day100_pasi - avg_day7_pasi) / avg_day7_pasi * 100.0`.

The final result should be a single percentage value.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))`
    *   This line filters the `Outcomes` collection.
    *   It keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. This resulting collection, `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`, is used for subsequent average calculations.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`
    *   We start a calculation at the `DermTreatment` (the main graph) level to compute overall aggregate values.
    *   `avg_overall_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.
    *   `avg_overall_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.

3.  `.CALCULATE(d7d100pir_value = ...)`
    *   This chained `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step.
    *   `d7d100pir_value = (avg_overall_day100_pasi - avg_overall_day7_pasi) / avg_overall_day7_pasi * 100.0`: This line applies the D7D100PIR formula. The result is named `d7d100pir_value`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

The final `result` will be a collection with a single row and a single column `d7d100pir_value`, containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those who have at least one outcome assessment. An outcome assessment is recorded in the `Outcomes` collection, which is linked to a `Treatment`. Patients receive `Treatments` (via `treatments_received`), and each `Treatment` can have `outcome_records`.
3.  We can use the `HAS` function to check if a patient's treatments have any associated outcome records: `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1`.
4.  For the filtered patients, select their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.
5.  Since we are selecting these fields from the `Patients` collection (where each patient is already unique), the resulting list will inherently be distinct.

    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This condition checks if there is at least one outcome record linked to any of the patient's treatments. Only patients who satisfy this condition are kept.
3.  `.CALCULATE(p_id=patient_id, p_first_name=first_name, p_last_name=last_name)`: For each patient who meets the criteria, this step selects their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. The fields are renamed to `p_id`, `p_first_name`, and `p_last_name` respectively to distinguish them from the original field names.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  **`num_matching_treatments = COUNT(Treatments.WHERE(...))`**: We want to count the number of `Treatments` that satisfy a set of conditions. The `COUNT` function will tally the treatments returned by the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection. A treatment must meet all the following conditions (combined with `&`):
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment.
        *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Checks if the lowercase diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"". The `%` are wildcards matching any sequence of characters.
    *   **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**:
        *   `drug.fda_appr_dt`: Accesses the FDA approval date of the drug used in the treatment.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if this field is present (not null), indicating the drug is FDA-approved.
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**:
        *   Ensures that the treatment has an `end_dt` (end date) recorded.
    *   **`(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`**:
        *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time 6 months prior to the current moment.
        *   `end_dt >= ...`: Checks if the treatment's end date is on or after this date (i.e., within the last 6 months).
    *   **`(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**:
        *   `DATETIME('now')`: Represents the current date and time.
        *   `end_dt <= ...`: Checks if the treatment's end date is on or before the current moment.

Together, these conditions identify treatments for diagnoses related to 'psoriasis', using FDA-approved drugs, and which concluded in the six-month period leading up to and including today.

1.  **Determine the Target Registration Year**: We calculate the year corresponding to ""2 years ago"" by subtracting 2 from the current year, obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`.
2.  **Filter Doctors**: We select doctors from the `Doctors` collection whose `year_reg` matches this target year. We also ensure these doctors have at least one prescribed treatment using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`.
3.  **Identify the First Treatment**: For each selected doctor, we need to find their earliest prescribed treatment.
    *   We access the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection.
    *   We use the `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)` function to rank treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `per=""Doctors""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each doctor. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single treatment is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date (though the specific tie-breaking rule is implicit).
    *   We filter for the treatment where this rank is 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR()` is then used to convert the resulting single-item collection into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields.
4.  **Select and Rename Fields**: We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`, and from their first treatment, the `start_dt` (as `first_treatment_date`) and `treatment_id` (as `first_treatment_id_val`). We interpret ""treatment _id"" as the `treatment_id` field from the `Treatments` collection, as it's the primary identifier for treatments.

2.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt) >= 0`**: This condition ensures that the adverse event's `reported_dt` is on or after the `start_dt` of the associated treatment. `treatment.start_dt` accesses the `start_dt` from the related `Treatments` record.

    *   It computes a new field named `age_in_years` for each patient.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`), effectively giving their current age in integer years.
5.  **`.age_in_years`**: This accesses the `age_in_years` field (computed in the previous step) from the collection of filtered and age-calculated patients. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these ages.
6.  **`average_age = ...`**: The final result of the average calculation is assigned to a field named `average_age` within the output of `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`.

3.  Return the merchant's name and the calculated CPUR.

We will use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
-   The first `CALCULATE` will compute the intermediate values: the count of distinct coupons used in successful transactions and the count of distinct successful transactions for each merchant.
-   The second `CALCULATE` will use these intermediate values to compute the final CPUR and select the merchant's name and the CPUR.

    successful_tx_count=COUNT(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection.
2.  `merchant_name_field=name`: We select the merchant's `name` and assign it to `merchant_name_field`.
3.  `distinct_coupons_in_successful_tx_count=NDISTINCT(...)`:
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon_id) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were `""successful""` and had a `coupon_id` (meaning a coupon was used).
    *   `.coupon_id`: We then take the `coupon_id` from these filtered transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: This function counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s, giving us the ""number of distinct coupons used"" for successful transactions by that merchant.
4.  `successful_tx_count=COUNT(...)`:
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were `""successful""`.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of such successful transactions, giving us the ""number of distinct transactions"" (since each transaction record is distinct).
5.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` (stored in `merchant_intermediate_stats`) is then passed to a second `CALCULATE`.
6.  `merchant_name=merchant_name_field`: We select the merchant's name for the final output.
7.  `cpur=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
    *   `IFF(successful_tx_count > 0, ... , null)`: This is a conditional expression.
    *   If `successful_tx_count` is greater than 0, it calculates `distinct_coupons_in_successful_tx_count / successful_tx_count`.
    *   Otherwise (if `successful_tx_count` is 0), it returns `null` for the CPUR to handle division by zero.
8.  The final `result` will contain the `merchant_name` and its corresponding `cpur`.",53.02182674407959,"# Step 1: Calculate intermediate statistics for each merchant.

1.  **Define Target Weeks**: First, we calculate the start dates of the three weeks preceding the current week. These will be used to filter notifications. We use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to make these dates available for subsequent operations.
2.  **Filter Users**: We select users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Access Notifications**: For these selected users, we access their `notifications`.
4.  **Enhance Notification Data**: For each notification, we calculate two new pieces of information:
    *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start of the week in which the notification was created. This is done by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_on_weekend`: A boolean flag indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME(created_at)`.
5.  **Filter Notifications by Target Weeks**: We then filter these processed notifications to include only those whose `notification_actual_week_start` falls into one of the three target weeks defined in step 1.
6.  **Group by Week**: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by their `notification_actual_week_start`. This creates a group for each relevant week.
7.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each weekly group, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for that group.
    *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications in that group (i.e., for that week).
    *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications within that group that were sent on a weekend. This is achieved by summing up a conditional value (1 if `is_on_weekend` is true, 0 otherwise).

This approach ensures that we count notifications only for the specified users, correctly identify the relevant weeks, and aggregate the total and weekend notification counts for each of those weeks.

1.  **Filter User Balances**: We first select records from the `UserBalances` collection where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days. ""Past week, inclusive of 7 days ago"" is interpreted as a continuous 7-day (7 * 24 hours) window ending at the current moment of query execution.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: The problem defines ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". For each user whose wallet was updated in this 7-day window, we calculate their average balance by taking all their recorded balances within this period and averaging them. This is achieved by partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id` and then applying the `AVG()` function to their `balance` amounts.
3.  **Calculate Overall Average AMB**: Finally, we take all the per-user AMB values calculated in the previous step and compute their average. This will give the single ""average balance"" value requested.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `recent_user_balances_filtered`: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection. It keeps only those records where the `updated_at` field is within the time window from exactly 7 days ago up to the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  `user_amb_collection`:
    *   This line takes the `recent_user_balances_filtered` data.
    *   It then uses `PARTITION(name=""user_balances_group"", by=(user_id))` to group these records by `user_id`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each unique `user_id`), `CALCULATE(amb_for_user = AVG(UserBalances.balance))` computes the average of the `balance` values. `UserBalances.balance` here refers to the balances of the records within the current partition (i.e., for a specific user and within the filtered time window). The result, `amb_for_user`, is the AMB for that specific user over the 7-day period.

1.  Access each user in the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, look into their `balances` (which is a list of `UserBalances` records).
3.  Within these balance records, identify the most recent one by finding the record with the maximum `updated_at` timestamp. We can use the `RANKING` window function for this, ordering balances by `updated_at` in descending order for each user.
4.  Select the `balance` amount from this most recent record.
5.  If a user has no balance records, their LUB will be `None`.

        ).SINGULAR().balance,
        None
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: This command iterates through each user in the `Users` collection and calculates new fields for them.
2.  `user_uid=uid, user_username=username`: We select the `uid` and `username` for each user, renaming them to `user_uid` and `user_username` respectively in the output.
3.  `latest_user_balance=DEFAULT_TO(...)`: This calculates the LUB for each user.
    *   `Users.balances`: For the current user, this accesses their list of balance records (from the `UserBalances` collection).
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True) == 1)`:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True)`: This function ranks the balance records for the current user. The ranking is based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (so the latest date gets rank 1). `per=""Users""` ensures that ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances. `allow_ties=True` handles cases where multiple balance records might share the same latest timestamp.
        *   `== 1`: This filters the balance records to keep only those with rank 1 (i.e., the most recent ones).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the `WHERE` clause might technically return a collection (even if it's usually a single item for rank 1), `SINGULAR()` is used to explicitly pick one record.

1.  Access the `setting_snapshots` sub-collection from the `Users` collection. This gives us a collection of all setting snapshots across all users, but importantly, maintains the context of which user each snapshot belongs to.
2.  For each snapshot, calculate its rank among all snapshots for the *same user*, based on the `snapshot_date` in descending order. This is done using the `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")` function. The `per=""Users""` argument ensures the ranking is partitioned by each user.
3.  Filter these ranked snapshots to keep only those with a rank of 1, which corresponds to the latest snapshot for each user.
4.  From these latest snapshots, calculate the `user.uid` (to get the user ID) and the `marketing_opt_in` status.

    opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.setting_snapshots`: We start by accessing the `setting_snapshots` linked to each user. This operation effectively flattens the snapshots into a single collection where each snapshot record is implicitly associated with its parent user.
2.  `.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This function is applied to each snapshot. It ranks snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first). The `per=""Users""` clause is crucial: it ensures that the ranking is performed *within* the group of snapshots belonging to each individual user (the ""Users"" ancestor collection).
    *   `== 1`: We filter the results to keep only the snapshots that have a rank of 1, meaning they are the latest snapshot for their respective user.
3.  `latest_snapshots_per_user.CALCULATE(user_id_val=user.uid, opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in)`:
    *   From the collection of latest snapshots (one per user who has snapshots), we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields.
    *   `user_id_val=user.uid`: We retrieve the user's unique identifier by navigating from the snapshot back to its parent user (`user`) and accessing its `uid` field. The result is named `user_id_val`.
    *   `opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in`: We retrieve the `marketing_opt_in` field directly from the snapshot. This field contains the boolean preference. The result is named `opt_in_status`.

This rank is based on the total amount of money successfully received by the merchant. We need to return the merchant's name, category, their total revenue amount, and this calculated rank.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue. This revenue comes from transactions:
    *   Where the merchant is the receiver (accessed via `transactions_received`).
    *   That were successful (we'll assume `status == ""completed""` indicates success).
    *   Where the `receiver_type` in the transaction data is `1` (as specified in the prompt, indicating the receiver is a merchant).
    The revenue is the sum of the `amount` for these transactions.
3.  After calculating the total revenue for each merchant, we rank them. The merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.
4.  The final output will include the merchant's name, category, the calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

We'll use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
*   The first `CALCULATE` computes the necessary attributes from the `Merchants` collection (name, category) and calculates the `total_revenue_for_merchant`.
*   The second `CALCULATE` takes these intermediate results, renames them to the desired output field names, and computes the `revenue_rank` based on the `total_revenue_for_merchant`.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate total revenue for each merchant from their successfully received transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_revenues_calculated = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `m_name=name` and `m_category=category`: These select the merchant's `name` and `category`, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` for use in the next step.
    *   `total_revenue_for_merchant=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   `transactions_received`: This accesses the list of transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: This filters these transactions to include only those that are ""completed"" (assumed to mean successful) AND where the `receiver_type` is `1` (as per the prompt's requirement for merchant receivers).
        *   `.amount`: This accesses the `amount` of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the amounts of all such transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant.

2.  `final_merchant_data = merchant_revenues_calculated.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the result from the first `CALCULATE` step.
    *   `merchant_name=m_name`, `category=m_category`, `revenue_amount=total_revenue_for_merchant`: These lines select the fields calculated in the previous step and assign them their final output names: `merchant_name`, `category`, and `revenue_amount`.

Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",Ewallet,"The query aims to calculate the Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) for wallet transactions over the last two full months, excluding the current month. Based on the provided definition, PMDAU is taken to mean the count of distinct senders (where `sender_type = 0`) who made transactions within each respective month. The `created_at` timestamp is truncated to the start of the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates the date boundaries for the period of interest.
    *   `current_month_boundary`: The start of the current month. Transactions on or after this date are excluded.
    *   `start_period_boundary`: The start of the month that was two months before the current month. Transactions on or after this date (and before `current_month_boundary`) are included.
    *   For example, if today is July 15th, 2023, `current_month_boundary` would be 2023-07-01, and `start_period_boundary` would be 2023-05-01. The query would consider transactions from May 1st, 2023, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2023 (i.e., transactions in May and June).

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   It accesses the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0`.
    *   Filters transactions to fall within the calculated date range (`>= start_period_boundary` and `< current_month_boundary`).
    *   For each of these filtered transactions, it calculates `transaction_month_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the first day of its month. This field will be used for grouping.

3.  **Calculate PMDAU per Month**:
    *   The prepared transaction data is then partitioned by `transaction_month_start`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `year_val`: The year of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `month_val`: The month number of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `pmdau`: The number of distinct `sender_id` values within that month's transactions. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by year and then by month for a clear, chronological presentation.

This approach directly implements the definition ""PMDAU = distinct sender with sender\_type = 0"" and ""Truncate created\_at to month for aggregation"", interpreting PMDAU as the count of unique active users per month for the specified period.

2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. This calculated duration, along with the `user_id`, will be part of an intermediate collection.

2.  `.CALCULATE(duration_secs = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, this calculates the duration in seconds by subtracting `session_start_ts` from `session_end_ts` using `DATEDIFF`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we are calculating an aggregate value (total count) across a subset of `UserSessions`.
2.  `tuc_count = COUNT(...)`: This defines a new field `tuc_count` which will hold the total number of user sessions.
3.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `UserSessions` collection and apply a filter.
4.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This function call generates a timestamp representing exactly one month prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function call generates the current timestamp.
    *   The condition filters sessions whose `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to one month ago and less than or equal to the current moment, effectively covering the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"".
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `UserSessions` records that satisfy the `WHERE` clause condition.

1.  **Identify the Previous Month**: We'll use date functions to determine the year and month corresponding to the month immediately preceding the current one.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Select transactions that occurred within this identified previous month.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those of `transaction_type == ""wallet""`.
3.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of these filtered wallet transactions from the previous month.
    *   Count how many of_ these transactions had a `status == ""successful""` (assuming ""successful"" is the status string for successful transactions).
4.  **Calculate STR**: Apply the given formula: `STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions`. We'll express this as a percentage and handle cases where the total number of transactions is zero to avoid division errors.
5.  **Return the Result**: The final output should be the calculated STR value.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date_for_calc = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`: This line calculates the date of the first day of the previous month.
2.  `target_year_for_calc = YEAR(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)` and `target_month_for_calc = MONTH(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)`: These lines extract the year and month from the date calculated in the previous step. These will be used to filter transactions.

    *   `YEAR(created_at) == target_year_for_calc) & (MONTH(created_at) == target_month_for_calc)`: Ensures transactions are from the identified previous month.
    *   `transaction_type == ""wallet""`: Filters for wallet transactions. We assume ""wallet"" is the string used in the `transaction_type` field.
4.  `str_calculation_result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` (top graph) level, as we need a single aggregate result.
    *   `num_successful_wallet_tx = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions_filtered.WHERE(status == ""successful""))`: Counts the number of successful wallet transactions from the filtered set. We assume ""successful"" is the string in the `status` field indicating success.
    *   `num_total_wallet_tx = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions_filtered)`: Counts the total number of wallet transactions from the filtered set.
    *   `calculated_previous_month_str = IFF(...)`: Calculates the STR.
        *   `IFF(num_total_wallet_tx > 0, ... , 0.0)`: This checks if there were any wallet transactions. If `num_total_wallet_tx` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `(num_successful_wallet_tx * 100.0) / num_total_wallet_tx` (to get a percentage).
        *   If `num_total_wallet_tx` is 0, STR is set to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:

    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:

    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`**: This selects the desired information for the filtered merchants.

Return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications.,SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM notifications WHERE type = 'transaction';,Ewallet,"To return the distinct list of user IDs who have received transaction notifications, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Notifications` collection.
2.  Filter these notifications to include only those where the `notification_type` indicates a transaction. We'll assume the value for this is `'TRANSACTION'`.
3.  Group the filtered notifications by `user_id` using `PARTITION` to get distinct user IDs.

distinct_user_ids_with_transaction_notifications = Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION').PARTITION(name=""users_partitioned_by_id"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(user_id=user_id)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION')`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection and then filters it to retain only those notifications where the `notification_type` field is equal to `'TRANSACTION'`. This isolates notifications specifically related to transactions.
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""users_partitioned_by_id"", by=(user_id))`: After filtering, this partitions the remaining notifications. The `by=(user_id)` clause groups these notifications based on unique `user_id` values. The `name=""users_partitioned_by_id""` assigns a temporary name to these partitioned groups, though it's not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` in this simple case. The effect of partitioning by `user_id` is that we will operate on each distinct `user_id` once.
3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id=user_id)`: Finally, this selects the `user_id` from each partition. Since the partitioning was done by `user_id`, this effectively produces a list of distinct user IDs who have received at least one transaction notification.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_groups"", by=(device_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.

    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` (i.e., for each unique `device_type`):
        *   We select the `device_type` itself.

    *   `total_amount_redeemed = SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions linked to the coupon. This represents the total monetary value redeemed using that coupon.
*   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())`: After calculating the above fields for all coupons, this function selects the top 3 coupons.

1.  **Identify Relevant Merchants and Their Latest Balances**:
    *   Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those that are 'active' and whose `category` field contains the string 'retail'.
    *   Ensure that these merchants have at least one balance record using `HAS(balances) == 1`.
    *   For each of these qualifying merchants, determine their most recent balance. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as the balance amount from the `MerchantBalances` record with the latest `updated_at` timestamp for that merchant.
    *   This is achieved by accessing the merchant's `balances` sub-collection, ranking the balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order (this ranking is done per merchant using `per=""Merchants""`), selecting the entry with rank 1 (the latest), and then extracting its `balance` value using `SINGULAR()`.
    *   This process results in a temporary collection, `active_merchants_latest_balances`, where each row corresponds to a qualifying merchant and contains their `latest_balance_amount`.

2.  **Calculate the Median Balance**:
    *   Using the `Ewallet` (top-level) context, calculate the median of all `latest_balance_amount` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` function will compute a single value representing the median wallet balance across all selected merchants. If any `latest_balance_amount` is null, it will be ignored in the median calculation.

    *   `HASNOT(...) == 1`: This condition is true if the filtered `notifications` collection (i.e., notifications received within the first year) is empty. This means the user either had no notifications at all, or all their notifications occurred after their first year.
