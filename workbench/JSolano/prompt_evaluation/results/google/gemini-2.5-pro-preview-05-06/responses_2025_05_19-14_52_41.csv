```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer that passes the filter, this step calculates new fields.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for that customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express the rate as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting records (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate`) are sorted in ascending order based on the `success_rate`.

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"".
    *   They must have at least one 'BUY' transaction (`transaction_type == ""BUY""`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. The result will be a single number representing the count of these distinct customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple holding the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction that meets the subsequent criteria.
        *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions made by each customer.
        *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""BUY"") & (ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols)))`: This filters the transactions to include only those where:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the relevant 8-week period. This period starts 56 days (8 weeks) before the beginning of the current week and ends just before the current week begins.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that:
    *   Are for ""stock"" tickers. We'll assume the `ticker_type` field in the `Tickers` collection is 'stock' for this purpose.
    *   Fall within the defined 8-week time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected transaction, we calculate a standardized week identifier (`week_start_iso`). This is the start date of the week the transaction belongs to, formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD"" for clear grouping and sorting.
4.  **Group by Week**: We partition (group) these transactions by the `week_start_iso`.
5.  **Calculate Counts per Week**: For each week group:
    *   `total_stock_txns`: We count all transactions belonging to that group.
    *   `weekend_stock_txns`: We count transactions within that group where the `date_time` falls on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", determined using the `DAYNAME()` function.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by the week identifier in descending order, showing the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `start_of_current_week` and `eight_weeks_ago_from_start_of_current_week`: These lines define the boundaries for our 8-week analysis period, ensuring we exclude the current week.
2.  `transactions_for_partitioning`:
    *   This variable holds transactions that meet our initial criteria:
        *   `Transactions.ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Filters for transactions related to stocks. (Note: The actual value for 'stock' in `ticker_type` might vary, e.g., ""STK"", ""Equity"". ""stock"" is assumed here).
        *   The `date_time` conditions ensure transactions are within the desired 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these transactions, it computes `week_start_iso`.
        *   `DATETIME(Transactions.date_time, 'start of week')` truncates the transaction's timestamp to the start of its week.
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` are used to format this week-start-date into a ""YYYY-MM-DD"" string, which serves as a unique identifier for each week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=(week_start_iso))`: This groups the `transactions_for_partitioning` by the `week_start_iso`. Each group represents one of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = week_start_iso`: Selects the week identifier.
        *   `total_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions within that specific week's group. `Transactions` here refers to the records from the base `Transactions` collection that fall into the current partition group and meet the initial filtering criteria.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(Transactions.date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts transactions within the current week's group where the `DAYNAME()` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.DESC())`: Sorts the weekly summaries, showing the most recent week first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `start_of_current_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: This determines the exact timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday at 00:00:00).
    *   `start_of_last_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: This calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week immediately preceding the current week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   `relevant_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: It selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"". This is achieved by navigating from the `Transactions` collection to the linked `Customers` collection via the `customer` field and then accessing the `country` attribute.
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week_dt) & (date_time < start_of_current_week_dt)`: This ensures that only transactions whose `date_time` falls within the last week are included. The period starts from `start_of_last_week_dt` (inclusive) and ends just before `start_of_current_week_dt` (exclusive), covering the entire previous week.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates**:
    *   `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: The final aggregation is performed at the `Broker` (top) level, producing a single result row.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(relevant_transactions)`: This counts the number of transactions that met the filtering criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name`.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` for each customer).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Select the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`.
        *   Rename `total_trans_amount` to `total_transaction_amount` for the final output.
        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (CR).
            *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank to each customer.
            *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` field in descending order. This means the customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1.

The final `result` will be a collection where each record represents a customer and includes their name, total number of transactions, total transaction amount, and their rank (CR) based on the total transaction amount.",20.391997575759888,"customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month and Year**: For each selected customer, we extract the year and month of their `join_date`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This determines the first moment of the current month.
2.  `start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-6 months')`: This calculates the date 6 months before the start of the current month. For example, if ""now"" is in July, this will be the start of January.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and before `start_of_current_month`. This effectively selects customers from the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.
4.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))`: For these filtered customers, we calculate two new fields: `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`, representing the year and month of their `join_date`.
5.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))`: We group the customers based on the unique combinations of `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`. Each group (`monthly_group`) will contain all customers who signed up in a specific month.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each `monthly_group`:
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val, signup_month=signup_month_val`: We select the year and month for the group.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: We count the number of customers within the current `monthly_group`. `Customers` here refers to the sub-collection of customers belonging to this specific signup month. This gives us the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS).
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the average transaction `amount`. `Customers.transactions_made.amount` accesses all transaction amounts for all customers who signed up in this specific month. The `AVG` function then computes their average, giving us the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT). If customers in a particular month have no transactions, `pmat` will be null for that month.

2.  For these filtered daily prices, we extract the `ticker_type` from the associated `ticker` and the `close` price. These will be named `dp_ticker_type` and `dp_close_price` respectively.
3.  We then `PARTITION` this intermediate collection by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups all the records from the last 7 days by their ticker type.
4.  Finally, for each group (i.e., for each `ticker_type`), we `CALCULATE` the `ticker_type` (which is our partition key) and the `ACP` (Average Closing Price) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `dp_close_price` values within that group.

Explanation:
The PyDough code first creates an intermediate collection `daily_prices_filtered`. This collection contains records from `DailyPrices` that fall within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). For each such record, it includes the `ticker_type` (aliased as `dp_ticker_type`) and the `close` price (aliased as `dp_close_price`).

Next, the `result` is obtained by partitioning `daily_prices_filtered` by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups the data by ticker type. For each `ticker_type` group, the `CALCULATE` function then outputs the `ticker_type` itself and the Average Closing Price (`ACP`), which is computed by averaging the `dp_close_price` values belonging to that specific ticker type group from the `daily_prices_filtered` collection.",30.982137441635132,"# Step 1: Filter DailyPrices for the last 7 days and select relevant fields (ticker_type and close price)

The AR is defined as:
`AR = (Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Based on this definition and the context:
1.  ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" is interpreted as: For a given country, the count of customers who joined in 2022 and have at least one transaction.
2.  ""Total Number of Customers with Transactions"" is interpreted as: For a given country, the total count of customers (regardless of their join year) who have at least one transaction.

The PyDough code will perform the following steps:
1.  For each customer, determine two boolean flags:
    *   `c_is_2022_joiner`: True if the customer joined in the year 2022.
    *   `c_has_tx_flag`: An integer flag (1 if the customer has transactions, 0 otherwise).
2.  Partition the customers by `country`.
3.  For each country:
    *   Calculate the numerator: Sum `c_has_tx_flag` for customers where `c_is_2022_joiner` is true. This counts customers in that country who joined in 2022 and have transactions.
    *   Calculate the denominator: Sum `c_has_tx_flag` for all customers in that country. This counts all customers in that country who have transactions, irrespective of join year.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_flags_info`: We first iterate through all `Customers`. For each customer, we calculate:
    *   `c_is_2022_joiner`: A boolean indicating if `YEAR(join_date)` is 2022.
    *   `c_has_tx_flag`: An integer 1 if the customer has any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), and 0 otherwise. This conversion to 0/1 is useful for summing.

2.  `ar_per_country`: We then partition `customer_flags_info` by `country`. For each `country_group`:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country from the partition key.
    *   `num_2022_joiners_with_tx_in_country`: This is the numerator. We sum `Customers.c_has_tx_flag` only if `Customers.c_is_2022_joiner` is true. This effectively counts customers who both joined in 2022 and have transactions within the current country.
    *   `total_customers_with_tx_in_country`: This is the denominator. We sum `Customers.c_has_tx_flag` for all customers in the current country partition. This counts all customers in the country who have transactions, regardless of when they joined.
    *   `calculated_ar`: The Activity Ratio is calculated as `(numerator * 100.0) / denominator`. We use `IFF` to handle cases where the denominator is zero (no customers with transactions in the country), setting AR to 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.

3.  `result`: Finally, we select only the `country` (renamed from `country_name`) and the calculated `AR` (renamed from `calculated_ar`) for the output.",73.7243320941925,"# Step 1: Calculate flags for each customer: if they joined in 2022, and if they have transactions (as a 0/1 flag).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause is used to filter customers based on specific criteria.

2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with the letter 'j'.

3.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with the substring 'ez'.

4.  **`(STARTSWITH(...) | ENDSWITH(...))`**:
    *   The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions. A customer is selected if their name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez' (case-insensitively).

5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**:
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the customer's `state` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state ends with the letter 'a'.

6.  **`(...name_condition...) & (...state_condition...)`**:
    *   The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition group with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria.

7.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of customers that remained after applying the `WHERE` clause filters.
    *   The result is assigned to a new field `number_of_matching_customers`.",13.361698627471924,"filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(

"What is the SPM for each ticker symbol from sell transactions in the past month, inclusive of 1 month ago?

1.  **Prepare Transactions Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and use `CALCULATE` to make the `ticker.symbol` available as a scalar field (`ticker_symbol_for_partition`). This field will be used for partitioning later. Original transaction fields like `transaction_type`, `date_time`, `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` are carried forward.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions where `date_time` is within the last month. This is achieved by checking if `date_time` is greater than or equal to one month ago from the current moment (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`) and less than or equal to the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`).
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate**:
    *   Use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions by `ticker_symbol_for_partition`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), use `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Preserve the ticker symbol (renamed to `ticker_symbol_output` for clarity).
        *   Calculate the sum of `amount` (as `total_amount_val`).
        *   Calculate the sum of `tax` (as `total_tax_val`).
        *   Calculate the sum of `commission` (as `total_commission_val`).
        These sums refer to the original fields of the `Transactions` collection within each partition.
4.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, calculate the SPM with another `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   The SPM formula is: `(Total Amount - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`.
    *   To prevent division by zero if `total_amount_val` is 0, an `IFF` condition is used: if `total_amount_val` is 0, SPM is set to 0.0; otherwise, the formula is applied. The result is stored in `spm_value`.
5.  **Final Output**: A final `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `ticker_symbol` and `spm`.

1.  **Initial Data Preparation**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, we extract the ticker symbol from the related `Tickers` collection, the year, the month number (1-12), and create a formatted month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). We also carry forward the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Monthly Aggregation**: We partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and by each month (using year, month number, and the formatted month string as keys). For each resulting group (i.e., for each ticker for each month), we calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price using the respective aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) on the original daily prices that fall into that group.
3.  **MoMC Calculation**:
    *   The results from step 2 (monthly aggregates per ticker) are then partitioned again, this time only by ticker symbol. This gives us a series of monthly data for each ticker.
    *   Within each ticker's series of monthly data, we use the `PREV` window function to find the average closing price of the *previous* month. This function requires the data to be ordered by year and month number.
    *   Finally, using the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price (obtained via `PREV`), we calculate the MoMC. The formula is: `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`. We handle cases where the previous month's data is unavailable or its average closing price is zero by setting MoMC to `None`.

The final output will include the ticker symbol, the formatted month, the calculated average closing price, highest price, lowest price for that month, and the MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation on the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_id=_id, c_name=name`: We select the customer's `_id` and `name`, assigning them to temporary variables `c_id` and `c_name` to avoid potential naming conflicts and for clarity in the final selection.
    *   `txn_count_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same calendar month and year as their `join_date`.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for the current customer.
        *   `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))`: This condition ensures that the year of the transaction matches the year of the customer's `join_date`, AND the month of the transaction matches the month of the customer's `join_date`.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: This aggregation function counts the number of transactions that satisfy the `WHERE` condition.
2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=txn_count_join_month.DESC())`: After calculating `txn_count_join_month` for all customers, this operation selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `txn_count_join_month`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the highest count is ranked first.
3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=c_id, name=c_name, number_of_transactions=txn_count_join_month)`: This final `CALCULATE` step formats the output to include the customer's original `_id` (from `c_id`), `name` (from `c_name`), and the calculated count, renaming `txn_count_join_month` to `number_of_transactions` as per the request.",36.43472337722778,"result = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Filtering**:
    *   First, a `date_condition` is defined to filter transactions. It selects transactions where the `date_time` is on or after January 1, 2023, and before April 1, 2023. Using `DATETIME(<date_string>, 'start of day')` ensures comparisons are made from the beginning of the respective days. This range inclusively covers all transactions from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(date_condition)` applies this filter to the `Transactions` collection, resulting in `filtered_transactions_by_date`.

2.  **Grouping and Aggregation**:
    *   `filtered_transactions_by_date.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))` groups the filtered transactions based on their `transaction_type`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`:  The transaction type itself.
        *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT` is used on `customer_id` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
        *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG` is used on `shares` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
    *   This step results in `transaction_type_summary`, a collection where each row represents a transaction type with its associated distinct customer count and average shares.

3.  **Selecting Top 3**:
    *   `transaction_type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` takes the `transaction_type_summary` and selects the top 3 records.
    *   The ranking is based on `num_distinct_customers` in descending order (`DESC()`), so transaction types with more distinct customers rank higher.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The final `result` variable holds a collection containing the `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares` for the top 3 transaction types as requested.",36.42711400985718,"# Define the date range condition for filtering transactions

2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""customers_with_buy_transactions"", by=customer_id)`**: After filtering for 'buy' transactions, this step partitions the resulting records by the `customer_id` field. Partitioning by `customer_id` groups all 'buy' transactions made by the same customer together. When we later select `customer_id` from these partitions, it effectively gives us a distinct list of customer IDs because each partition represents a unique customer who made at least one 'buy' transaction.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)`**: Finally, this selects the `customer_id` from each partition.

distinct_ticker_ids_after_date = DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= ""2023-04-01"").PARTITION(name=""unique_tickers_by_id"", by=(ticker_id)).CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= ""2023-04-01"")`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection and then filters it. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those records where the `date` is on or after April 1, 2023. We assume the `date` field can be directly compared with the string ""2023-04-01"".
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""unique_tickers_by_id"", by=(ticker_id))`: After filtering, the `PARTITION` function is used to group the remaining `DailyPrices` records. It groups them by the `ticker_id` field. This effectively creates a group for each unique `ticker_id` present in the filtered data.
3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is applied to the result of the partitioning. For each unique group (representing a distinct `ticker_id`), it selects the `ticker_id` itself. The field `ticker_id` is directly used as it's the partitioning key.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to derive new fields or select existing ones for each ticker.
    *   **`ticker_symbol=symbol`**: Selects the `symbol` field and renames it to `ticker_symbol` for clarity in the output.
    *   **`number_of_transactions=COUNT(transactions_of)`**: Calculates the total number of transactions associated with each ticker. `transactions_of` is a sub-collection of transactions for each ticker, and `COUNT()` aggregates these.
    *   **`total_amount=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with each ticker. `transactions_of.amount` refers to the `amount` field within each transaction in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.

2.  **`.TOP_K(10, by=total_amount.DESC())`**: This function is applied to the result of the `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   **`10`**: Specifies that we want the top 10 records.
    *   **`by=total_amount.DESC()`**: Sorts the tickers by the `total_amount` (calculated in the previous step) in descending order (`DESC()`), so tickers with the highest total transaction amounts appear first.

The final result, `top_tickers_by_transaction_amount`, will be a collection of the top 10 tickers, each with their `ticker_symbol`, `number_of_transactions`, and `total_amount`.",15.001115560531616,"top_tickers_by_transaction_amount = Tickers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_with_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields:
    *   `cust_state`: This is derived from `customer.state`, accessing the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
    *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, accessing the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `partitioned_transactions = transactions_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transactions_with_details` collection.
    *   `name=""state_ticker_combinations""`: This assigns a name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(cust_state, tick_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the transactions based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

3.  `result = partitioned_transactions.CALCULATE(...).TOP_K(...)`:
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`) created by the `PARTITION` step:
        *   We select the `cust_state` and `tick_type` (which are the partition keys).
        *   We calculate `num_transactions` by counting the number of `Transactions` that fall into that specific group.
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())`: From these aggregated results, we select the top 5 combinations, ordered by `num_transactions` in descending order.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**:
    *   This part of the query starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` function to group the customers based on their `country`. Each group is internally named `country_groups` (though this internal name is not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for accessing partition keys).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(country_name=country, num_customers=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   After partitioning, `CALCULATE` is applied to each group (each country).
    *   `country_name=country`: This selects the `country` field (which was used as a partitioning key) and renames it to `country_name` in the output.
    *   `num_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the total number of customers within each country group and names this new field `num_customers`. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the customer records within the current partition (i.e., for each specific country).

3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=num_customers.DESC())`**:
    *   This function takes the collection of countries (each with its `country_name` and `num_customers`) produced by the previous step.
    *   It selects the top 5 records based on the `num_customers` field.
    *   `num_customers.DESC()`: Specifies that the sorting should be in descending order, so countries with the highest number of customers appear first.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the last 30 days. This is achieved by comparing the `date_time` of each transaction with the current date/time using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`. We ensure the difference is between 0 and 30 days, inclusive.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate the `country_for_grouping` by accessing `customer.country`.
3.  We then partition these transactions by `country_for_grouping`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `final_country_name`: The name of the country from the partition key.
    *   `final_num_transactions`: The total count of transactions for that country within the specified period, using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `final_total_amount`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions for that country within the period, using `SUM(Transactions.amount)`.
5.  We use `TOP_K(5, by=final_total_amount.DESC())` to select the top 5 countries based on the `final_total_amount` in descending order.
6.  Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to present the results with the requested column names: `country`, `number_of_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`vti_prices_in_range = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This line defines a contextless expression named `vti_prices_in_range`.
    *   It starts with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records based on two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This ensures that only records for the ticker symbol 'VTI' are considered. It accesses the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` entity.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters records for the ""past 7 days"".
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` means we include records where the difference is 0 (today), 1 (yesterday), ..., up to 6 (6 days ago). This covers a total span of 7 calendar days.

2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result using the top-level `Broker` collection (representing the entire graph/database).
    *   `CALCULATE(lowest_daily_close_price_vti_past_7_days=MIN(vti_prices_in_range.close))`:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**:

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers.
    *   `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` ensures that only customers who have at least one transaction in their `transactions_made` sub-collection are included. This addresses the requirement ""Ignore customers who haven't made any transactions.""

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This function is used to define the fields to be returned for the filtered customers.
    *   **`customer_id=_id`**: This selects the customer's unique identifier (`_id`) and renames it to `customer_id` in the output.
    *   **`time_from_joining_to_first_transaction_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: This calculates the difference in days between the customer's joining date and their first transaction date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`transactions_for_period`)**:
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those that meet three conditions:
        *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures only successful transactions are considered.
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Restricts transactions to the year 2023.
        *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further restricts transactions to the first quarter (January, February, March).
    *   `CALCULATE` is then used to create two new fields:
        *   `transaction_year`: Extracted year from the `date_time` field.
        *   `transaction_month`: Extracted month from the `date_time` field.
        These fields are essential for grouping in the next step. The original `price` field of the `Transactions` collection remains accessible for aggregation.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`monthly_avg_price_data`)**:
    *   The `transactions_for_period` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`. This groups the transactions by each unique combination of year and month.
    *   Following the `PARTITION`, `CALCULATE` is used to compute the desired output for each group:
        *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
        *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
        *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average transaction `price` for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` field of the original `Transactions` records that belong to the current partition.

3.  **Final Selection (`result`)**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` ensures that the output contains precisely the requested columns: `year`, `month`, and the calculated `monthly_average_price` (renamed from `avg_transaction_price` for clarity).

**Explanation:**

1.  `period_start_date` and `period_end_date`: These variables define the 8-week window we are interested in. `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')` calculates the date 8 weeks before the start of the current week. `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the start of the current week. Payments on or after `period_start_date` and before `period_end_date` are included.
2.  `filtered_sales_payments = Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000).payment`: This line first filters the `Sales` collection for records where `sale_price` exceeds $30,000. Then, it accesses the `payment` sub-collection for these sales, giving us all `PaymentsReceived` records associated with these high-value sales.
3.  `payments_with_details = filtered_sales_payments.WHERE(...)`: This filters the payments to include only those within our 8-week target period.
4.  `.CALCULATE(payment_week_start = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week'), is_weekend_flag = ...)`: For each filtered payment:
    *   `payment_week_start`: Calculates the starting date of the calendar week in which the payment occurred. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_flag`: Assigns 1 if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday (using `DAYNAME` for robustness), and 0 otherwise.
5.  `weekly_payment_counts = payments_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: This partitions the `payments_with_details` collection based on the `payment_week_start`. Each partition group will contain all payments made in the same calendar week.
6.  `.CALCULATE(week = payment_week_start, total_payments_received = COUNT(payments_with_details), weekend_payments_received = SUM(payments_with_details.is_weekend_flag))`: For each week partition:
    *   `week`: Outputs the `payment_week_start` (the partition key) as the identifier for the week.
    *   `total_payments_received`: Counts all payments within that specific week's group from the `payments_with_details` collection.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
2.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29` for this. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days. If the sale date is today, the difference is 0. If it was 29 days ago, the difference is 29. Thus, `<= 29` covers a 30-day period including today.
3.  Use a contextless expression `recent_toyota_sales` to store these filtered sales.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation on the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, the specified fields will be computed.

2.  **`first_name = first_name,`**: Selects the `first_name` of the salesperson.
3.  **`last_name = last_name,`**: Selects the `last_name` of the salesperson.

4.  **`total_sales_amount = SUM(sales_made.sale_price),`**: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson.
    *   `sales_made` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each salesperson.
    *   `sale_price` is a field within each `Sale` record.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these sale prices to get the total sum for that salesperson. It's assumed that if a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.

5.  **`number_of_sales = COUNT(sales_made),`**: This counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.
    *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.

6.  **`SR = RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`**: This calculates the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.
    *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank.
    *   `by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC()` specifies that the ranking should be based on the total sales amount (re-calculated here as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` to ensure it's available for the `RANKING` function context), in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank. The default behavior for ties (assigning the same rank) is assumed.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_snapshot_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car_make_calc=Sales.car.make`, `car_model_calc=Sales.car.model`, `sale_price_calc=Sales.sale_price`: These expressions retrieve the make, model, and sale price for the car involved in the current sale. We use `_calc` suffixes to distinguish these calculated fields.
    *   `latest_snapshot_record=Sales.car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1).SINGULAR()`: This is a crucial part. For the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`), it accesses its `inventory_snapshots`. It then filters these snapshots to find the one with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1`. `SINGULAR()` converts the resulting single-item collection into a single record object, representing the latest inventory snapshot. If no snapshots exist or none match the rank, `latest_snapshot_record` might be null or cause an error if not handled, but `HAS` in the next step manages this.

2.  `filtered_sales = sales_with_snapshot_info.WHERE(...)`:
    *   This step filters the records processed in the previous `CALCULATE`.
    *   `(HAS(latest_snapshot_record) == 1)`: This condition ensures that a `latest_snapshot_record` was actually found for the car. If a car has no inventory snapshots, `latest_snapshot_record` would be null, and this condition would filter out such sales.
    *   `(latest_snapshot_record.is_in_inventory == False)`: This condition checks the `is_in_inventory` field of the found `latest_snapshot_record`. It keeps only those sales where the car is confirmed to be no longer in inventory.

3.  `make_model_aggregation = filtered_sales.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""make_model_group"", by=(car_make_calc, car_model_calc))`: The filtered sales records are now grouped (partitioned) by unique combinations of `car_make_calc` and `car_model_calc`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make=car_make_calc, model=car_model_calc, highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales.sale_price_calc))`: For each group (i.e., for each make and model combination):
        *   `make=car_make_calc`, `model=car_model_calc`: The make and model are output.
        *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales.sale_price_calc)`: The maximum `sale_price_calc` among all sales in that group is calculated. This gives the highest sale price for that specific make and model.

4.  `result = make_model_aggregation.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, the aggregated results (one record per make/model with its highest sale price) are sorted in descending order based on the `highest_sale_price`.

3.  Additionally, ensure that the car has at least one sale record, so that an average sale price can be calculated. This is checked using `HAS(sale_records) == 1`.
4.  For each car that meets these criteria, calculate its average sale price by taking the average of the `sale_price` from all its `sale_records`.
5.  Finally, select the requested fields: `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, `vin_number`, and the calculated `avg_sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the car's `make` contains the substring 'ford'. The `%` are wildcards for partial matching.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the car's `model` contains 'mustang'.
*   `|`: The OR operator combines the two `LIKE` conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'Ford' OR its model contains 'Mustang'.
*   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one sale record. This is important because we need to calculate an `avg_sale_price`.
*   `&`: The AND operator combines the make/model condition with the sale record existence condition.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields.

    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `AVG()` is an aggregation function that computes the average over these sale prices.",25.85541868209839,"selected_cars_with_avg_price = Cars.WHERE(

The metrics are for the last 6 full months, excluding the current month. The results should be ordered by month, and months are to be represented in ""YYYY-MM"" format.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Range**:
    *   `window_start_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. For example, if the current month is August 2023, this will be February 1, 2023.
    *   `window_end_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the current month. Sales on or after this date are excluded. This ensures we only consider sales from the 6 full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**:
    *   `selected_salespersons`: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023.

3.  **Process Sales Data**:
    *   `sales_in_scope`:
        *   Accesses `sales_made` from the `selected_salespersons`.
        *   For each sale, it calculates `sale_month_start_datetime` by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month. This is used for grouping and filtering by month.
        *   The `sale_price` is carried forward as `price_of_sale`.
        *   Filters these sales to include only those where `sale_month_start_datetime` falls within the defined 6-month window (`>= window_start_date_val` and `< window_end_date_val`).

4.  **Aggregate Monthly Metrics**:
    *   `monthly_sales_summary`:
        *   Takes `sales_in_scope` and partitions it by `sale_month_start_datetime`. This groups all sales by the calendar month they occurred in.
        *   For each month group:
            *   `month_date_value`: Stores the actual datetime value for the start of the month (from the partition key).
            *   `pmsps_val`: Calculates PMSPS by counting the number of sales (`COUNT(sales_in_scope)`) within that month's group.
            *   `pmsr_val`: Calculates PMSR by summing the `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month's group. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a month had sales but they all summed to null (or if `SUM` on an empty set is null), it would show 0.0.
        *   Orders the results chronologically by `month_date_value`.

5.  **Format Output**:
    *   `final_monthly_metrics`:
        *   Takes the `monthly_sales_summary`.
        *   Formats the `month_date_value` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (e.g., ""2023-02"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for two-digit month padding.
        *   Selects the final fields: `month` (the formatted string), `PMSPS` (from `pmsps_val`), and `PMSR` (from `pmsr_val`).

**Note on ""all months""**: This solution will list months for which there was at least one sale from the selected salespersons within the specified period. If one of the 6 months in the window had zero sales from this group, that month would not appear in the output, as PyDough's `PARTITION` typically creates groups based on existing data. The requirement ""Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0"" is met for months that have data to form a partition; `DEFAULT_TO` handles the zero metrics in such cases. Generating rows for months with absolutely no underlying data would require a different approach, like using a calendar dimension, which is not explicitly available or standard in these PyDough examples.

```python

1. Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `sale_date` falls within the first quarter (January, February, March) of 2023.
2. Calculate the average of the `sale_price` for these filtered sales.

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We access the `Sales` collection.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures only sales from the year 2023 are considered.
    - `(MONTH(sale_date) >= 1) & (MONTH(sale_date) <= 3)` ensures only sales from January, February, or March are included.

1.  For each payment in the `PaymentsReceived` collection, calculate the difference in days between its `payment_date` and the `sale_date` of the associated sale (accessed via `sale_record.sale_date`).
2.  Calculate the average of these day differences across all payments.
3.  Round the final average to 2 decimal places.
4.  The result will be a single aggregated value, so we'll use `Dealership.CALCULATE`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because the final result is a single aggregated value (the overall average).
2.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_diff=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment, `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of days between the `sale_date` (from the related `Sales` record accessed via `sale_record`) and the `payment_date` of the current payment.
    *   The result of this difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_diff`.
3.  `.days_diff`: This accesses the list of `days_diff` values calculated in the previous step.
4.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of all the `days_diff` values.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `Dealership` top-level collection to calculate a single aggregated GPM value.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step:
    *   We determine the `total_revenue_for_2023_sales`. This is done by filtering the `Sales` collection for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023, and then summing their `sale_price`.
    *   We determine the `total_cost_for_2023_sales`. This involves filtering the `Sales` collection for 2023 sales, accessing the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale, and then summing these costs.
3.  In the second `CALCULATE` step, we use the `total_revenue_for_2023_sales` and `total_cost_for_2023_sales` computed in the previous step to apply the GPM formula.

The final result will be a single value representing the GPM for all sales in 2023.

```python
gpm_for_2023_sales = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023_sales = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of cars sold in 2023
    total_cost_for_2023_sales = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_for_2023_sales - total_cost_for_2023_sales) / total_cost_for_2023_sales * 100
)
```
This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  It initializes a calculation at the `Dealership` level, which is suitable for global aggregations.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023_sales`: It filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales from the year 2023 (using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`) and then sums the `sale_price` of these sales.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023_sales`: Similarly, it filters sales from 2023 and then sums the `cost` of the `car` associated with each of these sales (accessed via `Sales.car.cost`).
3.  The second `CALCULATE` takes these two computed totals (`total_revenue_for_2023_sales` and `total_cost_for_2023_sales`) and applies the GPM formula: `(revenue - cost) / cost * 100`. The result is stored in the `gpm_2023` field.

    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')))`: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the car.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: Ensures the snapshot indicates the car is out of inventory.
        *   `DATETIME(snapshot_date, 'start of day') == DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of day')`: Compares the `snapshot_date` with the `sale_date` of the sale, ensuring they fall on the same calendar day by truncating both to the start of the day.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_on_out_day = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: This line takes the filtered sales (those that occurred on the day the car went out of inventory) and selects the top 1 sale based on `sale_price` in descending order.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:
1.  **Extract Date Components and Alias Amount**:
    *   From the `PaymentsReceived` collection, the `YEAR` and `MONTH` are extracted from the `payment_date`.
    *   The `payment_amount` is aliased to `amount` for clarity in subsequent steps. This forms the `payments_info` collection.

2.  **Aggregate Payments by Month**:
    *   The `payments_info` collection is partitioned by `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
    *   For each year-month group, `SUM(payments_info.amount)` calculates the `total_monthly_payment`. The results are stored with new field names `year_val` and `month_val` to represent the year and month of the aggregation. This forms `monthly_aggregated_payments`.

3.  **Order Monthly Aggregates**:
    *   The `monthly_aggregated_payments` are ordered by `year_val` (ascending) and `month_val` (ascending). This chronological sorting is essential for the correct functioning of the `PREV` window function used in the next step.

4.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    *   A final `CALCULATE` operation is performed on the ordered monthly payments.
    *   The fields are renamed to `year`, `month`, and `total_payments_received` for the final output.
    *   The `mom_change` is calculated as `total_monthly_payment - PREV(total_monthly_payment, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()), default=0.0)`.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_payment, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()), default=0.0)` fetches the `total_monthly_payment` from the previous month in the ordered sequence.
        *   The `by` clause ensures `PREV` operates over the correctly sorted data.
        *   `default=0.0` handles the case for the very first month in the dataset, where there is no preceding month; its MoM change will be calculated against 0.

**Note on ""months with no payments""**: This query will include months that have records in `PaymentsReceived` which might sum up to zero. However, if a calendar month has absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` table, it will not appear in the result, as PyDough operations are based on existing data. The MoM calculation will be relative to the previous month *that has data*.

"What is the TSC in the past 7 days, inclusive of today?TSC = Total Sales Count.","SELECT COUNT(_id) AS TSC FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Dealership,"To calculate the Total Sales Count (TSC) for the past 7 days, inclusive of today, we need to:
1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days (i.e., from 6 days ago up to and including today).
    We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of full days between `sale_date` and the current moment.
    - If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    - If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.
    - If `sale_date` is in the future, the difference will be negative.
    So, the condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` will select sales from today and the preceding 6 days.
3.  Count these filtered sales records.
4.  Assign this count to a field named `TSC`.

```python
total_sales_count_last_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(

        )
    )
)
```
Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because the query asks for a single aggregated value (Total Sales Count).
- `Dealership.Sales` accesses all sales records.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
    - `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    - `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0)` ensures that we only consider sales that happened on or before today (not in the future).
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` ensures that the sales happened within the last 6 days from today (e.g., if today is the 7th, this includes sales from the 1st to the 7th).
    - Combining these with `&` gives us sales from the 7-day period ending today.
- `COUNT(...)` then counts the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.
- The result is assigned to `TSC` in the `CALCULATE` clause.",26.295150995254517,"total_sales_count_last_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",43.066407442092896,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate the duration of their employment in days using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`. We'll store this as `duration_days`. We also carry forward `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone` for the final output, renaming them temporarily (e.g., `temp_first_name`).
3.  Filter these results to include only salespersons for whom `duration_days` is valid (i.e., non-negative). This implicitly handles cases where `termination_date` might be null (if `DATEDIFF` returns null, and `null >= 0` evaluates to false) or where `termination_date` is before `hire_date`. This focuses on salespersons who were actually ""fired"" after being hired.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each record in the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `temp_first_name=first_name`, `temp_last_name=last_name`, `temp_phone=phone`: These expressions select the original `first_name`, `last_name`, and `phone` fields and assign them to temporary names. These are carried forward for the final output.

2.  `.WHERE(duration_days >= 0)`: This filters the results from the previous step. It keeps only those records where `duration_days` is greater than or equal to zero. This ensures we consider only salespersons with a valid employment period (i.e., `termination_date` is on or after `hire_date`) and implicitly filters out those for whom `termination_date` might be null (assuming `DATEDIFF` would return null, and `null >= 0` evaluates to false).
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=duration_days.ASC())`: From the filtered records, this selects the top 1 salesperson. The selection is based on `duration_days` sorted in ascending order (`ASC()`), so it picks the salesperson with the shortest employment duration.
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step formats the output for the selected salesperson.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
    *   We first find the start of the current ISO week (Monday).
    *   The previous ISO week's Monday is 7 days before the current week's Monday.
    *   The previous ISO week ends just before the current week's Monday.
    *   We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` to get the Monday of the current week.
    *   `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-7 days')` gives the Monday of the previous week.
    *   Payments will be filtered such that `payment_date` is greater than or equal to the previous week's Monday and less than the current week's Monday.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   Filter these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated previous ISO week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For daily aggregation, extract the date part from the `payment_date` timestamp using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`.
    *   Select the `payment_method` for grouping. The `payment_amount` will be used for summation.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered and prepared payments by the extracted payment day and the `payment_method`.
    *   For each group (each day and payment method combination), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.

5.  **Output**:
    *   The result will show the payment day, payment method, and the total amount received for that combination.

Here's the PyDough code:

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_context`: This calculates two key dates:
    *   `current_week_monday_dt`: The start (Monday, 00:00:00) of the current ISO week.
    *   `previous_week_monday_dt_val`: The start (Monday, 00:00:00) of the previous ISO week.
2.  `payments_in_prev_week`: This filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to include only payments made during the previous ISO week. The range is from `previous_week_monday_dt_val` (inclusive) to `current_week_monday_dt` (exclusive), covering Monday to Sunday of the previous week.
3.  `payments_to_group`: This step prepares the data for grouping.
    *   `day_of_payment`: Extracts just the date (at midnight) from `payment_date` for daily aggregation.
    *   `method_of_payment`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in partitioning.
    The original `payment_amount` from `PaymentsReceived` is available for records in `payments_to_group`.
4.  `result`: This performs the final grouping and aggregation:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_groups"", by=(day_of_payment, method_of_payment))`: Groups the records from `payments_to_group` first by the `day_of_payment` and then by `method_of_payment`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `payment_day_output = day_of_payment`: Selects the day for the output.
        *   `payment_method_output = method_of_payment`: Selects the payment method for the output.
        *   `total_amount_received_daily = SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` from the original `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into the current day/method group. This provides the daily total amount for each payment method.

    *   `c_state_key`: The state of the customer who made the purchase, obtained from `Sales.customer.state`.
    *   `q_start_date_key`: A string representing the first date of the quarter in which the sale occurred. This is constructed by:
        *   Determining the year (which is 2023).
        *   Determining the first month of the quarter (1 for Q1, 4 for Q2, 7 for Q3, 10 for Q4) based on `MONTH(sale_date)`.
        *   Formatting this month number with leading zero if necessary (e.g., ""01"", ""04"", ""07"", ""10"") using `LPAD`.
        *   Joining the year, formatted month, and ""01"" (for the day) with hyphens to form a date string like ""2023-01-01"".
3.  The original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records is implicitly carried forward with these calculated attributes.
4.  Partition the resulting records by `c_state_key` (customer's state) and `q_start_date_key` (quarter start date).
5.  For each group (i.e., each unique combination of customer state and quarter start date), calculate the `total_sales_output` by summing the `sale_price` of all sales falling into that group.
6.  The final result will include the customer's state (`customer_state_output`), the quarter representation (`quarter_representation_output`), and the calculated total sales (`total_sales_output`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_prepared = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, we define two new fields for each of these sales records:
        *   `c_state_key`: This captures the `state` of the `customer` associated with the sale.
        *   `q_start_date_key`: This constructs a string representing the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`.
            *   `YEAR(sale_date)` provides the year (2023).
            *   The nested `IFF(ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), ...), ...)` statements determine the first month of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, 7 for Jul-Sep, 10 for Oct-Dec).
            *   `LPAD(..., 2, ""0"")` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"", ""04"", ""07"", ""10"").
            *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ..., ""01"")` combines these parts into a date string like ""2023-01-01"".
    *   The original `sale_price` field from the `Sales` records is carried over implicitly.

2.  `result = sales_prepared.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_prepared` data. The `by=(c_state_key, q_start_date_key)` clause groups the records by unique combinations of customer state and the calculated quarter start date.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these groups:
        *   `customer_state_output=c_state_key`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_representation_output=q_start_date_key`: Selects the quarter start date string for the group.
        *   `total_sales_output=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group (i.e., for that specific state and quarter). This gives the total quarterly sales for that group.

2.  From these March 2023 snapshots, identify the ""latest"" ones. We use the `RANKING` window function, ordering by `snapshot_date` in descending order. `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), allow_ties=True) == 1` will select all snapshots that fall on the most recent date within March 2023, allowing for multiple snapshots if they share the exact latest timestamp.
3.  Further filter these latest snapshots to include only those where the car is marked as being in inventory, i.e., `is_in_inventory == True`.
4.  For each of these filtered inventory snapshots, access the associated `car` record.
5.  Finally, select the requested car details: `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`.

Explanation:
The PyDough code first filters the `InventorySnapshots` to get all snapshots taken in March 2023.
Then, within these March 2023 snapshots, it applies a second `WHERE` clause:

    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection. For each drug, we will calculate its name and its average Defined Daily Dose (DDD).

2.  **`drug_name = drug_name`**: This selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection to be included in the output.

3.  **`average_ddd_value = AVG(...)`**: This calculates the average DDD for each drug. The `AVG` function aggregates DDD values calculated from the drug's associated treatments.

4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: This accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.

5.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total days of treatment is a positive value. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the duration of the treatment in full days. This condition prevents division by zero (if duration is 0) or illogical negative DDDs (if duration is negative).

6.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_ddd = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD:
    *   `tot_drug_amt`: Represents the ""total drug amount consumed during one treatment"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: Represents the ""total days of treatment"".
    *   The result is named `treatment_ddd`.

7.  **`.treatment_ddd`**: After calculating `treatment_ddd` for all valid treatments of a drug, this expression provides these individual DDD values to the `AVG` function.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name` and its corresponding `average_ddd_value`. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria (e.g., all treatments have null end dates or non-positive durations), its `average_ddd_value` will likely be null.",39.35354161262512,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Augment Treatment Data**: For each treatment, we calculate:
    *   `p_id`: The `patient_id`.
    *   `d_type`: The `drug_type` from the associated drug (e.g., 'biologic').
    *   `treatment_month_start`: The first day of the month in which the treatment started. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `month_offset_from_current`: The number of full months between the treatment's start month and the start of the current month. A value of 1 means last month, 2 means the month before last, and so on.

2.  **Filter Relevant Treatments**: We filter these augmented treatments to include only those that occurred in the last three full months, i.e., where `month_offset_from_current` is 1, 2, or 3.

3.  **Partition by Month**: The filtered treatments are then partitioned by `treatment_month_start`. This creates groups of treatments for each of the three relevant months.

4.  **Calculate Monthly Statistics**: For each monthly partition:
    *   We format the `treatment_month_start` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for the `month` output.
    *   `patient_count`: We count the number of distinct patient IDs (`p_id`) within that month's treatments.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: We first filter the treatments within the month to include only those where `d_type` is 'biologic', and then count the number of distinct patient IDs (`p_id`) from this subset.

5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in descending order, showing the most recent of the three months first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, preparing to compute a single aggregated value.
2.  **`count_of_patients = COUNT(...)`**: This defines the field we want to compute, `count_of_patients`. Its value will be the count of patients who meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`DermTreatment.Patients.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `Patients` collection and filters it. Only patients who satisfy the condition inside the `WHERE` clause will be considered for the count.
4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition for each patient.
    *   `treatments_received`: This accesses the list of treatments associated with each patient.
    *   `.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))`: This filters the `treatments_received` for each patient. It keeps only those treatments where:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris'`: The name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
        *   `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`: The type of the drug used in the treatment is 'biologic'.
        *   The `&` operator ensures both conditions must be true for a treatment to be selected.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the filtered list of `treatments_received` (i.e., treatments matching both diagnosis and drug type criteria) is not empty for the current patient. If a patient has at least one such treatment, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   `start_date_for_period`: This expression calculates the start of the relevant period. It first gets the start of the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`) and then subtracts 6 months (`'-6 months'`). For example, if the current date is July 15th, 2024, the start of the current month is July 1st, 2024. Subtracting 6 months yields January 1st, 2024.
    *   `end_date_for_period`: This expression defines the end of the relevant period (exclusive). It's simply the start of the current month (`DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`). So, treatments must have a `start_dt` *before* this date. Using the example above, this would be July 1st, 2024.
    *   The period effectively covers the 6 full months prior to the current month (e.g., January to June if the current month is July).

2.  **Main Query Logic**:
    *   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: The query starts from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to produce a single aggregated result.
    *   `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to find all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"". If multiple patients share this name, their treatments will be collectively considered.
    *   `.treatments_received`: For the selected patient(s), it accesses their received treatments.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_date_for_period) & (start_dt < end_date_for_period))`: This filters the treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the defined date range:
        *   `start_dt >= start_date_for_period`: The treatment started on or after the first day of the month 6 months ago.
        *   `start_dt < end_date_for_period`: The treatment started before the first day of the current month.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of treatments that satisfy all the preceding conditions (patient named Alice and treatment date within the specified range).
    *   `num_treatments_for_alice = ...`: The final count is assigned to the field `num_treatments_for_alice`.

The query will return a single row with one column, `num_treatments_for_alice`, indicating the total number of treatments for patient(s) named Alice in the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.",29.331185340881348,"# Define the date boundaries as contextless expressions.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step selects and renames the fields to be returned.
    *   `description=description`: Selects the `description` field from the `AdverseEvents` collection.

We'll store this along with the doctor's ID and specialty.
2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We then partition these doctors based on their `speciality`. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  **Rank within Specialty**: Within each specialty group (partition), we rank the doctors. The ranking (`SDRSDR`) is based on the `num_distinct_drugs` (calculated in step 1) in descending order, so doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a better (lower number) rank. The `per` clause of the `RANKING` function will refer to the named partition to ensure ranking is done independently for each specialty.
4.  **Select Final Fields**: Finally, we select the required fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, `num_distinct_drugs`, and the calculated `SDRSDR`.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor,
# along with their ID and specialty.
doc_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(
    doc_id=doc_id,
    speciality_field=speciality,  # Use an intermediate name for the specialty field
    num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)
)

# Step 2: Partition the doctors by their specialty.
# The 'Doctors' collection items (now represented by 'doc_info') are grouped by 'speciality_field'.
# The name ""specialty_partition"" will be used to refer to these groups in the ranking step.
# Then, we access the 'Doctors' items within each partition to perform calculations on individual doctors.

    name=""specialty_partition"",
    by=(speciality_field)

    doc_id=doc_id,  # Original doc_id from Doctors
    speciality=speciality_field,  # The specialty by which it was partitioned
    num_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs,  # The count calculated in doc_info
    SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_partition"")  # Rank within the specialty_partition
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `doc_info = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   It calculates three fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `speciality_field`: The doctor's specialty. We use an intermediate name `speciality_field` to make it distinct for partitioning.
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`. It counts the number of unique drug IDs found across all treatments prescribed by the doctor.

2.  `result = doc_info.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `doc_info` collection (which contains doctors with their distinct drug counts).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_partition"", by=(speciality_field))`: It partitions the doctors into groups based on their `speciality_field`. Each group is named `specialty_partition`.

3.  `.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   After partitioning, `.Doctors` accesses the individual doctor records within each `specialty_partition`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then computes the final set of fields for each doctor within their specialty group:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID.
        *   `speciality`: The doctor's specialty (taken from the `speciality_field` partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: The previously calculated count of distinct drugs.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""specialty_partition"")`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (more drugs = better rank, i.e., rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_partition""`: This crucial part ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group (partition). Doctors are only ranked against other doctors in the same specialty.

The final `result` variable will contain a collection where each record represents a doctor with their ID, specialty, the number of distinct drugs they prescribed, and their rank within that specialty based on this count.",69.81198239326477,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor,

3.  Filter Treatments: Select only those treatments whose truncated `start_dt` falls within our 12-month window.

**Explanation:**

1.  `time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two key date boundaries at the highest level (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `calc_current_month_start`: The first day of the current month (e.g., if today is 2023-07-15, this will be 2023-07-01).
    *   `calc_twelve_months_ago_start`: The first day of the month that was 12 months before `calc_current_month_start` (e.g., 2022-07-01).
2.  `treatments_prepared = time_boundaries.Treatments.CALCULATE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection. For each treatment, we calculate `calc_treatment_month` by truncating its `start_dt` to the first day of its month. This allows for monthly aggregation.
3.  `filtered_treatments_by_date = treatments_prepared.WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments to keep only those whose `calc_treatment_month` falls within our target 12-month period. This period starts from `calc_twelve_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and ends just before `calc_current_month_start` (exclusive), effectively giving us 12 full months prior to the current month.
4.  `monthly_metrics_calc = filtered_treatments_by_date.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `filtered_treatments_by_date` by `calc_treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month.
    *   Within each monthly group, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `report_month`: The month for which the metrics are calculated (this is the `calc_treatment_month` partition key).
        *   `PMPD_val`: Per Month Patient Diagnoses, calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id`s in that month's treatments. This counts how many unique patients received at least one diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
        *   `PMTC_val`: Per Month Treatment Count, calculated as the total count of `Treatments` in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(report_month.ASC())` ensures the results are sorted chronologically.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`:
    *   Starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`: Filters out patients who have no treatment records.
    *   `CALCULATE(first_treatment_year_val = YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))`: For each remaining patient, it finds the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` from all their `treatments_received`. `YEAR()` extracts the year from this date. This year is stored as `first_treatment_year_val`. Each row in this result represents a patient and the year they became a ""new patient"".

2.  `new_patients_by_year_counts`:
    *   Takes `patient_first_treatment_info`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year_val)`: Groups the patients based on their `first_treatment_year_val`.
    *   `CALCULATE(year_val = first_treatment_year_val, num_new_patients_val = COUNT(Patients))`: For each group (i.e., for each year), it outputs the `year_val` and counts the number of patients (`COUNT(Patients)`) in that group. This count is the `num_new_patients_val` for that year.

3.  `sorted_new_patients_by_year`:
    *   Takes `new_patients_by_year_counts`.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year_val.ASC())`: Sorts the yearly counts in ascending order by year. This is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly.

4.  `yearly_npi_data`:
    *   Takes `sorted_new_patients_by_year`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `year = year_val`: Selects the year.
        *   `number_of_new_patients = num_new_patients_val`: Selects the count of new patients for that year.
        *   `NPI = num_new_patients_val - PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)`: Calculates the New Patients Increase (NPI).
            *   `PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)` fetches the `num_new_patients_val` from the previous record (previous year, due to sorting and the `by` clause).
            *   `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the series (where there's no preceding year), the previous count is treated as 0. So, for the first year, NPI will be equal to `number_of_new_patients`.",49.25624656677246,"# Step 1: For each patient, find the year of their first treatment.

1.  **Filter Outcomes**: Select only those outcome records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the `DEFAULT_TO(field, sentinel_value) != sentinel_value` pattern to check for non-null values, assuming a `sentinel_value` (e.g., -999) that valid PASI scores will not take.
2.  **Calculate Average Scores**: Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` from these filtered records.
3.  **Apply D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the calculated averages in the provided formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100`.
4.  **Return the Result**: The final output should be a single percentage value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcome_scores`: This line defines a filtered subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It includes only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check is performed using `DEFAULT_TO(field, -999) != -999`, which effectively filters out nulls if -999 is a value that actual PASI scores would not take.
2.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the highest level of the database graph.
    *   `avg_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
3.  The subsequent `.CALCULATE(...)` takes these two average values:
    *   `calculated_d7d100pir = (avg_day100_pasi - avg_day7_pasi) / avg_day7_pasi * 100`: Applies the D7D100PIR formula as defined in the problem description.
4.  The final `.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR = calculated_d7d100pir)` selects this computed D7D100PIR value and names the resulting column `D7D100PIR`. This will produce a table with a single row and a single column containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.",79.44425129890442,"# Step 1: Filter outcome records to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_info`)**:
    *   The query starts by selecting records from the `Treatments` collection.
    *   It filters these treatments to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022, using `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`.
    *   For each filtered treatment, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
        *   `patient_insurance_type`: The insurance type of the patient associated with the treatment (accessed via `patient.ins_type`).
        *   `patient_unique_id`: The ID of the patient (accessed via `patient.patient_id`), which will be used for counting distinct patients.
    *   The `outcome_records` sub-collection (which contains `day100_pasi_score`) for each treatment is implicitly carried forward.

2.  **Group by Insurance Type and Aggregate (`insurance_type_summary`)**:
    *   The `treatments_info` collection is then partitioned by `patient_insurance_type` using `PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=patient_insurance_type)`. This groups all treatments by the insurance type of the patient.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each insurance type), `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `insurance_type`: The name of the insurance type (this is the `patient_insurance_type` by which it was grouped).
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: The average `day100_pasi_score`. This is calculated by `AVG(treatments_info.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`, which takes all `day100_pasi_score` values from all `outcome_records` associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group and computes their average.
        *   `num_distinct_patients`: The number of distinct patients for that insurance type. This is calculated by `NDISTINCT(treatments_info.patient_unique_id)`, counting the unique `patient_unique_id` values within the group.

3.  **Select Top 5 Results (`top_5_insurance_types`)**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_d100.ASC())` is applied to the `insurance_type_summary`.
    *   This selects the top 5 insurance types, sorted by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (lowest average PASI score first).

4.  **Final Assignment (`result`)**:

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those who have at least one outcome assessment. An outcome assessment is recorded in the `Outcomes` collection, which is linked to a `Treatment`. Patients receive `Treatments` (via `treatments_received`), and each `Treatment` can have `outcome_records`.
3.  We can use the `HAS` function to check if a patient's treatments have any associated outcome records: `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1`.
4.  For the filtered patients, select their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.
5.  Since we are selecting these fields from the `Patients` collection (where each patient is already unique), the resulting list will inherently be distinct.

    *   `.outcome_records`: Accesses the list of outcome records associated with each of those treatments.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This condition checks if there is at least one outcome record linked to any of the patient's treatments. Only patients who satisfy this condition are kept.
3.  `.CALCULATE(p_id=patient_id, p_first_name=first_name, p_last_name=last_name)`: For each patient who meets the criteria, this step selects their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Diagnoses` collection. The `HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider diagnoses for which there is at least one treatment leading to an outcome where the `day100_itch_vas` score is recorded (not null).
2.  `CALCULATE(...)`: For each diagnosis that passes the filter:
    *   `diag_name_val=diag_name`: Stores the diagnosis name.
    *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the highest `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function aggregates scores from the `outcome_records` sub-collection, which are linked via `treatments_for`.
    *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None).treatment.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients. This path navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments (`treatments_for`), then to the outcomes of those treatments (`outcome_records`), filters these outcomes to those with a recorded `day100_itch_vas`, then links back from each such outcome to its parent treatment (`.treatment`), then to the patient associated with that treatment (`.patient`), and finally gets the `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique patient IDs. This ensures the patient count is specific to those contributing to the `day100_itch_vas` data for the diagnosis.
3.  `TOP_K(3, by=(max_itch_score_val.DESC(), num_patients_val.DESC()))`: This selects the top 3 diagnoses. They are ordered first by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). If there's a tie in scores, `num_patients_val` (also descending) is used as a tie-breaker.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   The code first defines `date_filter_start` and `date_filter_end` to establish the time window for ""past 6 calendar months"". This is interpreted as the six full calendar months immediately preceding the current month. For instance, if the current date is in July, this period would span from January 1st to June 30th of the same year.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` calculates the start of the month that was six months ago.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the start of the current month, which serves as the exclusive end point for the date range.

2.  **Treatment Filtering and Information Extraction**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Using `CALCULATE`, it derives two new fields for each treatment:
        *   `treatment_actual_start_dt`: Copied from the treatment's `start_dt`.
        *   `doc_specialty_field`: The specialty of the prescribing doctor, obtained by accessing `doctor.speciality`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause then filters these treatments, keeping only those where `treatment_actual_start_dt` falls within the calculated `date_filter_start` (inclusive) and `date_filter_end` (exclusive).

3.  **Aggregation by Specialty**:
    *   The `filtered_treatments_with_info` collection is then processed using `PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty_field))`. This groups the treatments based on the `doc_specialty_field` (the doctor's specialty).
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each specialty), `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The specialty name (from `doc_specialty_field`).
        *   `num_treatments`: The total count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered date range. `COUNT(Treatments)` refers to counting the underlying `Treatments` records that belong to this specific partition group.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with that specialty in the filtered date range. `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)` sums the `tot_drug_amt` from the underlying `Treatments` records in the partition group.

4.  **Top 3 Selection**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_based_aggregation`. This selects the top 3 doctor specialties, ordered by the `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

5.  **Result**:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**: This groups the `Patients` collection by the `ins_type` field. Each group, named `insurance_groups`, will contain patients with the same insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this `CALCULATE` clause operates on each `insurance_groups`.
    *   `ins_type_val=ins_type`: Selects the insurance type for the current group.
    *   `avg_height_cm_val=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: Calculates the average height (in cm) for all patients within the current insurance type group. `Patients.height_cm` here refers to the `height_cm` of patients belonging to that specific `ins_type` group.
    *   `avg_weight_kg_val=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Calculates the average weight (in kg) for all patients within the current insurance type group.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm_val.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 insurance type groups based on the `avg_height_cm_val` calculated in the previous step, in descending order (highest average height first).

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` clause formats the output for the top 3 groups.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  **`num_matching_treatments = COUNT(Treatments.WHERE(...))`**: We want to count the number of `Treatments` that satisfy a set of conditions. The `COUNT` function will tally the treatments returned by the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection. A treatment must meet all the following conditions (combined with `&`):
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment.
        *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Checks if the lowercase diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"". The `%` are wildcards matching any sequence of characters.
    *   **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**:
        *   `drug.fda_appr_dt`: Accesses the FDA approval date of the drug used in the treatment.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if this field is present (not null), indicating the drug is FDA-approved.
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**:
        *   Ensures that the treatment has an `end_dt` (end date) recorded.
    *   **`(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`**:
        *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time 6 months prior to the current moment.
        *   `end_dt >= ...`: Checks if the treatment's end date is on or after this date (i.e., within the last 6 months).
    *   **`(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**:
        *   `DATETIME('now')`: Represents the current date and time.
        *   `end_dt <= ...`: Checks if the treatment's end date is on or before the current moment.

Together, these conditions identify treatments for diagnoses related to 'psoriasis', using FDA-approved drugs, and which concluded in the six-month period leading up to and including today.

**Explanation:**

1.  `first_treatment_details_expr`: This contextless expression defines how to find the first treatment for any given doctor.
    *   `Doctors.prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1)`: Filters these treatments to find the one(s) that rank first when ordered by `start_dt` (ascending). `per=""Doctors""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each doctor's treatments. `allow_ties=False` ensures that if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, only one is ranked as 1 (the choice among ties is database-dependent but consistent).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record due to `RANKING ... == 1` and `allow_ties=False`) into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields. If no treatments exist, or if the filter yields no results, this will be a null record.

    *   This line takes the `selected_treatments` (those that met the criteria from step 1).
    *   `selected_treatments.concomitant_meds` accesses all concomitant medications associated with these filtered treatments. The query now operates on each of these concomitant medications.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output rows. For each concomitant medication:

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To calculate the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages.
5.  Round the final average age to the nearest integer.
6.  The result will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE()` to present it.

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level collection `DermTreatment` because we want a single aggregated result.
2.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Male"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients who are male and have private insurance.
    *   `gender == ""Male""`: Filters for male patients.
    *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Filters for patients with private insurance.
    *   `&`: The logical AND operator combines these two conditions.
4.  `.CALCULATE(current_age=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their age.
    *   `current_age=...`: A new temporary field `current_age` is created.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`: This function calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`).
5.  `.current_age`: This accesses the `current_age` calculated in the previous step, which is then used by the `AVG` function.
6.  `ROUND(..., 0)`: Finally, the calculated average age is rounded to 0 decimal places, effectively converting it to an integer.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we need to calculate two values based on their received transactions:

    *   The total number of distinct successful transactions.
3.  The CPUR is then the ratio of these two values.
4.  We will handle cases where there are no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
5.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

We'll use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
*   The first `CALCULATE` will compute the raw counts for distinct coupons used and distinct successful transactions, aliasing the merchant's name.
*   The second `CALCULATE` will use these computed counts to determine the CPUR and select the merchant's name and the CPUR for the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to prepare the necessary components for the CPUR calculation.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: The merchant's `name` is selected and aliased as `merchant_name_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons_val=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the numerator for CPUR.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"" AND have an associated coupon (checked using `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
        *   `.coupon.cid`: From these filtered transactions, it accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the associated coupons.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `num_distinct_transactions_val=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the denominator for CPUR.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the total number of such successful transactions.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one to compute the final CPUR and select the desired output fields.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: The aliased merchant name is selected for the output.
    *   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_transactions_val > 0, ... , 0.0)`: This is a conditional expression.
            *   If `num_distinct_transactions_val` (the count of successful transactions) is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division: `num_distinct_coupons_val / num_distinct_transactions_val`.
            *   Otherwise (if there are no successful transactions), CPUR is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.

1.  **Enhance Notifications Data**: Start with the `Notifications` collection. For each notification, calculate:
    *   The country of the user who received the notification (`usr_country`).
    *   The start date of the week in which the notification was created (`notification_week_start`). This effectively truncates `created_at` to the week.
    *   A flag (`is_weekend_day`) indicating if the notification was created on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Notifications**:
    *   Keep only notifications for users whose country is either 'US' or 'Canada'.
    *   Further filter these notifications to include only those where `notification_week_start` falls within one of the last three weeks, specifically:
        *   The week starting 1 week before the start of the current week.
        *   The week starting 2 weeks before the start of the current week.
        *   The week starting 3 weeks before the start of the current week.
        This excludes the current week as requested.

3.  **Aggregate Weekly Counts**:
    *   Partition the filtered notifications by `notification_week_start`. This groups all relevant notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   For each weekly group, calculate:
        *   `week_starting_on`: The start date of the week (this is the partition key).

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `notifications_enhanced`: We first process the `Notifications` collection. For each notification, we retrieve the `country` of the associated `user`, calculate the `notification_week_start` by truncating its `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week, and determine if it was sent on an `is_weekend_day` (Saturday or Sunday).
2.  `filtered_notifications_by_country_and_week`: This step filters the enhanced notifications. It keeps only those where the `usr_country` is 'US' or 'Canada'. It then further filters based on `notification_week_start`, ensuring that only notifications from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week are included. `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-N weeks')` is used to dynamically identify these past weeks.
3.  `weekly_notification_counts`: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by `notification_week_start`. For each group (i.e., for each of the three relevant past weeks):
    *   `week_starting_on` is the start date of that week.
    *   `total_notifications_in_week` is the total count of notifications sent to US/Canadian users during that week.
    *   `weekend_notifications_in_week` is the count of those notifications that were sent on a weekend. This is calculated by summing 1 for each weekend notification and 0 otherwise, effectively counting only the weekend ones.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  **Filter Relevant Balances**: First, we filter the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today and 7 days prior. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now'))` to ensure the difference is between 0 and 7 days.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**: The problem defines AMB as ""average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". This means for each user, we need to average their balance entries that fall within the filtered 7-day period. We use `PARTITION` by `user_id` on the filtered balances. Then, for each user's group of balances, we calculate `AVG(UserBalances.balance)` to get their individual AMB for the period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, we take all the per-user AMB values calculated in the previous step and compute their average. This gives the overall ""average AMB for user wallets"". This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `amb_value` field from the collection of per-user AMBs.

The final result is a single value representing this average AMB.

)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: This command iterates through each user in the `Users` collection and calculates new fields for them.
2.  `user_uid=uid, user_username=username`: We select the `uid` and `username` for each user, renaming them to `user_uid` and `user_username` respectively in the output.
3.  `latest_user_balance=DEFAULT_TO(...)`: This calculates the LUB for each user.
    *   `Users.balances`: For the current user, this accesses their list of balance records (from the `UserBalances` collection).
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True) == 1)`:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True)`: This function ranks the balance records for the current user. The ranking is based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (so the latest date gets rank 1). `per=""Users""` ensures that ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances. `allow_ties=True` handles cases where multiple balance records might share the same latest timestamp.
        *   `== 1`: This filters the balance records to keep only those with rank 1 (i.e., the most recent ones).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the `WHERE` clause might technically return a collection (even if it's usually a single item for rank 1), `SINGULAR()` is used to explicitly pick one record. This is necessary to access its fields directly. If there are true ties for the latest `updated_at` timestamp, one of them will be chosen.
    *   `.balance`: From the single, most recent balance record obtained, this accesses its `balance` field.
    *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., None)`: If a user has no balance records, or if the process of finding the latest balance somehow results in no value (e.g., `Users.balances` is empty), the `latest_user_balance` will be set to `None`.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average of Daily Active Users (DAU) for each month in the specified period.
- A **Daily Active User (DAU)** for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from transactions where `sender_type == 0` on that particular day.
- The **PMDAU** for a month is the average of these DAU counts over all days in that month.
- The results are aggregated and presented per month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"").

The calculation involves the following steps:
1.  **Determine Date Range**: Identify the start of the month two months ago and the start of the current month. The transactions considered will be within this range (e.g., if the current month is May, transactions from March 1st up to, but not including, May 1st will be included, covering all of March and April).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that have `sender_type == 0` and fall within the calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Aggregation**: For each relevant transaction, extract:
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-03"") for final monthly grouping.
    *   `day_date`: The date of the transaction, truncated to the start of the day (e.g., ""2023-03-15 00:00:00""), for daily grouping.
    *   `sender_id`: The ID of the sender.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transactions by `year_month_str` and `day_date`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each day), count the number of distinct `sender_id`s. This gives the `dau_count` for that day.
5.  **Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   Group the daily `dau_count`s by `year_month_str`.
    *   For each month, calculate the average of the `dau_count`s. This average is the PMDAU for that month.

1.  **Filter and Calculate Individual Session Durations**:

    *   Filter sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after `2023-06-01T00:00:00` and before `2023-06-08T00:00:00`.
    *   For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We'll name this `calculated_session_duration`.
    *   Ensure `user_id` is carried forward for partitioning.

2.  **Group by User and Aggregate Durations**:
    *   Partition the resulting collection by `user_id`. Let's name the partition group `user_partition_group`.
    *   For each user (each group in the partition), calculate the sum of `calculated_session_duration` from all their sessions in the filtered range. This gives the total session duration per user.

3.  **Order and Select Final Output**:
    *   Order the aggregated results by the total session duration in descending order (longest duration first).
    *   Select the `user_id` and the calculated total duration, renaming them as required by the prompt.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable stores the result of filtering `UserSessions`. It includes only those sessions that started between June 1, 2023 (inclusive) and June 8, 2023 (exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_session_duration` which is the duration of that single session in seconds. The `user_id` is also explicitly selected to be used as a key in the next step.
2.  `user_aggregated_data`: This step takes `sessions_with_duration` and partitions it by `user_id`.
    *   `name=""user_partition_group""` gives a name to the groups within the partition.
    *   `by=(user_id)` specifies that sessions should be grouped based on their `user_id`.
    *   In the subsequent `CALCULATE` clause:
        *   `user_id_key=user_id` selects the partitioning key (the user's ID).
        *   `summed_duration_seconds=SUM(user_partition_group.calculated_session_duration)` calculates the total session time for each user by summing up the `calculated_session_duration` of all sessions belonging to that user within the partition group.
3.  `sorted_user_durations`: The data is then sorted by `summed_duration_seconds` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.
4.  `result`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested by the prompt. The `total_duration` will be an integer value representing seconds.",73.39792513847351,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by date and calculate duration for each session.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: The query starts by accessing the `Users` collection and applies a filter.
    *   **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters users whose `country` is 'US'. The `LOWER()` function ensures the comparison is case-insensitive as requested.
    *   **`& (HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1)`**: This condition further filters the users to include only those who have at least one notification that meets specific criteria.
        *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This inner filter on the `notifications` sub-collection selects notifications that are of `notification_type == 'promotional'` AND have a `status == 'unread'`.
        *   **`HAS(...) == 1`**: This checks if the user has one or more such notifications.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, this step calculates the required output fields for each qualifying user.
    *   **`user_name_val=username`**: Selects the `username` of the user and assigns it to a new field `user_name_val`.
    *   **`num_unread_promo_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`**: This calculates the total number of unread promotional notifications for each user.
        *   **`COUNT(...)`**: This aggregation function counts the notifications.
        *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This is the same filter applied earlier within the `HAS` condition, ensuring we count exactly the type of notifications we're interested in (promotional and unread).

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This will be the first day of the month of the transaction, derived using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will serve as our grouping key for months.
    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `month_as_date_obj`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (our partition key), representing the month.
    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.
5.  Finally, we order the results by `month_as_date_obj` in ascending order to get the counts from the earliest month first.

1.  `Notifications.WHERE(notification_type == 'TRANSACTION')`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection and then filters it to retain only those notifications where the `notification_type` field is equal to `'TRANSACTION'`.

The `name=""users_partitioned_by_id""` assigns a temporary name to these partitioned groups, though it's not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` in this simple case. The effect of partitioning by `user_id` is that we will operate on each distinct `user_id` once.
3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id=user_id)`: Finally, this selects the `user_id` from each partition.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_transactions_with_country = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(sender_user_country_attr = sending_user.country)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0`, indicating the sender is a user.
    *   It then uses `CALCULATE` to add a new attribute `sender_user_country_attr`, which stores the `country` of the `sending_user` associated with each transaction.

2.  `country_level_summary = user_transactions_with_country.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `user_transactions_with_country` collection (which contains user-sent transactions with their sender's country).
    *   It partitions these transactions using `PARTITION(name=""transactions_grouped_by_country"", by=(sender_user_country_attr))`. This groups the transactions by the `sender_user_country_attr`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., for each country):
        *   `country = sender_user_country_attr`:  Selects the country name (which was the partition key).
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within that country group. It refers to the `amount` field of the original `Transactions` records that fall into this partition.
        *   `number_of_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: Counts the number of unique `uid`s of the `sending_user` for transactions within that country group. This gives the number of distinct users who sent transactions from that country.

3.  `top_5_countries_by_total_amount = country_level_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the `country_level_summary` (which has aggregates per country).
    *   It uses `TOP_K` to select the top 5 countries. The `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()` clause ensures the selection is based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

4.  `result = top_5_countries_by_total_amount`:

3.  For this filtered set of merchants, access their associated wallet balances from the `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `MerchantBalances`).
4.  Calculate the median of these `balance` amounts.
5.  The term ""today's"" is interpreted as the median of the current balances at the time of the query, rather than filtering balances updated strictly on the current calendar day. The `MerchantBalances.balance` field is assumed to hold the current wallet balance.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we want to compute a single aggregate value (the median balance).
2.  `todays_median_retail_merchant_balance=...`: This defines the name of the field that will hold our calculated median value.
3.  `MEDIAN(...)`: This aggregation function calculates the median of the numerical values provided to it.
4.  `Merchants.WHERE((status == ""active"") & CONTAINS(category, ""retail""))`:
    *   This part filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == ""active""`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, ""retail"")`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring ""retail"".
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only merchants satisfying both are selected.
5.  `.balances`: After filtering the merchants, `.balances` accesses the `MerchantBalances` records associated with these specific merchants. This will be a collection of balance records.
6.  `.balance`: From these `MerchantBalances` records, `.balance` extracts the actual numerical balance values, resulting in a collection of numbers.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection called `session_durations`.

    *   We calculate `duration_seconds` for each session using the `DATEDIFF` function. `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` computes the difference between the session end time and start time in seconds.

2.  **`average_session_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `session_durations` collection (which now includes `duration_seconds`).
    *   We use `PARTITION` to group the sessions.

        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_by_device.duration_seconds)`: For each `device_type` group, we calculate the average of the `duration_seconds` values. We access the `duration_seconds` from the partitioned data using `sessions_by_device.duration_seconds` (where `sessions_by_device` is the name we gave to our partition).

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we alias their `created_at` field (which represents their signup date) to `user_signup_date`. This makes it easier to reference in subsequent steps.
3.  We then filter these users using a `WHERE` clause. The condition for filtering is that the user must *not* have any notifications whose `created_at` date falls before one year from their `user_signup_date`.
    *   The end of the first year is calculated using `DATETIME(user_signup_date, '+1 year')`.
    *   We check for the absence of such ""early"" notifications using `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(created_at < DATETIME(user_signup_date, '+1 year'))) == 1`. This condition is true if there are no notifications within that first year.
4.  Finally, for the users who meet this criterion, we use `CALCULATE` to select their `username`, `email`, and their signup date (which is `user_signup_date`, now output as `signup_date`).

```python
users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
    user_signup_date = created_at  # Alias the user's creation date (signup date)
