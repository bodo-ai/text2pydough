).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It filters these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions in total. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the number of transactions for each customer, and the `WHERE` clause keeps only those for whom this count is 5 or more.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This operation is performed on the filtered set of customers (those with >= 5 transactions).
    *   `customer_name=name`: It selects the `name` of each customer and assigns it to a new field `customer_name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the success rate for each of these customers.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be a successful transaction.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer. Due to the preceding `WHERE` clause, this count will be at least 5, preventing division by zero.
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted in ascending order based on the `success_rate`. Customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"".

1.  **Augment Transaction Data**: For each transaction, we'll calculate:
    *   `relative_week_num`: An identifier for the week it belongs to, relative to the current week. `1` will represent last week, `2` the week before last, and so on. This is calculated by finding the difference in weeks between the start of the transaction's week and the start of the current week.
    *   `is_weekend_tx`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Relevant Transactions**: We'll filter these augmented transactions to include only those from the last 8 weeks (i.e., `relative_week_num` from 1 to 8).

3.  **Group and Aggregate**: We'll group the filtered transactions by `relative_week_num` and then, for each week:
    *   Identify the week (using `relative_week_num` and also calculating the actual start date of that week for clarity).
    *   Count the total number of transactions.
    *   Count the number of transactions that occurred on a weekend.

4.  **Order Results**: The results will be ordered from the most recent week (last week, `relative_week_num = 1`) to the oldest of the 8 weeks considered (`relative_week_num = 8`).

It's assumed that all transactions in the `Transactions` table are related to stocks, as they have a `ticker_id` linking them to the `Tickers` table.

```python

transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(
    tx_date_time = date_time,  # Store original date_time for later use
    # Calculate how many weeks ago the transaction's week was compared to the current week.

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step processes each transaction from the `Transactions` table.
    *   `tx_date_time = date_time`: Preserves the original `date_time` of the transaction.
    *   `relative_week_num = DATEDIFF(""weeks"", DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week'), DATETIME('now', 'start of week'))`: This calculates an integer representing how many full weeks ago the transaction's week occurred relative to the start of the current week. For example, `0` means the transaction was in the current week, `1` means it was last week, `2` means the week before last, and so on.
    *   `is_weekend_tx = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean flag that is `True` if the transaction's `date_time` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.

2.  **`relevant_transactions = transactions_with_week_info.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the augmented transactions to keep only those where `relative_week_num` is between `1` and `8` (inclusive). This effectively selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.

3.  **`weekly_stock_summary = relevant_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(relative_week_num))`: This groups the `relevant_transactions` based on their `relative_week_num`. Each group will contain all transactions for one specific week out of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = relative_week_num`: This is the numeric identifier for the week (1-8).
        *   `week_start_date = DATETIME(MIN(Transactions.tx_date_time), 'start of week')`: This calculates the actual start date of the respective week by taking the earliest transaction time within that group and truncating it to the start of its week. This provides a more user-friendly representation of the week.
        *   `total_transactions_this_week = COUNT(Transactions)`: This counts the total number of transactions in the current weekly group.
        *   `weekend_transactions_this_week = SUM(IFF(Transactions.is_weekend_tx, 1, 0))`: This counts how many transactions within the current weekly group had the `is_weekend_tx` flag set to `True`. The `IFF` function converts the boolean `is_weekend_tx` to `1` (if true) or `0` (if false), and `SUM` adds these up.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.ASC())`: This sorts the final results by the `week_identifier` in ascending order, so the most recent week (last week, identifier 1) appears first, followed by progressively older weeks up to the 8th week ago.

4.  **`result = weekly_stock_summary`**:
    *   The final result is assigned to the variable `result`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Boundary Definition**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` call on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_internal_start_of_last_week`: This is calculated as the start of the current week minus 7 days, effectively giving the start date of the previous week. For example, if ""now"" is a Wednesday and the week starts on Monday, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` would be the Monday of the current week. Subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`) gives the Monday of the previous week.
        *   `_internal_start_of_this_week`: This is calculated as the start of the current week.
    *   These variables establish the date range for ""last week"" as `[_internal_start_of_last_week, _internal_start_of_this_week)`. The start is inclusive, and the end is exclusive.

2.  **Transaction Filtering and Aggregation**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` call uses the date boundaries defined in the first `CALCULATE`.
    *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")`: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
    *   `.transactions_made`: For these US customers, it accesses their associated transactions.
    *   `.WHERE((date_time >= _internal_start_of_last_week) & (date_time < _internal_start_of_this_week))`: This filters the transactions to include only those where the `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" range defined earlier.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions that meet all the above criteria (US customer, transaction occurred last week).
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(...).amount`: Sums the `amount` field of these filtered transactions.

3.  **Final Output**:
    *   The query returns a single record with two fields: `num_transactions` (the total count of transactions made by US customers last week) and `total_transaction_amount` (the sum of the amounts of these transactions).",41.52239203453064,"result = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause computes three new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`. `transactions_made` is a sub-collection of transactions for each customer.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)`.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` clause takes the result from the first `CALCULATE` (which includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`).
    *   It re-selects these three fields to include them in the final output.
    *   It computes a new field `CR` (Customer Rank):
        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC(), allow_ties=True)`: This uses the `RANKING` window function to assign a rank to each customer based on their `total_transaction_amount`.
            *   `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be in descending order of `total_transaction_amount` (so the customer with the highest amount gets rank 1).
            *   `allow_ties=True`: Ensures that if multiple customers have the same total transaction amount, they will receive the same rank.

The final result `customer_transaction_summary` will be a collection where each record contains the customer's name, their total number of transactions, their total transaction amount, and their rank based on the total transaction amount.",26.56349468231201,"customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_from_2022 = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`:
    This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers whose `join_date` falls within the year 2022.

2.  `country_intermediate_stats = customers_from_2022.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the `customers_from_2022` and partitions them into groups based on their `country`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then operates on each country group.
    *   `output_country_name = country`:  Selects the country name for the group.
    *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(Customers.WHERE((status == ""Active"") & (HAS(transactions_made) == 1)))`:
        For each country group, this counts customers who satisfy two conditions: their `status` is ""Active"", AND they have at least one transaction (checked by `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This forms the numerator for the AR calculation.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1))`:
        For each country group, this counts all customers who have at least one transaction. This forms the denominator for the AR calculation.

3.  `result = country_intermediate_stats.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the intermediate statistics for each country.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Renames `output_country_name` to `country` for the final output.
    *   `AR = IFF(num_total_with_transactions > 0, (num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions, 0.0)`:
        This calculates the Activity Ratio (AR). It multiplies the ratio by `100.0` to express it as a percentage.
        The `IFF` function handles cases where `num_total_with_transactions` is zero (meaning no customers in that country group had transactions) by setting AR to `0.0`, thus preventing division by zero.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_customers` that will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` starts with 'j'. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching for the name.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` ends with 'ez'. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching.
6.  **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two name conditions. A customer satisfies this part if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `state` ends with 'a'. `LOWER()` ensures case-insensitive matching for the state.
8.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name condition (itself a combination of two conditions) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria and the state criteria to be included in the count.
9.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function counts the number of customers that satisfy the combined filter conditions.",8.87791395187378,"filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and create a working version with aliased fields for clarity, including the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), transaction date/time, type, amount, tax, and commission.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions within the specified date range. ""Past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" is interpreted as the period from the start of the calendar month that was one month ago, up to the current date and time. For example, if today is July 15th, this range would be from June 1st to July 15th. This is achieved using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month', 'start of month')` for the start date and `DATETIME('now')` for the end date.
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: Partition the filtered sell transactions by their ticker symbol. This allows us to perform aggregations for each ticker.
4.  **Aggregate Financials per Ticker**: For each ticker group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_sell_amount` by summing the `amount` of sell transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_tax` by summing the `tax` associated with these transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_commission` by summing the `commission` for these transactions.
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values for each ticker, calculate the SPM with the provided formula:
    `SPM = (Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`
    This translates to:
    `SPM = (total_sell_amount - (total_tax + total_commission)) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`
    We will handle cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to 0.0 in such instances.
6.  **Format Output**: Select and return only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM` for each ticker.

1.  **Prepare Daily Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, extract the ticker symbol from the related `ticker` object and format the date into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. Select the close, high, and low prices.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared daily data by ticker symbol and the formatted month. For each group (each ticker-month), calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price. This will result in a new collection where each row represents a specific ticker for a specific month with its aggregated price data.
3.  **Prepare for MoMC Calculation**: Partition the monthly aggregated data from the previous step by ticker symbol. This grouping is necessary so that the `PREV` function can operate correctly within each ticker's data to find the previous month's average closing price.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**:
    *   Access the monthly aggregated data within each ticker's group.
    *   Use the `PREV` window function to get the `average_closing_price` from the previous month for the same ticker. The months will be ordered chronologically.
    *   Calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where there is no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker) or if the previous month's average closing price is zero, in which case MoMC will be `None`.

2.  Group the filtered daily prices by `ticker_id`. This allows us to analyze each stock independently.
3.  For each stock (each `ticker_id` group):
    *   Determine its ticker symbol. Since all daily prices in a group belong to the same ticker, we can use `MIN(DailyPrices.ticker.symbol)` to get the symbol.
    *   Find the maximum `high` price (`max_high_val`) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   Find the minimum `low` price (`min_low_val`) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
4.  Calculate the price change (`change_val`) for each stock as `max_high_val - min_low_val`.
5.  Select the top 3 stocks based on the `change_val` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_join_details`: This first `CALCULATE` statement iterates through all `Customers`. For each customer, it extracts their `_id` (as `c_id`), `name` (as `c_name`), the `YEAR` of their `join_date` (as `c_join_year`), and the `MONTH` of their `join_date` (as `c_join_month`).
2.  `customer_transactions_in_join_month`: This second `CALCULATE` statement operates on the `customer_join_details` collection. For each customer, it counts their `transactions_made`. The `WHERE` clause within the `COUNT` function filters these transactions to include only those where the transaction's `YEAR(date_time)` matches `c_join_year` and `MONTH(date_time)` matches `c_join_month` (the join year/month calculated in the previous step). The result is stored as `num_txns_in_join_mth`. The `c_id` and `c_name` are passed through.
3.  `top_customer_info`: This uses `TOP_K(1, by=num_txns_in_join_mth.DESC())` to find the single customer who has the highest `num_txns_in_join_mth`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
4.  `result`: The final `CALCULATE` statement takes the single record from `top_customer_info` and formats it to match the requested output fields: `_id` (from `c_id`), `name` (from `c_name`), and `number_of_transactions` (from `num_txns_in_join_mth`).",46.233309268951416,"# Step 1: For each customer, calculate their join year and month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Filtering**:
    *   First, a `date_condition` is defined to filter transactions. It selects transactions where the `date_time` is on or after January 1, 2023, and before April 1, 2023. Using `DATETIME(<date_string>, 'start of day')` ensures comparisons are made from the beginning of the respective days. This range inclusively covers all transactions from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(date_condition)` applies this filter to the `Transactions` collection, resulting in `filtered_transactions_by_date`.

2.  **Grouping and Aggregation**:
    *   `filtered_transactions_by_date.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))` groups the filtered transactions based on their `transaction_type`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`:  The transaction type itself.
        *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT` is used on `customer_id` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
        *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG` is used on `shares` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
    *   This step results in `transaction_type_summary`, a collection where each row represents a transaction type with its associated distinct customer count and average shares.

3.  **Selecting Top 3**:
    *   `transaction_type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` takes the `transaction_type_summary` and selects the top 3 records.
    *   The ranking is based on `num_distinct_customers` in descending order (`DESC()`), so transaction types with more distinct customers rank higher.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The final `result` variable holds a collection containing the `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares` for the top 3 transaction types as requested.",35.570499420166016,"# Define the date range condition for filtering transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to derive new fields or select existing ones for each ticker.
    *   **`ticker_symbol=symbol`**: Selects the `symbol` field and renames it to `ticker_symbol` for clarity in the output.
    *   **`number_of_transactions=COUNT(transactions_of)`**: Calculates the total number of transactions associated with each ticker. `transactions_of` is a sub-collection of transactions for each ticker, and `COUNT()` aggregates these.
    *   **`total_amount=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with each ticker. `transactions_of.amount` refers to the `amount` field within each transaction in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.

2.  **`.TOP_K(10, by=total_amount.DESC())`**: This function is applied to the result of the `CALCULATE` operation.

    *   **`by=total_amount.DESC()`**: Sorts the tickers by the `total_amount` (calculated in the previous step) in descending order (`DESC()`), so tickers with the highest total transaction amounts appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_with_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we create two new fields:
    *   `cust_state`: This is derived from `customer.state`, accessing the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
    *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, accessing the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `partitioned_transactions = transactions_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transactions_with_details` collection.
    *   `name=""state_ticker_combinations""`: This assigns a name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(cust_state, tick_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the transactions based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

3.  `result = partitioned_transactions.CALCULATE(...).TOP_K(...)`:
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`: For each group (combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`) created by the `PARTITION` step:

2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate the `country_for_grouping` by accessing `customer.country`.
3.  We then partition these transactions by `country_for_grouping`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `final_country_name`: The name of the country from the partition key.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`vti_prices_in_range = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This line defines a contextless expression named `vti_prices_in_range`.
    *   It starts with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records based on two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This ensures that only records for the ticker symbol 'VTI' are considered. It accesses the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` entity.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters records for the ""past 7 days"".
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` means we include records where the difference is 0 (today), 1 (yesterday), ..., up to 6 (6 days ago). This covers a total span of 7 calendar days.

2.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result using the top-level `Broker` collection (representing the entire graph/database).
    *   `CALCULATE(lowest_daily_close_price_vti_past_7_days=MIN(vti_prices_in_range.close))`:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**:

    *   **`time_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: This calculates the new field `time_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: For each customer, this finds the minimum (i.e., earliest) `date_time` from all their transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection. This effectively gives the date of their first transaction.
        *   `join_date`: This is the date the customer joined, directly available from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in ""days"" between the `join_date` and the date of the first transaction (obtained from `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This selects only transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each successful transaction:
    *   `transaction_year = YEAR(date_time)`: Extracts the year from the `date_time` field.
    *   `transaction_month = MONTH(date_time)`: Extracts the month from the `date_time` field.
    *   `price = price`: Ensures the original `price` field is available for later aggregation.
3.  `.WHERE((transaction_year == 2023) & ISIN(transaction_month, (1, 2, 3)))`: This filters the records to include only those from January (1), February (2), or March (3) of the year 2023, effectively selecting the 1st quarter of 2023. The resulting collection is named `transactions_q1_2023_successful`.
4.  `transactions_q1_2023_successful.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered transactions by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`. Each group is named `monthly_group`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the original `Transactions` items that fall into the current partition.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by year in ascending order, and then by month in ascending order.

This involves calculating the start of the current week, then finding the start date of the 8-week period (8 weeks prior to the current week's start) and the end date of this period (which is the start of the current week, making the period exclusive of the current week). These boundaries are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level graph) context.
2.  **Filter Sales and Access Payments**: We select sales with a `sale_price` greater than $30,000 and then access their associated payments (`Sales.payment`).
3.  **Process Payments**: For each payment, we calculate:
    *   `payment_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the payment occurred.
    *   `is_weekend_day`: A boolean indicating if the payment was made on a Saturday or Sunday.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: We filter these processed payments to include only those whose `payment_week_start` falls within our defined 8-week period.
5.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**: The filtered payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start`. For each week, we calculate:

2.  **Filter by VIN**: Filter the cars where the lowercase `vin_number` contains 'm5' using the `LIKE` operator for partial matching.
3.  **Group by Make and Model**: Partition the filtered cars by their lowercase `make` and `model` to group sales by each unique car model.

In this step, we add new fields `processed_make`, `processed_model`, and `processed_vin`, which are lowercase versions of the original `make`, `model`, and `vin_number` fields. This is done to ensure that filtering and grouping operations are case-insensitive as requested.
*   Next, `filtered_cars_by_vin` selects cars from `cars_data_prepared` where the `processed_vin` (lowercase VIN) contains 'm5'. The `LIKE` operator with `'%m5%'` ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' anywhere in the VIN.
*   Finally, `result` is obtained by partitioning `filtered_cars_by_vin`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(processed_make, processed_model))` groups the cars by unique combinations of their lowercase make and model.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operation is performed for each of these groups.
        *   `make=processed_make` and `model=processed_model` select the lowercase make and model for the output, reflecting the case-insensitive grouping.
        *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)` calculates the total number of sales for all cars within the current (make, model) group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the collection of all sale records associated with the cars in that specific partition group. The `COUNT` function then sums up these sales.",44.917929887771606,"# Step 1: Prepare car data by converting relevant fields to lowercase for case-insensitive operations.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
2.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29` for this. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days. If the sale date is today, the difference is 0. If it was 29 days ago, the difference is 29. Thus, `<= 29` covers a 30-day period including today.
3.  Use a contextless expression `recent_toyota_sales` to store these filtered sales.
4.  Finally, use the `Dealership` (the high-level graph collection) to `CALCULATE` the `COUNT` of these sales (as `number_of_sales`) and the `SUM` of their `sale_price` (as `total_revenue`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation on the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, the specified fields will be computed.

2.  **`first_name = first_name,`**: Selects the `first_name` of the salesperson.
3.  **`last_name = last_name,`**: Selects the `last_name` of the salesperson.

4.  **`total_sales_amount = SUM(sales_made.sale_price),`**: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson.
    *   `sales_made` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each salesperson.
    *   `sale_price` is a field within each `Sale` record.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these sale prices to get the total sum for that salesperson. It's assumed that if a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.

5.  **`number_of_sales = COUNT(sales_made),`**: This counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.
    *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.

6.  **`SR = RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`**: This calculates the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.
    *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank.
    *   `by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC()` specifies that the ranking should be based on the total sales amount (re-calculated here as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` to ensure it's available for the `RANKING` function context), in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank. The default behavior for ties (assigning the same rank) is assumed.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as each record represents a sold car.
2.  For each sale, we'll extract the car's make (`car.make`), model (`car.model`), and the `sale_price`.
3.  Crucially, for each sold car (`Sales.car`), we need to determine its latest inventory status. We access its `inventory_snapshots`, rank them by `snapshot_date` in descending order (specific to each car using `per=""car""`), take the latest one using `SINGULAR()`, and check if its `is_in_inventory` status is `False`. This gives us a flag indicating if the car is no longer in inventory.
4.  Filter these augmented sales records to keep only those where the car is confirmed to be no longer in inventory.
5.  Group these filtered records by car make and model using `PARTITION`.
6.  For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` to find the `highest_sale_price`.

    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards for partial matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains ""ford"" OR its model contains ""mustang"".
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.

Explanation:
1.  `initial_context`: We start by calculating `current_month_start_dt` (e.g., if today is 2023-06-15, this is 2023-06-01) and `six_months_ago_start_dt` (which would be 2022-12-01). These are global values for our query.
2.  `filtered_salespersons`: We select salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023.
3.  `relevant_sales`: We take the sales made by these `filtered_salespersons` and keep only those sales where `sale_date` is on or after `six_months_ago_start_dt` and before `current_month_start_dt`.
4.  `sales_with_month_info`: For each relevant sale, we extract `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month` (numerical year and month) and alias `sale_price` to `sale_price_val` for clarity in aggregation.
5.  `monthly_aggregated_data`: We partition (group) the `sales_with_month_info` by `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month`. For each month-group:
    *   `month`: A string representation like ""YYYY-MM"" is created for display.
    *   `PMSPS`: `COUNT(Sales)` counts the number of sales records in that month's group.
    *   `PMSR`: `SUM(sale_price_val)` sums the sale prices for that month's group.
6.  `final_result`: The aggregated data is ordered chronologically using the numerical `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month`. The final output will contain columns `month`, `PMSPS`, and `PMSR`.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to follow the provided formula: `GPM = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Sales for 2023**: We'll start by accessing the `Sales` collection and filtering for records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **Calculate Total Revenue**: For these 2023 sales, the total revenue is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  **Calculate Total Cost**: For the cars sold in 2023, the total cost is the sum of the `cost` of each car. The cost of the car is accessed via the `car` relationship from a `Sale` record (i.e., `Sales.car.cost`).
4.  **Apply GPM Formula**: Using the calculated total revenue and total cost, we apply the GPM formula. This calculation is done at the `Dealership` level to produce a single GPM value for all relevant sales.
5.  **Structure**: We use a `CALCULATE` clause on the `Dealership` collection to compute `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023`. A subsequent `CALCULATE` clause is used to compute the `gpm_value` based on these intermediate results.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from all sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),
    # Calculate total cost of all cars sold in 2023
    total_cost_for_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the GPM formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100
    # The result will be a single GPM value for the year 2023.
    gpm_value = (total_revenue_for_2023 - total_cost_for_2023) / total_cost_for_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following steps:

1.  It starts at the `Dealership` level, which is the top-level collection.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` clause computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_for_2023`: This is the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records in the `Sales` collection where the year of `sale_date` is 2023.
    *   `total_cost_for_2023`: This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales records in 2023. It accesses the car's cost via `Sales.car.cost`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause uses the `total_revenue_for_2023` and `total_cost_for_2023` values (calculated in the previous step) to compute the `gpm_value` according to the provided formula.
4.  The final result, `gpm_calculation`, will be a collection containing a single row with one column: `gpm_value`, representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",32.975077390670776,"gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as it contains information about sales, including the sale date, sale price, and the car sold.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the associated car has an inventory snapshot indicating it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the exact same date as the sale (`InventorySnapshots.snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`). We use the `HAS` function to check for the existence of such an inventory snapshot for the car linked to the sale.
3.  From these filtered sales, identify the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`. This will give us the single sale record that meets the criteria and has the maximum sale price.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to extract the `make` and `model` of the car (accessed via `Sales.car.make` and `Sales.car.model`) and the `sale_price` from this top sale record.

```python
# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the same day it went out of inventory

This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  `Sales.WHERE(...)`: It starts by filtering the `Sales` collection.
    *   The condition `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1` checks each sale.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots` accesses the inventory history of the car involved in the sale.
    *   The inner `WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date))` filters these snapshots to find entries where the car was marked as out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) and the snapshot date matches the `sale_date` of the current `Sales` record.
    *   If such an inventory snapshot exists, the `HAS` condition is true, and the sale is included.
2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: From the sales that meet the criteria, this selects the single sale record with the highest `sale_price`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=car.make, car_model=car.model, car_sale_price=sale_price)`: For the selected top sale, this extracts the car's make (from `Sales.car.make`), model (from `Sales.car.model`), and the `sale_price` of the sale, assigning them to new field names for clarity.",26.4769446849823,"# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the same day it went out of inventory

2.  Group these records by year and month using `PARTITION`. For each group (each month), calculate the sum of `payment_amount` to get the total payments for that month.
3.  Order these monthly totals chronologically by year and then by month. This ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the previous month's data.
4.  Use the `PREV` window function to retrieve the `total_monthly_payments` from the previous month. We set a `default=0.0` for cases where there is no preceding month in the data (e.g., the very first month in the dataset), ensuring the MoM calculation is `current_month_total - 0.0`.
5.  Calculate the MoM change as `(current_month_total_payments - previous_month_total_payments)`.
6.  Select the final fields: year, month, total payments received for the month, and the calculated MoM change.
7.  The query will list all months that have payment data. If a calendar month has no payments, it will not appear in the results. The MoM calculation correctly handles scenarios where a month has payments, but its immediately preceding calendar month had no payments (and thus is not in the dataset), by using the `default=0.0` for the previous month's total.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_customer_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:

    *   `customer_state_from_sale=customer.state`: For each sale, it retrieves the state of the associated customer. `customer` is a link to the `Customers` collection.
    *   `current_sale_price=sale_price`: It takes the `sale_price` for the current sale.
    *   `customer_identifier=customer_id`: It takes the `customer_id` associated with the sale. This will be used for counting unique customers.

2.  `state_revenue_summary = sales_with_customer_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sales_by_state"", by=(customer_state_from_sale))`: This groups the records from `sales_with_customer_info` based on the `customer_state_from_sale`. Each group (partition) represents a unique state.
    *   `.CALCULATE(state=customer_state_from_sale, ...)`: For each state partition:
        *   `state=customer_state_from_sale`:  The name of the state.
        *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer_identifier)`: Calculates the number of distinct customers within that state by counting the unique `customer_identifier` values from the sales records belonging to that state's partition. `Sales` here refers to the sub-collection of sales records within the current partition.
        *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.current_sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for that state by summing the `current_sale_price` of all sales records within that state's partition.

3.  `top_states_by_revenue = state_revenue_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` and `end_period_date = DATETIME('now')`: These lines define the time window for our analysis. `start_period_date` is set to exactly three months before the current date/time, and `end_period_date` is the current date/time.
2.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  `sales_in_defined_period = sales_made.WHERE((sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date <= end_period_date))`: In the first `CALCULATE`, for each salesperson, we create a temporary sub-collection `sales_in_defined_period`. This sub-collection contains only the sales from `sales_made` where the `sale_date` falls within our defined 3-month window.
4.  The second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `first_name = first_name, last_name = last_name`: We select the salesperson's first and last names.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_defined_period.sale_price)`: We calculate the `total_revenue` for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of all sales in their `sales_in_defined_period` sub-collection. This aligns with the provided definition of revenue.
    *   `total_sales = COUNT(sales_in_defined_period)`: We count the number of sales in `sales_in_defined_period` to get the `total_sales` for each salesperson.
5.  `.WHERE(total_sales > 0)`: This filters out salespersons who had no sales during the specified 3-month period. This ensures that `TOP_K` operates on relevant data and avoids potential issues with zero or null revenues if those salespersons were not filtered.
6.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, we select the top 3 salespersons based on their `total_revenue`, with the highest revenue ranked first.

*   `PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`: We access the `PaymentsMade` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
*   `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This is the first condition, filtering payments made to 'Utility Company'.
*   `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two filter conditions.
*   `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This is the second condition.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)`: This function extracts the name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This function checks if the extracted day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", thus identifying weekend payments.

1.  **Calculate Date Boundaries**: Determine the start and end dates of the ""previous ISO week"". An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday. The ""previous ISO week"" is the full week immediately preceding the current week. We'll use `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` to find the start of the current week, and then adjust by `-7 days` for the start of the previous week and `-1 day` for the end of the previous week. This assumes that the `start of week` configuration in PyDough aligns with Monday, as per ISO 8601 standards.
2.  **Filter Payments**: Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated boundaries of the previous ISO week.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For the filtered payments, we'll create fields to be used as keys for partitioning:
    *   A `payment_day_key` by truncating the `payment_date` to its day component (e.g., using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`).
    *   A `payment_method_key` directly from the `payment_method` field.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: Partition the prepared payment records by `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`. For each resulting group (i.e., for each unique day and payment method combination within the previous week), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.
5.  **Format Output**: The final result will show the specific day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries_calc`: This initial `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` collection determines the `previous_iso_week_start_date` (Monday of the previous week) and `previous_iso_week_end_date` (Sunday of the previous week). This relies on `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` correctly identifying the start of the current week, and assumes it aligns with ISO standards (Monday start).
2.  `payments_in_previous_week_prepared`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated `previous_iso_week_start_date` and `previous_iso_week_end_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` prepares two new fields:
        *   `payment_day_key`: This truncates the `payment_date` to the start of its day, allowing us to group payments by the specific calendar day.
        *   `payment_method_key`: This is simply the `payment_method` and will be used for grouping.
3.  `daily_payments_by_method`: This is the core of the aggregation.
    *   We `PARTITION` the `payments_in_previous_week_prepared` collection. The `by` clause uses `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`, effectively creating groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on these partitions:
        *   `payment_date`: Takes the value of `payment_day_key` for the output.
        *   `payment_method`: Takes the value of `payment_method_key` for the output.
        *   `total_daily_amount`: Calculates the `SUM` of `payment_amount` from the original `PaymentsReceived` collection, but summed only for the records belonging to the current partition (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
4.  `result`: The variable `result` holds the final dataset, where each row represents a unique day and payment method from the previous ISO week, along with the total payment amount received for that combination.",54.24379897117615,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_transformed`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` clause, we derive:
        *   `customer_st`: The state of the customer associated with the sale, accessed via `customer.state`.
        *   `_month_of_sale`: An intermediate field for the month of the sale.
        *   `_first_month_in_quarter_num`: An intermediate field that determines the first month number (1, 4, 7, or 10) of the quarter based on `_month_of_sale`.
        *   `quarter_start_dt_str`: The final string representation of the quarter's start date (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This is constructed using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for correct formatting.

2.  `quarterly_sales_report`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_transformed` data. The partitioning keys are `customer_st` and `quarter_start_dt_str`. This groups sales by unique combinations of customer state and quarter start date.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause on the partitioned data then:
        *   Selects the partitioning keys `customer_st` (as `state_val`) and `quarter_start_dt_str` (as `quarter_val`).
        *   Calculates `total_sales_for_quarter` by summing `Sales.sale_price` for all sales records belonging to each group.

3.  `result`:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` statement is used to select and rename the fields to `customer_state`, `quarter`, and `total_sales` as requested by the problem description.

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by operating on the top-level `Dealership` collection to determine a global value: the latest snapshot date in March 2023.
    *   `MAX(InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).snapshot_date)`: This part filters all `InventorySnapshots` to include only those where the `snapshot_date` falls in March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) of the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). From these filtered snapshots, it selects the maximum `snapshot_date`.
    *   This maximum date is then assigned to a new field `latest_date_in_march_2023`. `latest_snapshot_info` becomes a collection with a single row containing this calculated date.

2.  `result = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).car.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection within the context of `latest_snapshot_info`. This makes the `latest_date_in_march_2023` field available for filtering.
    *   `.WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: This filters the `InventorySnapshots` to keep only those records where:
        *   `snapshot_date` is equal to the `latest_date_in_march_2023` (the latest snapshot date we found for March 2023).

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following operations:

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation for each record in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  `drug_name = drug_name`: Selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection.
3.  `avg_ddd_val = AVG(...)`: This calculates the average DDD for the current drug. The `AVG` function operates on a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's treatments.
4.  `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments associated with the current drug.
5.  `.WHERE((HASNOT(end_dt) == 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`: This filters the treatments:
    *   `HASNOT(end_dt) == 0`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` is not null.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the treatment duration in days is positive, preventing division by zero or non-positive values.
6.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_one_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its DDD. `tot_drug_amt` is divided by the treatment duration in days.
7.  `.ddd_for_one_treatment`: This extracts the calculated `ddd_for_one_treatment` scalar value from the inner `CALCULATE` operation. The `AVG` function then aggregates these scalar values.

If a drug has no treatments that satisfy the `WHERE` clause conditions, the `AVG` function will operate on an empty set, resulting in a `null` value for `avg_ddd_val` for that drug.",38.761905908584595,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

    *   `calc_treatment_month_start_date`: The first day of the month in which the treatment started. This will be used for date-based filtering.
    *   `calc_month_label`: A string representation of the treatment's month and year (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). This will be used for grouping and as the output month identifier.

2.  **Filter for Relevant Period**: We'll define the time window as the last three full months, excluding the current month. Treatments falling within this window will be selected using `calc_treatment_month_start_date`.
    *   The start of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')`.
    *   The end of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (exclusive).

3.  **Group by Month**: The filtered treatments will be partitioned by `calc_month_label`.

4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month group:
    *   `total_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among all treatments in that month.
    *   `biologic_drug_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among treatments in that month where the `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.

5.  **Order Results**: The final results will be ordered by month in descending order (i.e., the most recent of the three months will appear first).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `end_dt_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines a variable `end_dt_exclusive`. It uses the `DATETIME` function to get the current timestamp (`'now'`) and then truncates it to the 'start of month'. This effectively gives us the first moment of the current month, which will serve as the exclusive upper bound for our date filter.
2.  `start_dt_inclusive = DATETIME(end_dt_exclusive, '-6 months')`: This line defines `start_dt_inclusive`. It takes the `end_dt_exclusive` (start of the current month) and subtracts 6 months from it. This gives us the first moment of the month that was 6 months ago, serving as the inclusive lower bound for our date filter.
3.  `alice_treatment_count = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`), which is suitable for producing a single aggregated result.
4.  `num_treatments_last_6_months = COUNT(...)`: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `num_treatments_last_6_months`. Its value will be the count of treatments that meet the specified criteria.
5.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only those patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
6.  `.treatments_received`: From the filtered patients, we access their associated treatments through the `treatments_received` sub-collection.
7.  `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_dt_inclusive) & (start_dt < end_dt_exclusive))`: This filters the treatments further. A treatment is included if its `start_dt` (start date) is on or after `start_dt_inclusive` AND before `end_dt_exclusive`. This ensures we only count treatments within the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.

1.  First, for each doctor, we calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by navigating from the `Doctors` collection to their `prescribed_treatments`, then to the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique `drug_id`s. We also select the doctor's ID and specialty, using intermediate names for clarity and potential renaming.
2.  Next, we partition this collection of doctors (now with their distinct drug counts) by their specialty. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  Finally, for the doctors within each specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed (in descending order, so more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures this ranking is done independently for each specialty. We also format the output fields to match the requested names (`doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs`, `SDRSDR`).

)
```

**Explanation:**

The query is designed to provide a ranked list of doctors based on the diversity of drugs they prescribe, with the ranking performed within each medical specialty.

1.  **`doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `doc_id_val=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID and assigns it to `doc_id_val`.
    *   `speciality_val=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty and assigns it to `speciality_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs_val=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: This calculates the number of unique drugs prescribed by each doctor. It navigates through `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments for the doctor), then to the `drug` for each treatment, and finally to the `drug_id` of that drug. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `drug_id`s. If a doctor has prescribed no drugs, this count will be 0.

2.  **`specialty_partition = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection (where each doctor now has their distinct drug count).
    *   `name=""specialty_group_partition""`: Names the resulting partition structure.
    *   `by=(speciality_val)`: Groups the doctors based on their `speciality_val`. All doctors with the same specialty will be in the same group within this partition.

3.  **`result = specialty_partition.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `specialty_partition.Doctors`: This accesses the individual doctor records within each group of the partition created in the previous step.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id=doc_id_val`: Assigns the doctor's ID to the output field `doc_id`.
        *   `specialty=speciality_val`: Assigns the doctor's specialty to the output field `specialty`. Note the change in spelling from the database field `speciality` to the requested `specialty`.
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs_val`: Assigns the count of distinct drugs to `number_of_distinct_drugs`.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC(), per=""specialty_group_partition"", allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (doctors prescribing more unique drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., Rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_group_partition""`: Crucially, this ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group. A doctor's rank is relative to other doctors in the same specialty.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors within the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each item represents a doctor and includes their `doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs` they prescribed, and their `SDRSDR` rank within that specialty.",74.47344017028809,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.

1.  **`Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This starts by accessing the `Doctors` collection and then filters its records based on the conditions provided in the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `first_name` starts with 'j'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
3.  **`CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `last_name` contains the substring 'son'. `LOWER()` ensures the comparison is case-insensitive.
4.  **`|`**: This is the logical OR operator, combining the two conditions. A doctor will be included if their first name starts with 'j' OR their last name contains 'son'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this selects and renames the required fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  `time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two key date boundaries at the highest level (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `calc_current_month_start`: The first day of the current month (e.g., if today is 2023-07-15, this will be 2023-07-01).
    *   `calc_twelve_months_ago_start`: The first day of the month that was 12 months before `calc_current_month_start` (e.g., 2022-07-01).
2.  `treatments_prepared = time_boundaries.Treatments.CALCULATE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection. For each treatment, we calculate `calc_treatment_month` by truncating its `start_dt` to the first day of its month. This allows for monthly aggregation.
3.  `filtered_treatments_by_date = treatments_prepared.WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments to keep only those whose `calc_treatment_month` falls within our target 12-month period. This period starts from `calc_twelve_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and ends just before `calc_current_month_start` (exclusive), effectively giving us 12 full months prior to the current month.
4.  `monthly_metrics_calc = filtered_treatments_by_date.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `filtered_treatments_by_date` by `calc_treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month.
    *   Within each monthly group, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `report_month`: The month for which the metrics are calculated (this is the `calc_treatment_month` partition key).
        *   `PMPD_val`: Per Month Patient Diagnoses, calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id`s in that month's treatments. This counts how many unique patients received at least one diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
        *   `PMTC_val`: Per Month Treatment Count, calculated as the total count of `Treatments` in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(report_month.ASC())` ensures the results are sorted chronologically.

3.  For this specific drug, access its associated treatments via the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
4.  For each of these treatments, access the `patient` record.

1.  `Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin')`: This part filters the `Drugs` collection to select only the drug(s) named 'Drugalin'. Assuming `drug_name` is unique or we are interested in any drug with this name, this will result in a collection containing 'Drugalin'.
2.  `.CALCULATE(average_patient_weight_kg = AVG(treatments_used_in.patient.weight_kg))`: This part calculates a new field `average_patient_weight_kg`.
    *   `treatments_used_in`: This refers to the list of treatments where the selected drug ('Drugalin') was used.

    *   `.weight_kg`: This accesses the `weight_kg` attribute of each of these patient records.
    *   `AVG(...)`: This aggregation function then calculates the average of all the `weight_kg` values obtained from the patients who were treated with 'Drugalin'.

1.  Identify the relevant `Outcomes` records: We are interested in records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the condition `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` to check for non-null numeric values, as comparisons with `NULL` typically yield `NULL`, and `NULL` in a `WHERE` condition filters out the row.
2.  Calculate Averages: From these filtered outcomes, we need to compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` globally.
3.  Apply the Formula: Use the given formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
4.  Handle Division by Zero: If the average `day7_pasi_score` is zero, the formula would lead to division by zero. In this case, the result should be `null`.

This will be done using a two-stage `CALCULATE`:
-   The first `CALCULATE` computes `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100` from the filtered `Outcomes`.
-   The second `CALCULATE` uses these averages to compute the final `d7d100pir_percentage`.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block is performed on the top-level `DermTreatment` collection.
    *   It computes two aggregate values:
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d7`: This is the average of `day7_pasi_score` from `Outcomes` records. The `Outcomes` are filtered to include only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check `((field > 0) | (field <= 0))` works because if `field` is `NULL`, comparisons like `NULL > 0` result in `NULL`, and `NULL | NULL` is `NULL`, causing the `WHERE` clause to filter out such rows.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: Similarly, this is the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the same set of filtered `Outcomes`.
    *   The result of this stage (`calculation_stage`) is a collection with a single row containing `avg_pasi_score_d7` and `avg_pasi_score_d100`.

2.  The second `CALCULATE` block operates on `calculation_stage`.
    *   It calculates `d7d100pir_percentage` using the averages computed in the previous stage.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `avg_pasi_score_d7` might be zero. If it is zero, `KEEP_IF(0.0, 1==0)` (which evaluates to `null`) is returned to prevent division by zero errors. Otherwise, the D7D100PIR formula `(avg_pasi_score_d100 - avg_pasi_score_d7) / avg_pasi_score_d7 * 100.0` is applied. The `100.0` ensures floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.

The final `result` will be a collection with one row and one column, `d7d100pir_percentage`, containing the overall D7D100PIR value. A negative percentage indicates an improvement (reduction) in PASI score from day 7 to day 100.",83.0681586265564,"# Stage 1: Calculate average PASI scores for day 7 and day 100 from valid outcomes

3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Female"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`**:
    *   We access the `Patients` collection.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to calculate the total number of relevant adverse events.
3.  To do this, we iterate through each `treatment` associated with the drug (`treatments_used_in`).
4.  For each `treatment`, we then iterate through its associated `adverse_events`.
5.  For each `adverse_event`, we check if its `reported_dt` falls within the same month and year as the `start_dt` of its parent `treatment`.
    *   We create a calculated field `is_relevant_ae` for each adverse event, which is 1 if the condition (same month and year) is met, and 0 otherwise. The condition is `(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`. Here, `treatment.start_dt` refers to the start date of the parent treatment of the current adverse event.
6.  We then `SUM` these `is_relevant_ae` values across all adverse events for all treatments associated with a drug. This gives the `count_of_adverse_events` for that drug.
7.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(1, by=count_of_adverse_events.DESC())` to select the drug with the highest count.
8.  The result will include the drug's ID (`drug_id`), name (`drug_name`), and the calculated `count_of_adverse_events`.

This PyDough code snippet performs the following actions:
1.  It iterates over each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, it calculates three fields:
    *   `drug_identifier`: The ID of the drug.
    *   `name_of_drug`: The name of the drug.
    *   `count_of_adverse_events`: This is the sum of adverse events that meet a specific criterion.
        *   It navigates from the drug to its `treatments_used_in`, and then to each treatment's `adverse_events`.
        *   For every adverse event, it calculates `is_relevant_ae`. This field is set to 1 if the adverse event's `reported_dt` occurs in the same calendar month and year as its parent `treatment`'s `start_dt`. Otherwise, it's 0.
        *   The `SUM(...)` function then adds up all these `is_relevant_ae` values (effectively counting the relevant adverse events) for the current drug.

3.  From this filtered list of doctors, select their `loc_state`.
4.  Since we need distinct states, we will partition the result by `loc_state` and then select the state from each partition.

1.  `Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'biologic')) == 1)`:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_info`)**:
    *   The query starts by selecting records from the `Treatments` collection.
    *   It filters these treatments to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022, using `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`.
    *   For each filtered treatment, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
        *   `patient_insurance_type`: The insurance type of the patient associated with the treatment (accessed via `patient.ins_type`).
        *   `patient_unique_id`: The ID of the patient (accessed via `patient.patient_id`), which will be used for counting distinct patients.
    *   The `outcome_records` sub-collection (which contains `day100_pasi_score`) for each treatment is implicitly carried forward.

2.  **Group by Insurance Type and Aggregate (`insurance_type_summary`)**:
    *   The `treatments_info` collection is then partitioned by `patient_insurance_type` using `PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=patient_insurance_type)`. This groups all treatments by the insurance type of the patient.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each insurance type), `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `insurance_type`: The name of the insurance type (this is the `patient_insurance_type` by which it was grouped).
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: The average `day100_pasi_score`. This is calculated by `AVG(treatments_info.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`, which takes all `day100_pasi_score` values from all `outcome_records` associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group and computes their average.
        *   `num_distinct_patients`: The number of distinct patients for that insurance type. This is calculated by `NDISTINCT(treatments_info.patient_unique_id)`, counting the unique `patient_unique_id` values within the group.

3.  **Select Top 5 Results (`top_5_insurance_types`)**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_d100.ASC())` is applied to the `insurance_type_summary`.
    *   This selects the top 5 insurance types, sorted by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (lowest average PASI score first).

**Explanation:**

2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `prescribed_treatments` is a sub-collection within `Doctors` representing all treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` checks if this sub-collection is not empty (i.e., the doctor has prescribed at least one treatment).
    *   `== 1` completes the condition, ensuring we only keep doctors who have prescribed one or more treatments.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_id=doc_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**: This selects the specified fields for the doctors who met the filter criteria.

    *   `first_name=first_name`: Selects the doctor's first name.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients`**: We start with the `Patients` collection, which contains all patient records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1)`**: This filters the patients.
    *   `treatments_received`: This accesses the list of treatments associated with each patient.
    *   `outcome_records`: For each treatment in `treatments_received`, this accesses the list of outcome records.
    *   `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records)`: This function checks if there is at least one outcome record across all treatments for a given patient. It returns `True` (or 1) if outcome assessments exist, and `False` (or 0) otherwise.
    *   `== 1`: This ensures we only keep patients for whom `HAS(...)` is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id = patient_id, first_name = first_name, last_name = last_name)`**: This step selects the specified fields for the patients who met the filter criteria.
    *   `patient_id = patient_id`: Selects the patient's ID.
    *   `first_name = first_name`: Selects the patient's first name.
    *   `last_name = last_name`: Selects the patient's last name.

The query will return a distinct list of patients (each identified by their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`) who have at least one outcome assessment recorded for any of their treatments.

The result should include the diagnosis name, the count of distinct patients, and this maximum itch score.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Calculate Metrics per Diagnosis**:
    *   Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
    *   For each diagnosis, calculate:
        *   `diag_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis.
        *   `max_itch_score_val`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score found in the `outcome_records` linked to the diagnosis through `treatments_for`. The `MAX` aggregation function will be used here.
        *   `num_patients_val`: The number of distinct patients (`patient_id`) who received treatments for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT` on `treatments_for.patient.patient_id`.

2.  **Determine Top 3 Diagnoses**:
    *   Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 3 diagnoses.
    *   The primary sorting criterion for ""top"" will be `max_itch_score_val` in descending order. The phrase ""by maximum itch VAS score ... and number of distinct patients"" is interpreted as primarily sorting by the itch score, with the number of patients being an attribute to display.
    *   `na_pos='last'` is used with `DESC` to ensure that diagnoses with no (null) itch scores are ranked at the bottom.

3.  **Format Output**:
    *   Use a final `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**:
    *   This groups the `Patients` collection by their `ins_type`. Each group, named `insurance_groups` internally for the scope of this partition, will contain all patients belonging to a specific insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`** (first `CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`):
    *   `ins_type_calc=ins_type`: Selects the `ins_type` for each group (which is the partitioning key).
    *   `avg_height_cm_calc=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: Calculates the average `height_cm` for all patients within each `ins_type` group.
    *   `avg_weight_kg_calc=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Calculates the average `weight_kg` for all patients within each `ins_type` group.
    *   The result of this step is a collection where each row represents an insurance type, along with its calculated average height and average weight.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm_calc.DESC())`**:
    *   This selects the top 3 insurance types from the previously calculated collection.
    *   The selection is based on `avg_height_cm_calc` in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning insurance types with the highest average patient height will be ranked first.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`** (second `CALCULATE` after `TOP_K`):
    *   `ins_type=ins_type_calc`: Renames the `ins_type_calc` field to `ins_type` for the final output.
    *   `average_height=avg_height_cm_calc`: Renames `avg_height_cm_calc` to `average_height`.

    *   This line starts with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   It calculates two new fields for each drug:
        *   `num_treatments_val`: The total count of treatments associated with the drug, derived from `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`.
        *   `avg_drug_amount_val`: The average of the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with the drug, derived from `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`.
    *   The original `drug_name` (and other fields from `Drugs`) are implicitly carried forward.

2.  `top_drugs_by_treatment_and_avg_amount = drug_metrics_calc.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments_val.DESC())`: This takes the result from the previous step (`drug_metrics_calc`) and selects the top 5 drugs. The ranking is determined by `num_treatments_val` in descending order (drugs with more treatments come first).
    *   `.CALCULATE(drug_name = drug_name, ...)`: After selecting the top 5 drugs, this final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:
        *   `drug_name`: The original name of the drug.
        *   `number_of_treatments`: The calculated `num_treatments_val`.

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"To determine the number of treatments meeting the specified criteria, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three main conditions:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. This will be checked case-insensitively using `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with wildcards (`%psoriasis%`).
    *   **Drug Condition**: The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We'll infer this by checking if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field in the `Drugs` collection (accessed via `Treatments.drug`) exists and is not null using `HAS()`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The treatment must have an `end_dt` that falls within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). We also ensure `end_dt` exists using `HAS()`.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the top `DermTreatment` level.

```python
# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &  # Drug is FDA-approved (approval date exists)
    (HAS(end_dt) == 1) &  # Treatment has an end date
    (end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) &  # Treatment ended on or after 6 months ago
    (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))  # Treatment ended on or before today
)

# Calculate the total number of such treatments
count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions within the `WHERE` clause must be true for a treatment to be included.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition checks the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with each treatment. `LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name)` converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')` then checks if this lowercase name contains ""psoriasis"" anywhere within it (due to the `%` wildcards).
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition verifies that the `drug` used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function returns true if the field exists and is not null, which we interpret as the drug being FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded before attempting date comparisons.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current moment. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` is on or before the current moment, meaning it has indeed ended.

2.  `count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`: This calculates the total number of treatments present in the `filtered_treatments` collection and assigns this count to a new field named `num_treatments`. The result will be a collection with a single row and a single column containing the desired count.",31.107861757278442,"# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Target Registration Year**:
    *   `current_year_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(target_reg_year_val = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2)`: This line first calculates the year corresponding to ""2 years ago"" by taking the current year (`YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`) and subtracting 2. This value is stored in `target_reg_year_val`.

2.  **Filter Doctors and Identify First Treatment Record**:
    *   `current_year_info.Doctors.WHERE(year_reg == target_reg_year_val)`: This filters the `Doctors` collection to include only those doctors whose `year_reg` matches the `target_reg_year_val` calculated in the previous step.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered set of doctors.
        *   `doc_last_name = last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
        *   `doc_year_reg = year_reg`: Selects the doctor's registration year.
        *   `first_treatment_record = prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1).SINGULAR()`: For each doctor, this finds their first prescribed treatment.
            *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the current doctor.
            *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1`: Ranks these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The ranking is done per doctor (`per=""Doctors""`). `== 1` filters to get the earliest treatment.
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Ensures that the result of the `WHERE` clause (which should be one treatment) is treated as a single record, allowing access to its fields in the next `CALCULATE` step. If a doctor has no treatments, `first_treatment_record` would effectively be null.

3.  **Extract Final Details**:
    *   `result = doctors_with_first_treatment_info.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` step takes the intermediate results and formats the output as requested.
        *   `doctor_last_name = doc_last_name`: Carries over the doctor's last name.
        *   `registration_year = doc_year_reg`: Carries over the doctor's registration year.
        *   `first_treatment_date = first_treatment_record.start_dt`: Extracts the `start_dt` (date) from the `first_treatment_record`.
        *   `first_treatment_id = first_treatment_record.treatment_id`: Extracts the `treatment_id` from the `first_treatment_record`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`selected_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**:

        *   `is_placebo == True`: The treatment must be a placebo.
        *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)) == 1`: The treatment must have at least one associated concomitant medication that started within a specific timeframe relative to the treatment's start.
            *   The inner `WHERE` clause on `concomitant_meds` filters medications whose start date (`concomitant_meds.start_dt`) is between 0 and 14 days (inclusive) after the treatment's start date (`start_dt` from the `Treatments` context). `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start, med_start)` calculates this difference.

2.  **`result = selected_treatments.concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `selected_treatments` (those that met the criteria from step 1).
    *   `selected_treatments.concomitant_meds` accesses all concomitant medications associated with these filtered treatments. The query now operates on each of these concomitant medications.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output rows. For each concomitant medication:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`: Retrieves the `treatment_id` from the parent `Treatment` record (linked via `treatment`).
        *   `treatment_start_date = treatment.start_dt`: Retrieves the `start_dt` of the parent `Treatment`.

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To calculate the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter the patients to include only those whose `gender` is ""male"" and `ins_type` is ""private"".
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This is done by finding the difference in full years between their `date_of_birth` and the current date using `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`.
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this average age.

```python
# Filter patients who are male and have private insurance, then calculate their current age
patients_filtered_with_age = Patients.WHERE(

```
Explanation:

1.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""male"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`: This line filters the `Patients` collection to select only records where the `gender` field is equal to ""male"" AND the `ins_type` field is equal to ""private"".
2.  `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each patient passing the filter, this calculates a new field `current_age_in_years`. The age is determined by the `DATEDIFF` function, which computes the number of full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (obtained via `DATETIME('now')`).
3.  `patients_filtered_with_age`: This intermediate variable holds the collection of filtered patients, each with their calculated `current_age_in_years`.
4.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(avg_patient_age = AVG(patients_filtered_with_age.current_age_in_years))`: This line calculates the final result. It accesses the `DermTreatment` graph (the top-level collection) to compute a single aggregated value.
    *   `AVG(patients_filtered_with_age.current_age_in_years)`: This computes the average of the `current_age_in_years` field from the `patients_filtered_with_age` collection.
    *   `avg_patient_age = ...`: The result of the average calculation is assigned to a new field named `avg_patient_age`.
5.  `average_age_of_patients`: This variable stores the final result, which will be a collection with a single row and a single column `avg_patient_age` containing the calculated average age.",16.727490425109863,"# Filter patients who are male and have private insurance, then calculate their current age

5.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` (stored in `merchant_intermediate_stats`) is then passed to a second `CALCULATE`.
6.  `merchant_name=merchant_name_field`: We select the merchant's name for the final output.

1.  **Enhance Notifications Data**: Start with the `Notifications` collection. For each notification, calculate:
    *   The country of the user who received the notification (`usr_country`).
    *   The start date of the week in which the notification was created (`notification_week_start`). This effectively truncates `created_at` to the week.
    *   A flag (`is_weekend_day`) indicating if the notification was created on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Notifications**:
    *   Keep only notifications for users whose country is either 'US' or 'Canada'.
    *   Further filter these notifications to include only those where `notification_week_start` falls within one of the last three weeks, specifically:
        *   The week starting 1 week before the start of the current week.
        *   The week starting 2 weeks before the start of the current week.
        *   The week starting 3 weeks before the start of the current week.
        This excludes the current week as requested.

3.  **Aggregate Weekly Counts**:
    *   Partition the filtered notifications by `notification_week_start`. This groups all relevant notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   For each weekly group, calculate:
        *   `week_starting_on`: The start date of the week (this is the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications_in_week`: The total count of notifications in that week's group.

**Explanation:**

1.  `notifications_enhanced`: We first process the `Notifications` collection. For each notification, we retrieve the `country` of the associated `user`, calculate the `notification_week_start` by truncating its `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week, and determine if it was sent on an `is_weekend_day` (Saturday or Sunday).
2.  `filtered_notifications_by_country_and_week`: This step filters the enhanced notifications. It keeps only those where the `usr_country` is 'US' or 'Canada'. It then further filters based on `notification_week_start`, ensuring that only notifications from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week are included. `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-N weeks')` is used to dynamically identify these past weeks.
3.  `weekly_notification_counts`: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by `notification_week_start`. For each group (i.e., for each of the three relevant past weeks):
    *   `week_starting_on` is the start date of that week.
    *   `total_notifications_in_week` is the total count of notifications sent to US/Canadian users during that week.
    *   `weekend_notifications_in_week` is the count of those notifications that were sent on a weekend. This is calculated by summing 1 for each weekend notification and 0 otherwise, effectively counting only the weekend ones.

    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `category` is ""retail"". The `LOWER()` function is used on the `category` field to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, matching ""Retail"", ""retail"", ""RETAIL"", etc.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition filters for merchants who have at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS(coupons)` function returns true (or 1 in PyDough's boolean context) if the `coupons` sub-collection for a merchant is not empty.

This is achieved by partitioning the filtered balances by `user_id` and then calculating the average of `balance` for each user group.
3.  **Calculate the Overall Average AMB**: Finally, compute the average of all the per-user AMBs calculated in the previous step. This will give a single value representing the average AMB across all users who had balance updates in the past week.

    *   This line defines an intermediate expression. For each record in the `Users` collection:
    *   It accesses the `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserBalances` records linked to the current user).
    *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"", allow_ties=True)`: This function ranks the balance records for each user.
        *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (most recent first).
        *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures the ranking is performed independently for each user (i.e., partitioned by user).
        *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple balance records share the same latest `updated_at` timestamp, they will all receive rank 1.
    *   `.WHERE(... == 1)`: Filters these ranked balances to keep only those with rank 1 (the latest ones).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which might be a collection of one or more tied latest balances) into a single conceptual record. If there are ties for rank 1, one record will be chosen. This allows direct field access (e.g., `.balance`). If a user has no balances, this expression will effectively be null for that user.

1.  Access the `setting_snapshots` sub-collection from the `Users` collection. This gives us a collection of all setting snapshots across all users, but importantly, maintains the context of which user each snapshot belongs to.
2.  For each snapshot, calculate its rank among all snapshots for the *same user*, based on the `snapshot_date` in descending order. This is done using the `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")` function. The `per=""Users""` argument ensures the ranking is partitioned by each user.
3.  Filter these ranked snapshots to keep only those with a rank of 1, which corresponds to the latest snapshot for each user.
4.  From these latest snapshots, calculate the `user.uid` (to get the user ID) and the `marketing_opt_in` status.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.setting_snapshots`: We start by accessing the `setting_snapshots` linked to each user. This operation effectively flattens the snapshots into a single collection where each snapshot record is implicitly associated with its parent user.
2.  `.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This function is applied to each snapshot. It ranks snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first). The `per=""Users""` clause is crucial: it ensures that the ranking is performed *within* the group of snapshots belonging to each individual user (the ""Users"" ancestor collection).
    *   `== 1`: We filter the results to keep only the snapshots that have a rank of 1, meaning they are the latest snapshot for their respective user.
3.  `latest_snapshots_per_user.CALCULATE(user_id_val=user.uid, opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in)`:
    *   From the collection of latest snapshots (one per user who has snapshots), we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields.
    *   `user_id_val=user.uid`: We retrieve the user's unique identifier by navigating from the snapshot back to its parent user (`user`) and accessing its `uid` field. The result is named `user_id_val`.
    *   `opt_in_status=marketing_opt_in`: We retrieve the `marketing_opt_in` field directly from the snapshot. This field contains the boolean preference. The result is named `opt_in_status`.

This involves summing up the amounts from successfully received transactions for each merchant and then ranking them based on this total revenue.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant**:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we calculate `calculated_revenue`. This is the sum of `amount` from their `transactions_received`.
    *   These transactions are filtered to include only those that are:
        *   Successfully completed (assumed `status == ""COMPLETED""`).
        *   Designated as `receiver_type == 1` (as specified in the prompt, likely indicating the receiver is a merchant).
    *   We also select the merchant's `name` and `category`, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` respectively to avoid potential naming conflicts in subsequent steps.
    *   The prompt mentions ""wallet\_transactions\_daily"", which is not in the provided schema. We assume this refers to the `Transactions` collection, which is linked to `Merchants` via `transactions_received`.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Format Output**:
    *   The result from the first step (`merchant_revenue_details`) is a collection where each record contains a merchant's name, category, and their calculated revenue.
    *   We then perform another `CALCULATE` operation on this collection:
        *   The fields `m_name` and `m_category` are renamed to the final output names `merchant_name` and `category`.
        *   `calculated_revenue` is presented as `revenue_amount`. We use `DEFAULT_TO(calculated_revenue, 0.0)` to ensure that if a merchant has no qualifying transactions (resulting in a NULL sum), their revenue is treated as 0.0. This is important for consistent ranking.
        *   `revenue_rank` is computed using the `RANKING()` window function. It ranks merchants based on their `calculated_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1. `DEFAULT_TO` is used here as well to ensure consistent ranking for zero-revenue merchants.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `revenue_rank` in ascending order for easier readability.

This approach interprets ""MRR"" not as traditional ""Monthly Recurring Revenue"" (which would require monthly data grouping) but as ""Merchant Revenue Rank"" based on the total successfully received transaction amounts, as suggested by the prompt's definition and requested output fields.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average of Daily Active Users (DAU) for each month in the specified period.
- A **Daily Active User (DAU)** for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from transactions where `sender_type == 0` on that particular day.
- The **PMDAU** for a month is the average of these DAU counts over all days in that month.
- The results are aggregated and presented per month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"").

The calculation involves the following steps:
1.  **Determine Date Range**: Identify the start of the month two months ago and the start of the current month. The transactions considered will be within this range (e.g., if the current month is May, transactions from March 1st up to, but not including, May 1st will be included, covering all of March and April).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that have `sender_type == 0` and fall within the calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Aggregation**: For each relevant transaction, extract:
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-03"") for final monthly grouping.
    *   `day_date`: The date of the transaction, truncated to the start of the day (e.g., ""2023-03-15 00:00:00""), for daily grouping.
    *   `sender_id`: The ID of the sender.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transactions by `year_month_str` and `day_date`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each day), count the number of distinct `sender_id`s. This gives the `dau_count` for that day.
5.  **Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   Group the daily `dau_count`s by `year_month_str`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users`: We start by selecting the `Users` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(user_type != 'merchant')`: This filters the users, keeping only those whose `user_type` attribute is not equal to 'merchant'. This ensures we are only considering non-merchant users.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `user_id=uid`: We select the `uid` field from the `Users` collection and rename it to `user_id` in the output.
    *   `total_transaction_count=COUNT(transactions_sent)`: For each user that passes the filter, we count the number of transactions in their `transactions_sent` sub-collection.

1.  Filter the `UserSessions` collection to include only sessions that started on or after `2023-06-01T00:00:00` and before `2023-06-08T00:00:00`.
2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. This calculated duration, along with the `user_id`, will be part of an intermediate collection.
3.  Partition this intermediate collection by `user_id`. For each user (each partition group), calculate the sum of all their individual session durations. This gives the total session duration per user.
4.  The result of the partition will include the `user_id` and their `total_duration`.
5.  Finally, sort these results by `total_duration` in descending order using `ORDER_BY`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `UserSessions` collection. It keeps only those sessions where `session_start_ts` is within the desired range: from `2023-06-01 00:00:00` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `2023-06-08 00:00:00`.
2.  `.CALCULATE(duration_secs = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, this calculates the duration in seconds by subtracting `session_start_ts` from `session_end_ts` using `DATEDIFF`. The result is stored in a new temporary field `duration_secs`. The original `user_id` from `UserSessions` is implicitly carried forward.
3.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration.PARTITION(name=""user_group"", by=(user_id))`: This takes the collection of sessions (each now having a `user_id` and `duration_secs`) and groups them by `user_id`. Each group is internally referred to as `user_group`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id, total_duration = SUM(user_group.duration_secs))`: For each `user_group` (i.e., for each unique `user_id`), this calculates two fields:
    *   `user_id`: This is the `user_id` for the current group.
    *   `total_duration`: This is the sum of `duration_secs` for all sessions belonging to that `user_id` within the `user_group`.
5.  `result = user_total_session_duration.ORDER_BY(total_duration.DESC())`: Finally, this sorts the resulting collection (which contains `user_id` and their `total_duration`) in descending order based on the `total_duration`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection to select only the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is 1.
2.  `.coupons`: This accesses the `coupons` sub-collection associated with the filtered merchant (merchant with ID 1). This gives us a collection of coupons offered by this merchant.
3.  `.CALCULATE(coupon_id=cid, total_transacted_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount))`: This operation is performed on each coupon obtained in the previous step.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we are calculating an aggregate value (total count) across a subset of `UserSessions`.
2.  `tuc_count = COUNT(...)`: This defines a new field `tuc_count` which will hold the total number of user sessions.
3.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `UserSessions` collection and apply a filter.
4.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This function call generates a timestamp representing exactly one month prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function call generates the current timestamp.
    *   The condition filters sessions whose `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to one month ago and less than or equal to the current moment, effectively covering the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"".
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `UserSessions` records that satisfy the `WHERE` clause condition.

1.  **Identify the Previous Month**: We'll use date functions to determine the year and month corresponding to the month immediately preceding the current one.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Select transactions that occurred within this identified previous month.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those of `transaction_type == ""wallet""`.
3.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of these filtered wallet transactions from the previous month.
    *   Count how many of_ these transactions had a `status == ""successful""` (assuming ""successful"" is the status string for successful transactions).
4.  **Calculate STR**: Apply the given formula: `STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions`. We'll express this as a percentage and handle cases where the total number of transactions is zero to avoid division errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date_for_calc = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`: This line calculates the date of the first day of the previous month.
2.  `target_year_for_calc = YEAR(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)` and `target_month_for_calc = MONTH(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)`: These lines extract the year and month from the date calculated in the previous step. These will be used to filter transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: The query starts by accessing the `Users` collection and applies a filter.
    *   **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: This condition filters users whose `country` is 'US'. The `LOWER()` function ensures the comparison is case-insensitive as requested.
    *   **`& (HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1)`**: This condition further filters the users to include only those who have at least one notification that meets specific criteria.
        *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This inner filter on the `notifications` sub-collection selects notifications that are of `notification_type == 'promotional'` AND have a `status == 'unread'`.
        *   **`HAS(...) == 1`**: This checks if the user has one or more such notifications.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, this step calculates the required output fields for each qualifying user.
    *   **`user_name_val=username`**: Selects the `username` of the user and assigns it to a new field `user_name_val`.
    *   **`num_unread_promo_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`**: This calculates the total number of unread promotional notifications for each user.
        *   **`COUNT(...)`**: This aggregation function counts the notifications.
        *   **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This is the same filter applied earlier within the `HAS` condition, ensuring we count exactly the type of notifications we're interested in (promotional and unread).

The final result will be a collection of users from the US who have unread promotional notifications, showing their username and the count of such notifications.",21.57752513885498,"us_users_with_unread_promo_notifications = Users.WHERE(

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This will be the first day of the month of the transaction, derived using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will serve as our grouping key for months.
    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `month_as_date_obj`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (our partition key), representing the month.
    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.
5.  Finally, we order the results by `month_as_date_obj` in ascending order to get the counts from the earliest month first.

3.  `.CALCULATE(user_id)`: Finally, this `CALCULATE` clause is applied to the result of the `PARTITION`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `users_with_qualifying_transactions`: This line filters the `Users` collection. It keeps only those users who have at least one sent transaction (`transactions_sent`) where the `sender_type` is `0`. The `HAS` function checks for the existence of such transactions.
2.  `country_based_aggregation`:
    *   This takes the filtered users and partitions them by their `country` attribute. Each partition (`country_groups`) represents a unique country.
    *   Within the `CALCULATE` clause for each country partition:
        *   `country_name=country`: The country name is selected.
        *   `num_distinct_senders=COUNT(Users.uid)`: This counts the number of unique users (by their `uid`) within the current country partition. Since these users are already filtered to be senders of type 0 transactions, this gives the number of distinct users who sent from that country.
        *   `total_user_sent_amount=SUM(Users.transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0).amount)`: This calculates the sum of transaction amounts. It accesses the `transactions_sent` for all users in the current country partition, filters these transactions again for `sender_type == 0` (to ensure only relevant transactions are summed if a user had other types too), and then sums their `amount`.
3.  `top_5_countries_by_sent_amount`: This line takes the aggregated data per country and selects the top 5 countries based on the `total_user_sent_amount`, ordered in descending order.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` formats the output to match the requested column names: `country`, `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent`, and `total_transaction_amount`.",47.920430421829224,"# Step 1: Filter users who have sent transactions with sender_type = 0.

    *   The `merchant.status` must be ""active"".
    *   The `merchant.category` must contain the substring ""retail"". We'll use `LOWER()` on the category to make the search case-insensitive.
3.  From the filtered `MerchantBalances` records, take the `balance` values.
4.  Calculate the `MEDIAN` of these balance values.
5.  The term ""today's"" balance is interpreted as the current balance stored in the `MerchantBalances.balance` field, assuming this field represents the most up-to-date balance for a merchant.

The final result will be a single value representing this median balance.

*   `MerchantBalances.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting records from the `MerchantBalances` collection and then filter them.
    *   `merchant.status == ""active""`: This condition filters for balances belonging to merchants who are currently 'active'. We access the merchant's status via the `merchant` relationship from `MerchantBalances` to `Merchants`.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), ""retail"")`: This condition filters for balances belonging to merchants whose category contains ""retail"". `LOWER(merchant.category)` converts the merchant's category to lowercase for a case-insensitive search, and `CONTAINS` checks for the presence of ""retail"" as a substring.
*   `.balance`: After filtering `MerchantBalances`, this accesses the `balance` field from the resulting records. The `MEDIAN` function then operates on this set of balance values.",28.929543256759644,"result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

Explanation:
- The first `CALCULATE` method is applied to the `UserSessions` collection. It computes a new field `session_len_seconds` for each session, representing the duration of the session in seconds by finding the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`.
- The `PARTITION` method then groups these sessions based on their `device_type`. Each group is named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.
- The second `CALCULATE` method operates on these partitioned groups.
    - `device_type = device_type`: This selects the `device_type` (which is the key for the partition).
    - `average_duration_seconds = AVG(UserSessions.session_len_seconds)`: This calculates the average of the `session_len_seconds` (computed in the first step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. `UserSessions.session_len_seconds` refers to the `session_len_seconds` field that was conceptually added to each record of `UserSessions` by the initial `CALCULATE` operation.

"Which users did not get a notification within the first year of signing up? Return their usernames, emails and signup dates.","SELECT u.username, u.email, u.created_at FROM users AS u LEFT JOIN notifications AS n ON u.uid = n.user_id AND n.created_at BETWEEN u.created_at AND date(u.created_at, '+1 year') WHERE n.user_id IS NULL;",Ewallet,"To identify users who did not receive a notification within their first year of signing up, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, calculate a timestamp representing the end of their first year. This is done by adding one year to their `created_at` (sign-up) date. We'll alias the necessary fields (`username`, `email`, `created_at`) for clarity and later use.
3.  Filter these users. A user is kept if they have no notifications (`notifications` sub-collection) whose `created_at` date falls before this calculated one-year mark. This is achieved using `HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0`. This condition correctly includes users with no notifications at all, as well as users whose notifications all occurred after their first year.
4.  Finally, select the `username`, `email`, and the original `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`) for the users who meet the criteria.

```python
users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
    # Alias fields from the Users collection for clarity and use in subsequent operations
    user_username = username,
    user_email = email,
    user_signup_date = created_at,
    # Calculate the marker for the end of the user's first year
    end_of_first_year_marker = DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')
).WHERE(
    # Filter users: keep those who have NO notifications (HAS(...) == 0)
    # where the notification's creation date is before the end_of_first_year_marker.
    # This covers users with no notifications at all, or users whose notifications are all after the first year.
    HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0
).CALCULATE(
    # Select the requested fields for the output
    username = user_username,
    email = user_email,
    signup_date = user_signup_date
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We begin by processing the `Users` collection. In this step, we:
    *   Alias `username` to `user_username`, `email` to `user_email`, and `created_at` to `user_signup_date`. This helps in clearly referencing these values later.
    *   Calculate `end_of_first_year_marker`: For each user, this new field stores the timestamp exactly one year after their `created_at` date (sign-up date), using the `DATETIME` function.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0)`: This filters the users based on their notification history.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)`: For each user, this filters their associated `notifications` to include only those created *before* the `end_of_first_year_marker` (i.e., within their first year).
    *   `HAS(...)`: This function checks if the filtered set of notifications (those within the first year) has any records. It returns `1` (True) if there's at least one such notification, and `0` (False) otherwise.
    *   `... == 0`: The overall condition keeps users for whom `HAS(...)` is `0`, meaning they have no notifications that were created within their first year of signing up.

3.  `.CALCULATE(username = user_username, email = user_email, signup_date = user_signup_date)`: For the users who passed the filter, this step selects and formats the final output:
    *   `username`: The user's username.
    *   `email`: The user's email.
    *   `signup_date`: The user's original sign-up date (`created_at`).",37.50725221633911,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
