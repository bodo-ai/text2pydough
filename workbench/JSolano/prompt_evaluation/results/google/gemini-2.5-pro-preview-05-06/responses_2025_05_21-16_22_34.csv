).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer that meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the customer and assigns it to `customer_name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express the rate as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.

The query effectively identifies customers with a minimum transaction volume and then computes and orders them by their transaction success rate.",20.373480081558228,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    a.  Their `email` address must end with "".com"".
    b.  They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are counting records from the filtered `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single number representing this count, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols for clarity and reusability
faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

# Filter customers who meet the specified criteria
# 1. Email ends with "".com""

)

# Calculate the count of these distinct customers at the Broker level

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to understand.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition within the `WHERE` clause. It filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the first condition with the second.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions associated with each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols))`: This filters the transactions, keeping only those where the `ticker.symbol` (the symbol of the stock involved in the transaction) is present in the `faang_ticker_symbols` list. The `ISIN` function checks for membership in the provided tuple.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: The `HAS` function checks if the preceding filtered collection (transactions of FAANG stocks for that customer) contains at least one record. If it does, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this context).
6.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(distinct_faang_customers_count = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result at the `Broker` (top-level) scope.

1.  **Augment Transaction Data**: For each transaction, we'll calculate:
    *   `relative_week_num`: An identifier for the week it belongs to, relative to the current week. `1` will represent last week, `2` the week before last, and so on. This is calculated by finding the difference in weeks between the start of the transaction's week and the start of the current week.
    *   `is_weekend_tx`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Relevant Transactions**: We'll filter these augmented transactions to include only those from the last 8 weeks (i.e., `relative_week_num` from 1 to 8).

3.  **Group and Aggregate**: We'll group the filtered transactions by `relative_week_num` and then, for each week:
    *   Identify the week (using `relative_week_num` and also calculating the actual start date of that week for clarity).
    *   Count the total number of transactions.
    *   Count the number of transactions that occurred on a weekend.

4.  **Order Results**: The results will be ordered from the most recent week (last week, `relative_week_num = 1`) to the oldest of the 8 weeks considered (`relative_week_num = 8`).

It's assumed that all transactions in the `Transactions` table are related to stocks, as they have a `ticker_id` linking them to the `Tickers` table.

```python

transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(
    tx_date_time = date_time,  # Store original date_time for later use
    # Calculate how many weeks ago the transaction's week was compared to the current week.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step processes each transaction from the `Transactions` table.
    *   `tx_date_time = date_time`: Preserves the original `date_time` of the transaction.
    *   `relative_week_num = DATEDIFF(""weeks"", DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week'), DATETIME('now', 'start of week'))`: This calculates an integer representing how many full weeks ago the transaction's week occurred relative to the start of the current week. For example, `0` means the transaction was in the current week, `1` means it was last week, `2` means the week before last, and so on.
    *   `is_weekend_tx = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean flag that is `True` if the transaction's `date_time` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.

2.  **`relevant_transactions = transactions_with_week_info.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the augmented transactions to keep only those where `relative_week_num` is between `1` and `8` (inclusive). This effectively selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.

3.  **`weekly_stock_summary = relevant_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(relative_week_num))`: This groups the `relevant_transactions` based on their `relative_week_num`. Each group will contain all transactions for one specific week out of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = relative_week_num`: This is the numeric identifier for the week (1-8).
        *   `week_start_date = DATETIME(MIN(Transactions.tx_date_time), 'start of week')`: This calculates the actual start date of the respective week by taking the earliest transaction time within that group and truncating it to the start of its week. This provides a more user-friendly representation of the week.
        *   `total_transactions_this_week = COUNT(Transactions)`: This counts the total number of transactions in the current weekly group.
        *   `weekend_transactions_this_week = SUM(IFF(Transactions.is_weekend_tx, 1, 0))`: This counts how many transactions within the current weekly group had the `is_weekend_tx` flag set to `True`. The `IFF` function converts the boolean `is_weekend_tx` to `1` (if true) or `0` (if false), and `SUM` adds these up.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.ASC())`: This sorts the final results by the `week_identifier` in ascending order, so the most recent week (last week, identifier 1) appears first, followed by progressively older weeks up to the 8th week ago.

4.  **`result = weekly_stock_summary`**:
    *   The final result is assigned to the variable `result`. It will contain a table with columns: `week_identifier`, `week_start_date`, `total_transactions_this_week`, and `weekend_transactions_this_week` for each of the last 8 weeks (excluding the current week).",59.36191272735596,"# Step 1: Calculate relative week number and weekend flag for each transaction

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `start_of_current_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: This determines the exact timestamp for the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday at 00:00:00).
    *   `start_of_last_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: This calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week immediately preceding the current week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   `relevant_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: It selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"". This is achieved by navigating from the `Transactions` collection to the linked `Customers` collection via the `customer` field and then accessing the `country` attribute.
    *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week_dt) & (date_time < start_of_current_week_dt)`: This ensures that only transactions whose `date_time` falls within the last week are included. The period starts from `start_of_last_week_dt` (inclusive) and ends just before `start_of_current_week_dt` (exclusive), covering the entire previous week.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates**:
    *   `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: The final aggregation is performed at the `Broker` (top) level, producing a single result row.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(relevant_transactions)`: This counts the number of transactions that met the filtering criteria.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(relevant_transactions.amount)`: This sums the `amount` field of all the filtered transactions to get the total transaction value.",30.189894199371338,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the last week

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name`.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` for each customer).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Select the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`.
        *   Rename `total_trans_amount` to `total_transaction_amount` for the final output.
        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (CR).
            *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank to each customer.
            *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` field in descending order. This means the customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1.

4.  Group these transactions by the `ticker_symbol_val` using `PARTITION`.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), count the number of transactions. This count represents the number of buy transactions for that symbol in the specified period. This is done using `CALCULATE(ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_val, num_buy_transactions = COUNT(Transactions))`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This determines the first moment of the current month.
2.  `start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-6 months')`: This calculates the date 6 months before the start of the current month. For example, if ""now"" is in July, this will be the start of January.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and before `start_of_current_month`. This effectively selects customers from the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.
4.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))`: For these filtered customers, we calculate two new fields: `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`, representing the year and month of their `join_date`.
5.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))`: We group the customers based on the unique combinations of `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`. Each group (`monthly_group`) will contain all customers who signed up in a specific month.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each `monthly_group`:
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val, signup_month=signup_month_val`: We select the year and month for the group.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: We count the number of customers within the current `monthly_group`. `Customers` here refers to the sub-collection of customers belonging to this specific signup month. This gives us the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS).
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the average transaction `amount`. `Customers.transactions_made.amount` accesses all transaction amounts for all customers who signed up in this specific month. The `AVG` function then computes their average, giving us the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT). If customers in a particular month have no transactions, `pmat` will be null for that month.

2.  For these filtered daily prices, we extract the `ticker_type` from the associated `ticker` and the `close` price. These will be named `dp_ticker_type` and `dp_close_price` respectively.
3.  We then `PARTITION` this intermediate collection by `dp_ticker_type`. This groups all the records from the last 7 days by their ticker type.
4.  Finally, for each group (i.e., for each `ticker_type`), we `CALCULATE` the `ticker_type` (which is our partition key) and the `ACP` (Average Closing Price) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `dp_close_price` values within that group.

The AR is defined as:
`AR = (Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

1.  ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" is interpreted as: For a given country, the count of customers who joined in 2022 and have at least one transaction.
2.  ""Total Number of Customers with Transactions"" is interpreted as: For a given country, the total count of customers (regardless of their join year) who have at least one transaction.

The PyDough code will perform the following steps:
1.  For each customer, determine two boolean flags:
    *   `c_is_2022_joiner`: True if the customer joined in the year 2022.
    *   `c_has_tx_flag`: An integer flag (1 if the customer has transactions, 0 otherwise).

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_flags_info`: We first iterate through all `Customers`. For each customer, we calculate:
    *   `c_is_2022_joiner`: A boolean indicating if `YEAR(join_date)` is 2022.
    *   `c_has_tx_flag`: An integer 1 if the customer has any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), and 0 otherwise. This conversion to 0/1 is useful for summing.

2.  `ar_per_country`: We then partition `customer_flags_info` by `country`. For each `country_group`:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country from the partition key.
    *   `num_2022_joiners_with_tx_in_country`: This is the numerator. We sum `Customers.c_has_tx_flag` only if `Customers.c_is_2022_joiner` is true. This effectively counts customers who both joined in 2022 and have transactions within the current country.
    *   `total_customers_with_tx_in_country`: This is the denominator. We sum `Customers.c_has_tx_flag` for all customers in the current country partition. This counts all customers in the country who have transactions, regardless of when they joined.
    *   `calculated_ar`: The Activity Ratio is calculated as `(numerator * 100.0) / denominator`. We use `IFF` to handle cases where the denominator is zero (no customers with transactions in the country), setting AR to 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.

3.  `result`: Finally, we select only the `country` (renamed from `country_name`) and the calculated `AR` (renamed from `calculated_ar`) for the output.",76.73675656318665,"# Step 1: Calculate flags for each customer: if they joined in 2022, and if they have transactions (as a 0/1 flag).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause is used to filter customers based on specific criteria.

2.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with the letter 'j'.

3.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**:
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's `name` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with the substring 'ez'.

4.  **`(STARTSWITH(...) | ENDSWITH(...))`**:
    *   The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions. A customer is selected if their name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez' (case-insensitively).

5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**:
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the customer's `state` to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state ends with the letter 'a'.

6.  **`(...name_condition...) & (...state_condition...)`**:
    *   The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition group with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria.

7.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of customers that remained after applying the `WHERE` clause filters.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters these transactions to include only those where `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   It further filters by `date_time` to include transactions from exactly one month ago up to the current moment, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` for the start and `DATETIME('now')` for the end of the period.
    *   In the same step, it uses `CALCULATE` to create new fields:
        *   `ticker_s`: Extracts the stock symbol from the related `ticker` sub-collection (`ticker.symbol`).
        *   `current_transaction_amount`: Stores the `amount` of the transaction.
        *   `current_tax_plus_commission`: Stores the sum of `tax` and `commission` for the transaction.
    *   The result of this step is a collection named `sell_transactions_last_month`.

2.  **Group Transactions by Ticker Symbol**:
    *   The `sell_transactions_last_month` collection is then partitioned by `ticker_s` (the ticker symbol).
    *   This groups all filtered sell transactions based on their respective ticker symbols. The partition is named `ticker_group_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Data per Ticker**:
    *   Operating on the `grouped_by_ticker` partitions, another `CALCULATE` is used:
        *   `ticker_symbol_output`: The ticker symbol (partition key `ticker_s`) is carried forward.
        *   `total_amount_from_sells`: For each ticker group, this calculates the sum of `current_transaction_amount` from all transactions belonging to that ticker within the filtered set.
        *   `total_tax_and_commission`: Similarly, this calculates the sum of `current_tax_plus_commission` for each ticker group.
    *   The result is stored in `ticker_aggregates`.

4.  **Calculate SPM and Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` step computes the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) for each ticker using the aggregated values:
        *   `ticker_symbol`: Renames `ticker_symbol_output` for the final output.
        *   `spm`: Calculated using the formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_tax_and_commission) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.
        *   To prevent division by zero errors if `total_amount_from_sells` is 0, an `IFF` function is used. If `total_amount_from_sells` is 0, `spm` is set to `0.0`; otherwise, the formula is applied.
    *   The `result` variable holds the final output, containing the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `spm`.",42.38959884643555,"# Step 1: Filter transactions for ""sell"" type and within the last month.

1.  **Prepare Daily Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, extract the ticker symbol from the related `ticker` object and format the date into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. Select the close, high, and low prices.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared daily data by ticker symbol and the formatted month. For each group (each ticker-month), calculate the average closing price, the maximum high price, and the minimum low price. This will result in a new collection where each row represents a specific ticker for a specific month with its aggregated price data.
3.  **Prepare for MoMC Calculation**: Partition the monthly aggregated data from the previous step by ticker symbol. This grouping is necessary so that the `PREV` function can operate correctly within each ticker's data to find the previous month's average closing price.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**:
    *   Access the monthly aggregated data within each ticker's group.
    *   Use the `PREV` window function to get the `average_closing_price` from the previous month for the same ticker. The months will be ordered chronologically.
    *   Calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where there is no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker) or if the previous month's average closing price is zero, in which case MoMC will be `None`.
5.  **Final Selection**: Ensure the final output contains only the requested fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   It renames `date`, `high`, and `low` fields to `price_date`, `price_high`, and `price_low` respectively for clarity or to avoid potential naming conflicts.
    *   Crucially, it fetches the stock symbol (`ticker.symbol`) from the related `Tickers` table and names it `stock_symbol_value`. This performs an implicit join.

2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the records generated in the previous step to include only those where `price_date` falls between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023, inclusive.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""stock_group"", by=(stock_symbol_value))`**:
    *   The filtered records are then partitioned (grouped) by `stock_symbol_value`. This ensures that calculations are done for each distinct stock symbol.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first instance after PARTITION)**:
    *   For each group (i.e., for each distinct stock symbol):
        *   `final_ticker_symbol=stock_symbol_value`: The stock symbol (which is the partition key) is carried forward.
        *   `max_high_in_range=MAX(price_high)`: Calculates the highest price (`price_high`) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
        *   `min_low_in_range=MIN(price_low)`: Calculates the lowest price (`price_low`) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   The `MAX` and `MIN` functions operate on all `price_high` and `price_low` values for the current stock symbol within the specified date range, giving the overall high and low for that period.

5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second instance after PARTITION)**:
    *   This step takes the output from the previous `CALCULATE` (which has one record per stock symbol with its max high and min low).
    *   `price_change_value=max_high_in_range - min_low_in_range`: Calculates the difference between the maximum high and minimum low for each stock, representing the total price change over the period.

6.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=price_change_value.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, this selects the top 3 records (stocks) based on the `price_change_value`, ordered in descending order (highest price change first).
    *   The result will contain `final_ticker_symbol` and `price_change_value` for these top 3 stocks.",78.29612803459167,"result = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_transactions = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The first `CALCULATE` creates new fields for each customer:
        *   `c_id`: Stores the customer's `_id`.
        *   `c_name`: Stores the customer's `name`.
        *   `signup_year`: Extracts the year from the customer's `join_date`.
        *   `signup_month`: Extracts the month from the customer's `join_date`.
    *   The second chained `CALCULATE` then computes:
        *   `num_signup_month_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same year and month as their `join_date`.
            *   It accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which lists all transactions for that customer).
            *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where `YEAR(date_time)` matches `signup_year` and `MONTH(date_time)` matches `signup_month`.
            *   `COUNT(...)` then counts these filtered transactions.

2.  **`highest_transaction_customer = customer_join_transactions.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This takes the `customer_join_transactions` collection (which now includes each customer and their count of transactions in their signup month).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_signup_month_transactions.DESC())` selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `num_signup_month_transactions`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` then formats the output to return only the requested fields:
        *   `_id`: The customer's ID (from the previously calculated `c_id`).
        *   `name`: The customer's name (from `c_name`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions by Date:**
    *   The query starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It uses a `WHERE` clause to select transactions where the `date_time` falls between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, inclusive. This is achieved by checking if the `YEAR` is 2023 and the `MONTH` is between 1 (January) and 3 (March).

2.  **Group by Transaction Type and Calculate Metrics:**
    *   The filtered transactions (`transactions_in_range`) are then partitioned by `transaction_type` using the `PARTITION` function. This creates groups of transactions for each unique type.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`):
        *   `CALCULATE` is used to compute the required metrics:
            *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction (this is the partitioning key).
            *   `number_of_distinct_customers`: Calculated using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`. This counts the unique `customer_id` values among the transactions belonging to the current type and date range.
            *   `average_number_of_shares`: Calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`. This computes the average of the `shares` field for transactions of the current type and date range.

3.  **Select Top 3 Transaction Types:**
    *   The `TOP_K` function is applied to the result of the partitioning and calculation (`grouped_by_transaction_type`).
    *   It selects the top 3 transaction types, ordered in descending order (`DESC()`) based on the `number_of_distinct_customers`.

4.  **Final Result:**
    *   The variable `result` holds the final output, which will contain up to 3 rows, each corresponding to a transaction type, and including the transaction type itself, the count of distinct customers who made that type of transaction in the given period, and the average number of shares for those transactions.",49.07967948913574,"# Filter transactions to include only those within the specified date range:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection. The `CALCULATE` function is used to derive new fields or select existing ones for each ticker.
    *   **`ticker_symbol=symbol`**: Selects the `symbol` field and renames it to `ticker_symbol` for clarity in the output.
    *   **`number_of_transactions=COUNT(transactions_of)`**: Calculates the total number of transactions associated with each ticker. `transactions_of` is a sub-collection of transactions for each ticker, and `COUNT()` aggregates these.
    *   **`total_amount=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with each ticker. `transactions_of.amount` refers to the `amount` field within each transaction in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.

2.  **`.TOP_K(10, by=total_amount.DESC())`**: This function is applied to the result of the `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   **`10`**: Specifies that we want the top 10 records.
    *   **`by=total_amount.DESC()`**: Sorts the tickers by the `total_amount` (calculated in the previous step) in descending order (`DESC()`), so tickers with the highest total transaction amounts appear first.

The final result, `top_tickers_by_transaction_amount`, will be a collection of the top 10 tickers, each with their `ticker_symbol`, `number_of_transactions`, and `total_amount`.",14.558001518249512,"top_tickers_by_transaction_amount = Tickers.CALCULATE(

    *   `tick_type`: This is derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, accessing the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `partitioned_transactions = transactions_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition the `transactions_with_details` collection.
    *   `name=""state_ticker_combinations""`: This assigns a name to the groups created by the partition.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, we calculate three new fields:
        *   `country_of_customer`: Retrieves the country of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.country`).
        *   `transaction_amount_val`: Stores the transaction's `amount`.
        *   `transaction_datetime`: Stores the transaction's `date_time`. This is done to use it in the subsequent `WHERE` clause.

2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now') <= 30)`**:
    *   This filters the transactions, keeping only those that occurred within the last 30 days.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's date/time and the current moment.
    *   The condition `<= 30` ensures we include transactions from today (0 days ago) up to and including 30 days ago.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country_of_customer))`**:
    *   The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by the `country_of_customer`.
    *   Each group, named `country_groups` internally, will contain all transactions from a specific country that occurred in the last 30 days.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each country group created by the `PARTITION` step, we calculate:
        *   `country_name`: This is the `country_of_customer` for the current group.
        *   `num_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`) within the current country group. `Transactions` here refers to the sub-collection of transactions belonging to this specific country after filtering.

1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these prices to include only those for the ticker symbol 'VTI'.
3.  Further filter these prices to include only those from the last 7 days. We can achieve this by calculating the difference in days between the price's `date` and the current date using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` and ensuring this difference is less than or equal to 6 (to cover today and the 6 previous days, making a total of 7 days).
4.  From these filtered prices, find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be calculated at the `Broker` graph level to provide a single aggregated value.

2.  **`Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70)`**:

    *   The `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)` clause filters these customers to include only those who have at least one transaction. `transactions_made` is a sub-collection of transactions for each customer. `HAS(transactions_made) == 1` evaluates to true if the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This function is used to select existing fields or derive new ones.
    *   **`_id=_id`**: We select the customer's original `_id` field.

4.  Use the `TOP_K(1, by=num_matching_transactions.DESC())` function to select the single customer who has the highest count of these transactions.
5.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to format the output, selecting the customer's original `_id` (from `c_id`), `name` (from `c_name`), and renaming `num_matching_transactions` to `number_of_transactions`.

```python
result = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`transactions_for_period`)**:
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those that meet three conditions:
        *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures only successful transactions are considered.
        *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Restricts transactions to the year 2023.
        *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further restricts transactions to the first quarter (January, February, March).
    *   `CALCULATE` is then used to create two new fields:
        *   `transaction_year`: Extracted year from the `date_time` field.
        *   `transaction_month`: Extracted month from the `date_time` field.
        These fields are essential for grouping in the next step. The original `price` field of the `Transactions` collection remains accessible for aggregation.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`monthly_avg_price_data`)**:
    *   The `transactions_for_period` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`. This groups the transactions by each unique combination of year and month.
    *   Following the `PARTITION`, `CALCULATE` is used to compute the desired output for each group:
        *   `year = transaction_year`: Selects the year for the group.
        *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month for the group.
        *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average transaction `price` for all transactions within that specific year-month group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` field of the original `Transactions` records that belong to the current partition.

3.  **Final Selection (`result`)**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` ensures that the output contains precisely the requested columns: `year`, `month`, and the calculated `monthly_average_price` (renamed from `avg_transaction_price` for clarity).

1.  Define a condition to filter sales within the last 30 days. This involves comparing the `sale_date` of each sale with the current date. We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` to represent today's date at midnight, ensuring consistent day-based comparisons. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now', 'start of day'))` calculates the number of full days between the sale date and today.
    *   A sale is within the last 30 days (inclusive of today) if this difference is between 0 (sale happened today) and 29 (sale happened 29 full days ago, making it the 30th day in the window).
2.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  For each salesperson, use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select their `_id` (as `salesperson_id`), `first_name` (as `s_first_name`), and `last_name` (as `s_last_name`).
    *   Count the number of sales in their `sales_made` sub-collection that satisfy the date condition defined in step 1. This count is named `num_sales_last_30_days`.

**Explanation:**

*   The query starts by defining `sales_in_last_30_days_condition`. This is a boolean expression that checks if a `sale_date` falls within the desired 30-day window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` gets the current date at midnight. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now', 'start of day'))` calculates the difference in days. The condition `(>= 0) & (<= 29)` ensures we include sales from today up to 29 days prior, covering a total of 30 days.

**Explanation:**

*   First, we create `cars_data_prepared` from the `Cars` collection. In this step, we add new fields `processed_make`, `processed_model`, and `processed_vin`, which are lowercase versions of the original `make`, `model`, and `vin_number` fields. This is done to ensure that filtering and grouping operations are case-insensitive as requested.
*   Next, `filtered_cars_by_vin` selects cars from `cars_data_prepared` where the `processed_vin` (lowercase VIN) contains 'm5'. The `LIKE` operator with `'%m5%'` ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' anywhere in the VIN.
*   Finally, `result` is obtained by partitioning `filtered_cars_by_vin`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(processed_make, processed_model))` groups the cars by unique combinations of their lowercase make and model.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operation is performed for each of these groups.

If the sale date is today, the difference is 0. If it was 29 days ago, the difference is 29. Thus, `<= 29` covers a 30-day period including today.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate:
    *   `total_sales_amount`: The sum of `sale_price` from their `sales_made`. We use `DEFAULT_TO(SUM(...), 0.0)` to ensure that salespersons with no sales get a total sales amount of 0.0 instead of NULL.
    *   `num_of_sales`: The count of their `sales_made`.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, compute `SR` (Sales Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. The rank is determined by `total_sales_amount` in descending order. We use `DESC(na_pos='last')` to ensure that any NULL or 0 values (though 0 is handled by `DEFAULT_TO`) are ranked at the bottom. The default `allow_ties=False` for `RANKING` will assign unique ranks, breaking ties based on internal row order if `total_sales_amount` is not unique.
4.  The fields selected in the final `CALCULATE` are `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, `num_of_sales`, and `SR`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: The first `CALCULATE` processes each salesperson.
    *   `first_name=first_name`, `last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's first and last names.
    *   `total_sales_amount=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.sale_price), 0.0)`: Calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` of all sales in their `sales_made` sub-collection. If a salesperson has no sales, `SUM` might return NULL, so `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures their total sales amount is 0.0.
    *   `num_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the output of the first one.

    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: Assigns a sales rank (`SR`) to each salesperson. The ranking is based on `total_sales_amount` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that salespersons with 0 sales (or if `DEFAULT_TO` was not used and `SUM` returned NULL) are ranked at the end.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_snapshot_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car_make_calc=Sales.car.make`, `car_model_calc=Sales.car.model`, `sale_price_calc=Sales.sale_price`: These expressions retrieve the make, model, and sale price for the car involved in the current sale. We use `_calc` suffixes to distinguish these calculated fields.
    *   `latest_snapshot_record=Sales.car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1).SINGULAR()`: This is a crucial part. For the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`), it accesses its `inventory_snapshots`. It then filters these snapshots to find the one with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1`. `SINGULAR()` converts the resulting single-item collection into a single record object, representing the latest inventory snapshot. If no snapshots exist or none match the rank, `latest_snapshot_record` might be null or cause an error if not handled, but `HAS` in the next step manages this.

2.  `filtered_sales = sales_with_snapshot_info.WHERE(...)`:
    *   This step filters the records processed in the previous `CALCULATE`.
    *   `(HAS(latest_snapshot_record) == 1)`: This condition ensures that a `latest_snapshot_record` was actually found for the car. If a car has no inventory snapshots, `latest_snapshot_record` would be null, and this condition would filter out such sales.
    *   `(latest_snapshot_record.is_in_inventory == False)`: This condition checks the `is_in_inventory` field of the found `latest_snapshot_record`. It keeps only those sales where the car is confirmed to be no longer in inventory.

3.  `make_model_aggregation = filtered_sales.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""make_model_group"", by=(car_make_calc, car_model_calc))`: The filtered sales records are now grouped (partitioned) by unique combinations of `car_make_calc` and `car_model_calc`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make=car_make_calc, model=car_model_calc, highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales.sale_price_calc))`: For each group (i.e., for each make and model combination):
        *   `make=car_make_calc`, `model=car_model_calc`: The make and model are output.
        *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales.sale_price_calc)`: The maximum `sale_price_calc` among all sales in that group is calculated. This gives the highest sale price for that specific make and model.

4.  `result = make_model_aggregation.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, the aggregated results (one record per make/model with its highest sale price) are sorted in descending order based on the `highest_sale_price`.

    *   The `make` of the car, when converted to lowercase, contains 'ford'. This is checked using `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`.

3.  Additionally, ensure that the car has at least one sale record, so that an average sale price can be calculated. This is checked using `HAS(sale_records) == 1`.
4.  For each car that meets these criteria, calculate its average sale price by taking the average of the `sale_price` from all its `sale_records`.
5.  Finally, select the requested fields: `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, `vin_number`, and the calculated `avg_sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the car's `make` contains the substring 'ford'. The `%` are wildcards for partial matching.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the car's `model` contains 'mustang'.
*   `|`: The OR operator combines the two `LIKE` conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'Ford' OR its model contains 'Mustang'.
*   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one sale record. This is important because we need to calculate an `avg_sale_price`.
*   `&`: The AND operator combines the make/model condition with the sale record existence condition.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields.
    *   `make=make`, `model=model`, `year=year`, `color=color`, `vin_number=vin_number`: These select the respective car details directly.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `AVG()` is an aggregation function that computes the average over these sale prices.",26.382764101028442,"selected_cars_with_avg_price = Cars.WHERE(

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1.  **Define Date Range**: The period of interest is the last six full calendar months prior to the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `six_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month that was six months before the current month.
    *   Sales will be filtered for `sale_date` from `six_months_ago_start_dt` up to (but not including) `current_month_start_dt`.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**: Include salespersons hired in the years 2022 or 2023, inclusive.

3.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales made by these filtered salespersons that fall within the defined date range.

4.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each relevant sale, determine its month (e.g., by truncating `sale_date` to the start of the month). This `sale_month_start_val` will be used for grouping.

5.  **Aggregate Metrics**:
    *   Group the prepared sales data by `sale_month_start_val`.
    *   For each month group:
        *   `PMSPS`: Count the number of sales.
        *   `PMSR`: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales.

6.  **Order Results**: The final results should be ordered by month in ascending order.

7.  **Handling Months with Zero Metrics**: The problem states to ""Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0"". Standard partitioning/grouping in database queries typically only returns groups (months, in this case) that have data. Generating rows for months with no sales activity by the selected salespersons would usually require a calendar table and a left join, or specific functions to generate a series, which are not explicitly detailed in the provided PyDough reference for this kind of scenario. The following query will return all months *that had sales activity* meeting the criteria. Months within the 6-month period with no relevant sales will not appear in the result.

```python
# Define date boundaries for the last 6 full months, excluding the current month
current_month_start_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
# six_months_ago_start_dt will be the start of the first month in our 6-month period

six_months_ago_start_dt = DATETIME(current_month_start_dt, '-6 months')

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `current_month_start_dt` and `six_months_ago_start_dt` define the 6-month period for sales analysis (e.g., if it's July, this covers January to June).
2.  `selected_salespersons` filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those hired in 2022 or 2023.
3.  `relevant_sales_from_selected_persons` accesses the `sales_made` for these salespersons and further filters these sales to include only those occurring within the defined 6-month window.
4.  `sales_data_with_month_start` augments each relevant sale record with `sale_month_start_val`, which is the first day of the month in which the sale occurred. This is used for grouping. The original `sale_price` field is carried over.
5.  `monthly_sales_metrics` performs the main aggregation:
    *   It partitions the `sales_data_with_month_start` by `sale_month_start_val`.

1.  Filter all sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.

3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. The cost for each sale is `car.cost`.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The query will first calculate the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` from the `Sales` collection, filtering by the `sale_date`. Then, it will use these aggregated values to compute the `gpm_2023`.

```
Explanation:
1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  `total_revenue_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: Accesses the sale price for each of these sales.
    *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these sale prices, giving the total revenue for 2023.
3.  `total_cost_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale, it accesses the related car (`.car`) and then its cost (`.cost`).
    *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these costs, giving the total cost of goods sold for 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=IFF(...))`: This second `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`.
5.  `gpm_2023=IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0)`:
    *   This calculates the GPM using the formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
    *   `IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, ...)`: This is a conditional check to prevent division by zero. If `total_cost_2023` is zero, GPM is set to 0 (or you might choose `None` or another indicator depending on business rules for such cases). Otherwise, the GPM is calculated.
    *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point division.

3.  For that `car`, check its `inventory_snapshots`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales.
    *   `HAS(collection) == 1` checks if the sub-collection (derived from `car.inventory_snapshots`) is not empty.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots` accesses the list of inventory snapshots for the car associated with each sale.
    *   The inner `WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))` filters these inventory snapshots to find entries where:
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: The car is marked as out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: The date of this inventory snapshot matches the `sale_date` of the current sale record. The `sale_date` here refers to the `sale_date` of the `Sales` record being evaluated.
    *   So, `sales_on_inventory_out_day` will contain all sales records for cars that went out of inventory on the same day they were sold.

2.  `top_priced_sale = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales from the previous step.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`k=1`) that has the highest `sale_price`. The `DESC()` ensures descending order, so the top one is the highest.

3.  `result = top_priced_sale.CALCULATE(car_make=car.make, car_model=car.model, highest_sale_price=sale_price)`:
    *   This line takes the single top-priced sale record.

The MoM change is defined as the current month's total payments minus the previous month's total payments. The result should include all months that have payment data.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Augment Payment Data**:
    *   The `PaymentsReceived` collection is processed first.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to extract the `payment_year_val` (year of `payment_date`) and `payment_month_val` (month of `payment_date`) for each payment. These will be used for grouping.

2.  **Aggregate Payments by Month**:
    *   The augmented payment data (`payments_info`) is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(payment_year_val, payment_month_val))`. This groups all payments by their year and month.
    *   Within each group (each unique year-month), `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Output the year (`year_out`) and month (`month_out`).
        *   Calculate `total_payments_curr_month` by summing `PaymentsReceived.payment_amount` for all payments belonging to that specific year-month group.
    *   The resulting collection of monthly totals (`monthly_payment_totals`) is then ordered by year and month (`ORDER_BY(year_out.ASC(), month_out.ASC())`). This chronological sorting is essential for the correct operation of the `PREV` function in the next step.

3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    *   The sorted `monthly_payment_totals` collection is processed by another `CALCULATE` clause.
    *   For each month's record, it calculates:
        *   `year`, `month`: The year and month.
        *   `total_payments_for_month`: The total payments for that month (carried over from `total_payments_curr_month`).
        *   `mom_change_value`: This is the core MoM calculation. It's derived by subtracting the previous month's total payments from the current month's total payments.
            *   `PREV(total_payments_curr_month, by=(year_out.ASC(), month_out.ASC()), default=0.0)` is used to fetch the `total_payments_curr_month` from the immediately preceding row in the ordered collection.
            *   The `by=(year_out.ASC(), month_out.ASC())` argument ensures `PREV` respects the chronological order.
            *   `default=0.0` is crucial: for the very first month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), its ""previous month's total payments"" is treated as 0.0. Consequently, its MoM change will be its own total payment amount.

The phrase ""Return all months in your answer, including those where there were no payments"" is interpreted as returning data for all months present in the `PaymentsReceived` collection. If a calendar month has no payments, it will not appear in the result. The MoM calculation correctly handles the first available month and any subsequent months based on the data present.

"What is the TSC in the past 7 days, inclusive of today?TSC = Total Sales Count.","SELECT COUNT(_id) AS TSC FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Dealership,"To calculate the Total Sales Count (TSC) for the past 7 days, inclusive of today, we need to:
1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days (i.e., from 6 days ago up to and including today).
    We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of full days between `sale_date` and the current moment.
    - If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    - If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.
    - If `sale_date` is in the future, the difference will be negative.
    So, the condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` will select sales from today and the preceding 6 days.
3.  Count these filtered sales records.
4.  Assign this count to a field named `TSC`.

    )
)
```
Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because the query asks for a single aggregated value (Total Sales Count).
- `Dealership.Sales` accesses all sales records.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:
    - `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    - `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0)` ensures that we only consider sales that happened on or before today (not in the future).
    - `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)` ensures that the sales happened within the last 6 days from today (e.g., if today is the 7th, this includes sales from the 1st to the 7th).
    - Combining these with `&` gives us sales from the 7-day period ending today.
- `COUNT(...)` then counts the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those salespersons who have at least one sale record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. This is crucial to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  The first `CALCULATE(...)` then computes:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_sales_value=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales made by the salesperson.
    *   `count_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales made by the salesperson.
3.  The second `CALCULATE(...)` builds upon the previous result:
    *   It retains `sp_first_name` and `sp_last_name`.
    *   `calculated_asp=total_sales_value / count_of_sales`: Computes the Average Selling Price (ASP) for each salesperson.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",43.546382427215576,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  Filter this collection to include only salespersons who have a `termination_date` (i.e., they have been fired). We use `HAS(termination_date) == 1` for this.
3.  For these salespersons, calculate their full name by joining `first_name` and `last_name`, get their `phone` number, and calculate the employment duration in days using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`.
4.  Use the `TOP_K(1, by=...)` function to find the single salesperson with the minimum employment duration, sorting in ascending order.
5.  The final result will contain the salesperson's name, phone number, and their employment duration in days.

```python
result = Salespersons.WHERE(

1.  Access the `PaymentsMade` collection.
2.  Filter these payments to include only those where the `vendor_name` is 'Utility Company'.
3.  Further filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). We can achieve this using the `DAYNAME` function to get the name of the day and then check if it is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using the `ISIN` function.
4.  Count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.
5.  The final result will be a single count, so we'll use the `Dealership` high-level collection and `CALCULATE` to present this count.

*   `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `Dealership` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
*   `num_weekend_payments = COUNT(...)`: We define a field `num_weekend_payments` that will hold the count of the filtered payments.
*   `PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`: We access the `PaymentsMade` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
*   `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This is the first condition, filtering payments made to 'Utility Company'.
*   `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two filter conditions.
*   `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This is the second condition.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)`: This function extracts the name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This function checks if the extracted day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", thus identifying weekend payments.
*   The `COUNT` function then counts the number of `PaymentsMade` records that satisfy both conditions.",14.296204328536987,"weekend_payments_to_utility_co = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  **Define the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week runs from Monday to Sunday.
    *   We first determine the start of the current week. Assuming `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week (which is consistent with ISO week conventions).
    *   The previous ISO week's Monday (`prev_week_start_dt`) is then 7 days before the start of the current week.
    *   The previous ISO week's Sunday (`prev_week_end_dt`) is 1 day before the start of the current week.
    *   These dates are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level) collection.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `prev_week_start_dt` and `prev_week_end_dt` (inclusive).

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For each filtered payment, we extract the day part of the `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')` to ensure aggregation is done on a daily basis. This will be `pay_day_key`.
    *   The `payment_method` will be `pay_method_key`.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   The prepared payment data is then partitioned by `pay_day_key` and `pay_method_key`. This creates groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   For each group, we calculate the sum of `payment_amount` using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.

5.  **Output**:
    *   The result will show the payment day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_base_data`: Filters sales to include only those from the year 2023. It then calculates `customer_state_attr` (customer's state), `sale_month_attr` (month of sale), and `sale_year_attr` (year of sale).
2.  `sales_with_quarter_month`: Takes the previous result and calculates `q_start_month_attr`, which is the first month number of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, etc.).
3.  `sales_for_partition`: Constructs `quarter_date_key`, a string representing the first day of the quarter (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This uses `JOIN_STRINGS` to combine the year, the formatted quarter start month (using `LPAD` to ensure two digits), and ""01"" for the day.
4.  `quarterly_sales_by_state`: This is the final step.
    *   It partitions the `sales_for_partition` data using `customer_state_attr` and `quarter_date_key` as grouping keys.
    *   Within each group (a unique combination of state and quarter), it calculates:
        *   `state`: The customer's state.
        *   `quarter_representation`: The string representing the first date of the quarter.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales falling into that specific state and quarter. `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates values from the original `Sales` collection context corresponding to the records in each partition group.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following operations:

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation for each record in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  `drug_name = drug_name`: Selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection.
3.  `avg_ddd_val = AVG(...)`: This calculates the average DDD for the current drug. The `AVG` function operates on a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's treatments.
4.  `treatments_used_in`: Accesses the list of treatments associated with the current drug.
5.  `.WHERE((HASNOT(end_dt) == 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`: This filters the treatments:
    *   `HASNOT(end_dt) == 0`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` is not null.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the treatment duration in days is positive, preventing division by zero or non-positive values.
6.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_one_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its DDD. `tot_drug_amt` is divided by the treatment duration in days.
7.  `.ddd_for_one_treatment`: This extracts the calculated `ddd_for_one_treatment` scalar value from the inner `CALCULATE` operation. The `AVG` function then aggregates these scalar values.

If a drug has no treatments that satisfy the `WHERE` clause conditions, the `AVG` function will operate on an empty set, resulting in a `null` value for `avg_ddd_val` for that drug.",41.18215250968933,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Augment Treatment Data**: For each treatment, we calculate:
    *   `p_id`: The `patient_id`.
    *   `d_type`: The `drug_type` from the associated drug (e.g., 'biologic').
    *   `treatment_month_start`: The first day of the month in which the treatment started. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `month_offset_from_current`: The number of full months between the treatment's start month and the start of the current month. A value of 1 means last month, 2 means the month before last, and so on.

2.  **Filter Relevant Treatments**: We filter these augmented treatments to include only those that occurred in the last three full months, i.e., where `month_offset_from_current` is 1, 2, or 3.

3.  **Partition by Month**: The filtered treatments are then partitioned by `treatment_month_start`. This creates groups of treatments for each of the three relevant months.

4.  **Calculate Monthly Statistics**: For each monthly partition:
    *   We format the `treatment_month_start` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for the `month` output.
    *   `patient_count`: We count the number of distinct patient IDs (`p_id`) within that month's treatments.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: We first filter the treatments within the month to include only those where `d_type` is 'biologic', and then count the number of distinct patient IDs (`p_id`) from this subset.

5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in descending order, showing the most recent of the three months first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, preparing to compute a single aggregated value.
2.  **`count_of_patients = COUNT(...)`**: This defines the field we want to compute, `count_of_patients`. Its value will be the count of patients who meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`DermTreatment.Patients.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `Patients` collection and filters it. Only patients who satisfy the condition inside the `WHERE` clause will be considered for the count.
4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition for each patient.
    *   `treatments_received`: This accesses the list of treatments associated with each patient.
    *   `.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))`: This filters the `treatments_received` for each patient. It keeps only those treatments where:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris'`: The name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
        *   `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`: The type of the drug used in the treatment is 'biologic'.
        *   The `&` operator ensures both conditions must be true for a treatment to be selected.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the filtered list of `treatments_received` (i.e., treatments matching both diagnosis and drug type criteria) is not empty for the current patient. If a patient has at least one such treatment, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1).

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_val = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-6 months')`: This line defines the beginning of our 6-month window. It first gets the start of the current month (e.g., if today is July 15th, it gets July 1st) and then subtracts 6 months, resulting in the start of the month 6 months ago (e.g., January 1st).
2.  `end_date_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines the end of our window (exclusive). It's the start of the current month (e.g., July 1st). Treatments must have a `start_dt` *before* this date.
3.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We use the top-level collection `DermTreatment` to perform a global calculation, resulting in a single output row.
4.  `num_treatments_for_alice = COUNT(...)`: This calculates the desired count and assigns it to the field `num_treatments_for_alice`.
5.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
6.  `.treatments_received`: From the filtered ""Alice"" patient(s), this accesses their associated treatments.

    *   Greater than or equal to `start_date_val` (on or after the first day of the month 6 months ago).
    *   Less than `end_date_val` (before the first day of the current month).

4.  Within each specialty group (partition), rank the doctors based on the `num_distinct_drugs` they prescribed. The ranking (`SDRSDR`) will be in descending order of `num_distinct_drugs` (more drugs means a better rank, e.g., rank 1). We will allow ties in ranking, meaning doctors with the same number of distinct drugs in the same specialty will receive the same rank.
5.  Finally, select the requested fields: `doc_id`, `specialty`, the calculated `number_of_distinct_drugs_prescribed`, and the `SDRSDR` rank.

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   It calculates three new fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id_val`: Stores the doctor's original `doc_id`.
        *   `speciality_val`: Stores the doctor's original `speciality`.
        *   `num_distinct_drugs`: Calculates the count of unique drugs prescribed by the doctor. It navigates from `Doctors` to `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments for that doctor), then to `drug` (the drug used in each treatment), and finally counts the distinct `drug_id`s.

2.  `result = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...).Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(speciality_val))`: This partitions the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection into groups based on the `speciality_val`. Each group (partition) is named `specialty_group` and contains all doctors from `doctors_with_drug_counts` that share the same specialty.
    *   `.Doctors`: After partitioning, this accesses the individual doctor records (which originated from the `Doctors` collection and were processed into `doctors_with_drug_counts`) within each `specialty_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each doctor within their specialty partition, this calculates the final output fields:
        *   `doc_id = doc_id_val`: Selects the doctor's ID.
        *   `specialty = speciality_val`: Selects the doctor's specialty.
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs_prescribed = num_distinct_drugs`: Selects the previously calculated count of distinct drugs.
        *   `SDRSDR = RANKING(...)`: Calculates the doctor's rank (`SDRSDR`) within their specialty.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the `num_distinct_drugs`, in descending order (so, a higher number of drugs results in a lower rank number, e.g., rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_group""`: Specifies that the ranking should be performed independently for each `specialty_group` (i.e., within each specialty).
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors in the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.",62.86995840072632,"# Step 1: Calculate initial information for each doctor, including the number of distinct drugs prescribed.

**Explanation:**

1.  `time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two key date boundaries at the highest level (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `calc_current_month_start`: The first day of the current month (e.g., if today is 2023-07-15, this will be 2023-07-01).
    *   `calc_twelve_months_ago_start`: The first day of the month that was 12 months before `calc_current_month_start` (e.g., 2022-07-01).
2.  `treatments_prepared = time_boundaries.Treatments.CALCULATE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection. For each treatment, we calculate `calc_treatment_month` by truncating its `start_dt` to the first day of its month. This allows for monthly aggregation.
3.  `filtered_treatments_by_date = treatments_prepared.WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments to keep only those whose `calc_treatment_month` falls within our target 12-month period. This period starts from `calc_twelve_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and ends just before `calc_current_month_start` (exclusive), effectively giving us 12 full months prior to the current month.
4.  `monthly_metrics_calc = filtered_treatments_by_date.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `filtered_treatments_by_date` by `calc_treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month.
    *   Within each monthly group, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `report_month`: The month for which the metrics are calculated (this is the `calc_treatment_month` partition key).
        *   `PMPD_val`: Per Month Patient Diagnoses, calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id`s in that month's treatments. This counts how many unique patients received at least one diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
        *   `PMTC_val`: Per Month Treatment Count, calculated as the total count of `Treatments` in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(report_month.ASC())` ensures the results are sorted chronologically.

1.  **Filter Outcomes**: Select only those outcome records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the `DEFAULT_TO(field, sentinel_value) != sentinel_value` pattern to check for non-null values, assuming a `sentinel_value` (e.g., -999) that valid PASI scores will not take.
2.  **Calculate Average Scores**: Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` from these filtered records.
3.  **Apply D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the calculated averages in the provided formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcome_scores`: This line defines a filtered subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It includes only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check is performed using `DEFAULT_TO(field, -999) != -999`, which effectively filters out nulls if -999 is a value that actual PASI scores would not take.
2.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the highest level of the database graph.
    *   `avg_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
3.  The subsequent `.CALCULATE(...)` takes these two average values:
    *   `calculated_d7d100pir = (avg_day100_pasi - avg_day7_pasi) / avg_day7_pasi * 100`: Applies the D7D100PIR formula as defined in the problem description.
4.  The final `.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR = calculated_d7d100pir)` selects this computed D7D100PIR value and names the resulting column `D7D100PIR`. This will produce a table with a single row and a single column containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.",80.76552057266235,"# Step 1: Filter outcome records to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have at least one prescribed treatment (`prescribed_treatments`) where the associated drug (`drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'. The `HAS` function is used to check for the existence of such treatments.
3.  Group the filtered doctors by their location state (`loc_state`) using the `PARTITION` method. This ensures that we process each state only once.
4.  Use the `CALCULATE` method to output the distinct state names.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first filters the `Doctors` collection. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HAS` function to check if a doctor has any `prescribed_treatments` that satisfy the condition `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`. This condition navigates from a treatment to its associated drug and checks the drug's type.

Once the relevant doctors are identified, the `PARTITION` method is used. It groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. The `name=""unique_doctor_states""` argument names these groups.

Finally, `CALCULATE(state_name=loc_state)` is applied to the result of the partition. Since `PARTITION` creates groups based on unique `loc_state` values, this `CALCULATE` effectively produces a list of distinct states, renaming `loc_state` to `state_name` in the output.",25.03213095664978,"# Filter doctors to find those who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those who have at least one treatment (`treatments_received`) which, in turn, has at least one outcome assessment (`outcome_records`). The `HAS()` function is suitable for checking this existence.
3.  For the filtered patients, select their `patient_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.

The resulting list of patients will inherently be distinct because we are selecting attributes from the `Patients` collection after applying the filter.

patients_with_outcomes = Patients.WHERE(
    HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1
).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Patients`: We begin by accessing the `Patients` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1)`: This filters the patients.
    *   `treatments_received`: Accesses the list of treatments each patient has received.
    *   `.outcome_records`: For each of those treatments, it accesses the list of outcome records.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one outcome record associated with any of the patient's treatments. Only patients meeting this condition are kept.
3.  `.CALCULATE(pat_id=patient_id, pat_first_name=first_name, pat_last_name=last_name)`: This selects the required fields for the patients who passed the filter.
    *   `pat_id=patient_id`: Selects the `patient_id` and renames it to `pat_id`.
    *   `pat_first_name=first_name`: Selects the `first_name` and renames it to `pat_first_name`.
    *   `pat_last_name=last_name`: Selects the `last_name` and renames it to `pat_last_name`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection, which contains all drug records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_used_in) == 1)`**: This filters the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection of `Drugs` that lists all treatments in which a particular drug was used.

    *   `== 1` (which is equivalent to `is True`) ensures we only keep drugs for which `treatments_used_in` is empty, meaning the drug has not been used in any treatments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.WHERE(HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Patients` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these patients.
    *   `HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1` checks if the `treatments_received` sub-collection for each patient is empty. `treatments_received` is a list of treatments associated with a patient.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**:

    c.  `num_patients_val`: The number of distinct patients who have a recorded `day100_itch_vas` score for treatments associated with this diagnosis. This ensures the patient count is relevant to the itch score context.
4.  Use `TOP_K(3, ...)` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking will be primarily by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order, and secondarily by `num_patients_val` in descending order (to resolve ties in itch score).

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Diagnoses` collection. The `HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider diagnoses for which there is at least one treatment leading to an outcome where the `day100_itch_vas` score is recorded (not null).
2.  `CALCULATE(...)`: For each diagnosis that passes the filter:
    *   `diag_name_val=diag_name`: Stores the diagnosis name.
    *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the highest `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function aggregates scores from the `outcome_records` sub-collection, which are linked via `treatments_for`.
    *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None).treatment.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients. This path navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments (`treatments_for`), then to the outcomes of those treatments (`outcome_records`), filters these outcomes to those with a recorded `day100_itch_vas`, then links back from each such outcome to its parent treatment (`.treatment`), then to the patient associated with that treatment (`.patient`), and finally gets the `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique patient IDs. This ensures the patient count is specific to those contributing to the `day100_itch_vas` data for the diagnosis.
3.  `TOP_K(3, by=(max_itch_score_val.DESC(), num_patients_val.DESC()))`: This selects the top 3 diagnoses. They are ordered first by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). If there's a tie in scores, `num_patients_val` (also descending) is used as a tie-breaker.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   `start_date_limit = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-5 months')`: This calculates the first day of the calendar month that was 5 months before the current month. For instance, if the current month is July, this will be February 1st.
    *   `end_date_limit = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '+1 month')`: This calculates the first day of the calendar month immediately following the current month. For instance, if the current month is July, this will be August 1st.
    *   The treatments will be filtered for `start_dt` between `start_date_limit` (inclusive) and `end_date_limit` (exclusive), effectively covering the last 6 full calendar months including the current one.

2.  **Initial Data Preparation (`filtered_treatments_with_specialty`)**:
    *   The query starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE(doc_specialty_field = doctor.speciality)`: It first accesses the related `doctor` for each treatment and retrieves their `speciality`, storing it in a new field `doc_specialty_field`. This is necessary because `PARTITION` requires its `by` keys to be direct fields of the collection being partitioned.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_date_limit) & (start_dt < end_date_limit))`: It then filters these treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated 6-month window.

3.  **Partitioning by Specialty (`partitioned_by_specialty`)**:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty_field))`: The filtered treatments are grouped (partitioned) by the `doc_specialty_field`. Each group, named `specialty_group`, contains all treatments prescribed by doctors of a particular specialty within the specified timeframe.

4.  **Aggregation per Specialty (`specialty_aggregates`)**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each specialty group created by the partition:
        *   `specialty = doc_specialty_field`: The specialty name is taken directly from the partition key.
        *   `num_treatments = COUNT(Treatments)`: The total number of treatments within that specialty group is counted. `Treatments` here refers to the records from the original `Treatments` collection that fall into the current partition group.
        *   `total_drug_amount = SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: The total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) for all treatments within that specialty group is summed up.

5.  **Selecting Top 3 (`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`)**:
    *   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())`: From the aggregated results per specialty, this selects the top 3 specialties based on the `total_drug_amount`, ordered in descending order.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:

        *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that specific `ins_type` group. We refer back to `Patients.height_cm` because `AVG` needs to operate on the collection of patients belonging to the current partition.
        *   `avg_weight_kg=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Similarly, we calculate the average `weight_kg` for patients within that `ins_type` group.

3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 5 drugs. The phrase ""top 5 drugs by number of treatments and average drug amount"" is interpreted as primarily ranking by the number of treatments in descending order. The average drug amount will also be reported for these top 5 drugs.
4.  The final result will include the drug's name, its total number of treatments, and its calculated average drug amount per treatment.

    *   `.CALCULATE(drug_name = drug_name, ...)`: After selecting the top 5 drugs, this final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  **`num_matching_treatments = COUNT(Treatments.WHERE(...))`**: We want to count the number of `Treatments` that satisfy a set of conditions. The `COUNT` function will tally the treatments returned by the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection. A treatment must meet all the following conditions (combined with `&`):
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment.
        *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Checks if the lowercase diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"". The `%` are wildcards matching any sequence of characters.
    *   **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**:
        *   `drug.fda_appr_dt`: Accesses the FDA approval date of the drug used in the treatment.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if this field is present (not null), indicating the drug is FDA-approved.
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**:
        *   Ensures that the treatment has an `end_dt` (end date) recorded.
    *   **`(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`**:
        *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time 6 months prior to the current moment.
        *   `end_dt >= ...`: Checks if the treatment's end date is on or after this date (i.e., within the last 6 months).
    *   **`(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**:
        *   `DATETIME('now')`: Represents the current date and time.
        *   `end_dt <= ...`: Checks if the treatment's end date is on or before the current moment.

Together, these conditions identify treatments for diagnoses related to 'psoriasis', using FDA-approved drugs, and which concluded in the six-month period leading up to and including today.

**Explanation:**

1.  `first_treatment_details_expr`: This contextless expression defines how to find the first treatment for any given doctor.
    *   `Doctors.prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1)`: Filters these treatments to find the one(s) that rank first when ordered by `start_dt` (ascending). `per=""Doctors""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each doctor's treatments. `allow_ties=False` ensures that if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, only one is ranked as 1 (the choice among ties is database-dependent but consistent).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which should be a single treatment record due to `RANKING ... == 1` and `allow_ties=False`) into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields. If no treatments exist, or if the filter yields no results, this will be a null record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`qualifying_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by filtering the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `is_placebo == True`: This condition ensures we only consider treatments that are placebos.
    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This is a crucial condition. It checks if the current treatment has at least one record in its `concomitant_meds` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause.
        *   The inner `WHERE` clause `(concomitant_meds.start_dt >= start_dt) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, concomitant_meds.start_dt) <= 14)` filters concomitant medications.
            *   `concomitant_meds.start_dt >= start_dt`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date (`start_dt` here refers to `Treatments.start_dt`).
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, concomitant_meds.start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started within 14 days (2 weeks) of the treatment's start date. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days.

2.  **`result = qualifying_treatments.concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Once we have the `qualifying_treatments`, we access their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This means for each qualifying treatment, we will iterate through all its associated concomitant medications.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the output rows. For each concomitant medication of a qualifying treatment, it selects:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`: The ID of the parent treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_dt = treatment.start_dt`: The start date of the parent treatment.
        *   `treatment_end_dt = treatment.end_dt`: The end date of the parent treatment.

        *   `concomitant_med_end_dt = end_dt`: The end date of the current concomitant medication (from the `concomitant_meds` collection).

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To calculate the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages.
5.  Round the final average age to the nearest integer.
6.  The result will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE()` to present it.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level collection `DermTreatment` because we want a single aggregated result.
2.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Male"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients who are male and have private insurance.
    *   `gender == ""Male""`: Filters for male patients.
    *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Filters for patients with private insurance.
    *   `&`: The logical AND operator combines these two conditions.
4.  `.CALCULATE(current_age=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their age.
    *   `current_age=...`: A new temporary field `current_age` is created.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`: This function calculates the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`).
5.  `.current_age`: This accesses the `current_age` calculated in the previous step, which is then used by the `AVG` function.
6.  `ROUND(..., 0)`: Finally, the calculated average age is rounded to 0 decimal places, effectively converting it to an integer.
7.  `average_patient_age=...`: The final result is assigned to the field `average_patient_age`.",14.422919511795044,"avg_age_male_private_patients = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we need to calculate two values based on their received transactions:
    *   The number of distinct coupons used in successful transactions.
    *   The total number of distinct successful transactions.
3.  The CPUR is then the ratio of these two values.
4.  We will handle cases where there are no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
5.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

We'll use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
*   The first `CALCULATE` will compute the raw counts for distinct coupons used and distinct successful transactions, aliasing the merchant's name.
*   The second `CALCULATE` will use these computed counts to determine the CPUR and select the merchant's name and the CPUR for the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to prepare the necessary components for the CPUR calculation.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: The merchant's `name` is selected and aliased as `merchant_name_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons_val=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the numerator for CPUR.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"" AND have an associated coupon (checked using `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
        *   `.coupon.cid`: From these filtered transactions, it accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the associated coupons.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `num_distinct_transactions_val=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the denominator for CPUR.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the total number of such successful transactions.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one to compute the final CPUR and select the desired output fields.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: The aliased merchant name is selected for the output.
    *   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_transactions_val > 0, ... , 0.0)`: This is a conditional expression.
            *   If `num_distinct_transactions_val` (the count of successful transactions) is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division: `num_distinct_coupons_val / num_distinct_transactions_val`.
            *   Otherwise (if there are no successful transactions), CPUR is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.

1.  Define a contextless expression for the start of the current week. This will be used as a reference point.
2.  Filter the `Users` collection to include only users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  Access the `notifications` sub-collection for these filtered users.
4.  For each notification, calculate two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start_ts`: The `created_at` timestamp truncated to the start of its week. This allows grouping by week.
    *   `is_weekend_notification`: A boolean indicating if the notification's `created_at` timestamp falls on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using the `DAYNAME` function.
5.  Filter these augmented notifications to include only those from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week. This is achieved by:
    *   Calculating the difference in weeks between the `notification_week_start_ts` and the `current_week_start_val` using `DATEDIFF`.
    *   Keeping only notifications where this difference is 1 (last week), 2 (two weeks ago), or 3 (three weeks ago).
6.  Partition the resulting set of notifications by `notification_week_start_ts`. This groups all relevant notifications by the week they were sent.

**Explanation:**

The query first establishes `current_week_start_val` as the beginning of the current week. It then filters users to those in the ""US"" or ""Canada"". For each notification from these users, it determines the start of the week the notification was created (`notification_week_start_ts`) and whether it was sent on a weekend (`is_weekend_notification`).

Next, it filters these notifications to include only those from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week. This is done using `DATEDIFF` to find notifications where the difference between their week-start and the current week-start is 1, 2, or 3 weeks.

These filtered notifications are then partitioned by `notification_week_start_ts`. Within each partition (representing a specific week), the query calculates:
-   `week_start_date`: The start date of that week.
-   `total_notifications_in_week`: The total count of notifications for that week.
-   `weekend_notifications_in_week`: The count of notifications sent on weekends during that week, by summing the `is_weekend_notification` boolean values.

Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order, presenting the data for the most recent of the three requested weeks first. The final output is assigned to the `result` variable.",49.87583327293396,"# Define the start of the current week for reference

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and then apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   **`(status == ""active"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `status` is ""active"".
    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `category` is ""retail"". The `LOWER()` function is used on the `category` field to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, matching ""Retail"", ""retail"", ""RETAIL"", etc.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition filters for merchants who have at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS(coupons)` function returns true (or 1 in PyDough's boolean context) if the `coupons` sub-collection for a merchant is not empty.
    *   The `&` operator is used to combine these conditions, so a merchant must satisfy all three to be included.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use the `CALCULATE` function to specify the output fields.

    *   `.transactions_sent` accesses the transactions sent by these US users.
    *   Another `WHERE` clause is applied to these transactions:

We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now'))` which calculates the number of full days between `updated_at` and the current moment. A result of 0 means `updated_at` is today, and 7 means `updated_at` was exactly 7 days ago. So, we filter for values between 0 and 7.

1.  Access each user from the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, look into their `balances` (which is a list of `UserBalances` records).
3.  Within these balances, identify the most recent one. The `UserBalances` collection has an `updated_at` field that we can use for this. We can use the `RANKING` window function to rank balances by `updated_at` in descending order for each user. The balance with rank 1 will be the latest.
4.  Extract the `balance` amount from this latest record.
5.  The final result should include user identifiers (like `uid` and `username`) and their LUB.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each user.
2.  `user_uid=uid, user_username=username`: We select the `uid` and `username` as identifiers for each user, renaming them to `user_uid` and `user_username` respectively.
3.  `latest_user_balance=...`: This defines the LUB.
    *   `balances`: This refers to the sub-collection of `UserBalances` associated with the current user.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This function ranks the balance records within the `balances` sub-collection for each user (`per=""Users""`). The ranking is based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (`updated_at.DESC()`), so the most recent balance gets rank 1.
        *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the balance record that has rank 1 (i.e., the latest one).

This rank is based on the revenue generated from successfully received transactions, specifically where the `receiver_type` is 1 (indicating a merchant). We need to return the merchant's name, category, their calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank (MRR).

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Start with Merchants**: We iterate through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  **Calculate Revenue**: For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue.
    *   This involves looking at their `transactions_received`.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those that were `successful` and where the `receiver_type` is `1`. The problem statement specifies `receiver_type=1` for transactions to merchants. Although transactions in `Merchants.transactions_received` inherently have the merchant as the receiver (and thus should have `receiver_type` indicating 'MERCHANT'), we include this filter explicitly as per the problem's instruction.
    *   We then sum the `amount` of these filtered transactions. We assume that if a merchant has no such transactions, this sum will be 0.
3.  **Assign Rank (MRR)**: After calculating the revenue for all merchants, we rank them.
    *   The rank (named `MRR`) is based on `revenue_amount` in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).
    *   We'll use `allow_ties=True` in the `RANKING` function so that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).
4.  **Select Output Fields**: We select the `merchant_name` (from `name`), `merchant_category` (from `category`), the calculated `revenue_amount`, and the `MRR`.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, we order the results by `MRR` in ascending order for clear presentation.

We make the following assumptions:
*   The status of a successful transaction is represented by the string `""successful""` in the `status` field of the `Transactions` collection.
*   `receiver_type == 1` is the correct condition to identify transactions where the receiver is a merchant.
*   The `SUM` aggregation function will return `0` if there are no transactions meeting the criteria for a merchant.

```python

merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `revenue_amount=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`: This calculates the total revenue for the merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the current merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is ""successful"" and `receiver_type` is 1.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Aggregates these amounts to get the total revenue for the merchant.

2.  `merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call takes the result from the first step (which includes merchant name, category, and their revenue amount) and adds the rank.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`, `merchant_category=merchant_category`, `revenue_amount=revenue_amount`: These pass through the already calculated/selected fields.
    *   `MRR=RANKING(by=revenue_amount.DESC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank for each merchant.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: The ranking function.
        *   `by=revenue_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that ranking should be based on `revenue_amount` in descending order (higher revenue means better rank).
        *   `allow_ties=True`: Ensures that if multiple merchants have the same `revenue_amount`, they receive the same rank.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average of Daily Active Users (DAU) for each month in the specified period.
- A **Daily Active User (DAU)** for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from transactions where `sender_type == 0` on that particular day.
- The **PMDAU** for a month is the average of these DAU counts over all days in that month.
- The results are aggregated and presented per month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"").

The calculation involves the following steps:
1.  **Determine Date Range**: Identify the start of the month two months ago and the start of the current month. The transactions considered will be within this range (e.g., if the current month is May, transactions from March 1st up to, but not including, May 1st will be included, covering all of March and April).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that have `sender_type == 0` and fall within the calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Aggregation**: For each relevant transaction, extract:
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-03"") for final monthly grouping.
    *   `day_date`: The date of the transaction, truncated to the start of the day (e.g., ""2023-03-15 00:00:00""), for daily grouping.
    *   `sender_id`: The ID of the sender.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transactions by `year_month_str` and `day_date`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each day), count the number of distinct `sender_id`s. This gives the `dau_count` for that day.
5.  **Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   Group the daily `dau_count`s by `year_month_str`.

1.  Filter the `UserSessions` collection to include only sessions that started on or after `2023-06-01T00:00:00` and before `2023-06-08T00:00:00`.
2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. This calculated duration, along with the `user_id`, will be part of an intermediate collection.
3.  Partition this intermediate collection by `user_id`. For each user (each partition group), calculate the sum of all their individual session durations. This gives the total session duration per user.
4.  The result of the partition will include the `user_id` and their `total_duration`.
5.  Finally, sort these results by `total_duration` in descending order using `ORDER_BY`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserSessions for the specified date range.
# Then, for each session, calculate its duration in seconds.
# The 'user_id' field is carried over from UserSessions.
sessions_in_range_with_duration = UserSessions.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `UserSessions` collection. It keeps only those sessions where `session_start_ts` is within the desired range: from `2023-06-01 00:00:00` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `2023-06-08 00:00:00`.
2.  `.CALCULATE(duration_secs = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, this calculates the duration in seconds by subtracting `session_start_ts` from `session_end_ts` using `DATEDIFF`. The result is stored in a new temporary field `duration_secs`. The original `user_id` from `UserSessions` is implicitly carried forward.
3.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration.PARTITION(name=""user_group"", by=(user_id))`: This takes the collection of sessions (each now having a `user_id` and `duration_secs`) and groups them by `user_id`. Each group is internally referred to as `user_group`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id, total_duration = SUM(user_group.duration_secs))`: For each `user_group` (i.e., for each unique `user_id`), this calculates two fields:
    *   `user_id`: This is the `user_id` for the current group.
    *   `total_duration`: This is the sum of `duration_secs` for all sessions belonging to that `user_id` within the `user_group`.
5.  `result = user_total_session_duration.ORDER_BY(total_duration.DESC())`: Finally, this sorts the resulting collection (which contains `user_id` and their `total_duration`) in descending order based on the `total_duration`. The user with the longest total session duration will appear first. The result is assigned to the variable `result`.",64.64074158668518,"# Step 1: Filter UserSessions for the specified date range.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`**: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Merchants` collection and filters it to select only the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is equal to `1`.
2.  **`.coupons`**: From the selected merchant (with `mid == 1`), this accesses its `coupons` sub-collection. This gives us a list of all coupons offered by this specific merchant.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is then applied to each coupon in the list obtained from the previous step.
    *   **`coupon_id=cid`**: It selects the `cid` (coupon ID) for each coupon and renames it to `coupon_id` in the output.
    *   **`total_transacted_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`**: For each coupon, it accesses the `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which lists all transactions where this coupon was used). It then calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these transactions, effectively giving the total amount transacted using that specific coupon. The result is named `total_transacted_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we are calculating an aggregate value (total count) across a subset of `UserSessions`.
2.  `tuc_count = COUNT(...)`: This defines a new field `tuc_count` which will hold the total number of user sessions.
3.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `UserSessions` collection and apply a filter.
4.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This function call generates a timestamp representing exactly one month prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function call generates the current timestamp.
    *   The condition filters sessions whose `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to one month ago and less than or equal to the current moment, effectively covering the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"".
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `UserSessions` records that satisfy the `WHERE` clause condition.

2.  Filter all transactions to include only those that occurred within this date range. We'll assume ""wallet transactions"" refer to all transactions in the `Transactions` collection, as the database is an `Ewallet` system.
3.  Identify ""successful transactions."" We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` is ""completed"".

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date`: This variable defines the beginning of the previous month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), truncating it to the start of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracting one month (`'-1 month'`).
2.  `current_month_start_date`: This variable defines the end of the previous month (exclusive), which is equivalent to the beginning of the current month. It's calculated by taking the current timestamp and truncating it to the start of the current month.
3.  `transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the `prev_month_start_date` (inclusive) and `current_month_start_date` (exclusive).
4.  `str_calculation_output = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This block performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` graph level, resulting in a single row.
    *   `num_successful_transactions`: Counts transactions from `transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is ""completed"". This is our definition of a successful transaction.
    *   `num_total_transactions`: Counts all transactions within `transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_str = ...)`: This chained `CALCULATE` uses the counts from the previous step to compute the STR.
    *   `IFF(num_total_transactions > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This conditional function checks if there were any transactions in the previous month.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `num_successful_transactions * 1.0 / num_total_transactions`. The `* 1.0` ensures floating-point division.
        *   If `num_total_transactions` is 0 (to prevent division by zero), `calculated_str` is set to `0.0`.
6.  `result = str_calculation_output.CALCULATE(previous_month_str = calculated_str)`: This final step selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str`, and assigns it to the `result` variable, ensuring only the requested value is returned.",32.102787733078,"# Define the start and end dates for the previous month

    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition ensures that the user has at least one notification that satisfies both sub-conditions:
        *   `notification_type == 'promotional'`: The notification's type must be exactly 'promotional'.
        *   `status == 'unread'`: The notification's status must be exactly 'unread'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two main conditions, so a user must be from the US AND have at least one relevant unread promotional notification.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the users who pass the `WHERE` clause, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   `username=username`: Selects the `username` of the user.
    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`: Counts the number of notifications for each selected user that are of type 'promotional' and have a status of 'unread'.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`**: This selects the desired information for the filtered merchants.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_transactions_with_country = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection to only include transactions where `sender_type` is `0`, indicating the sender is a user.
    *   `CALCULATE` then derives new fields for each of these transactions:
        *   `sender_country_field`: The country of the user who sent the transaction, obtained via `sending_user.country`.
        *   `sender_user_id_field`: The UID of the sending user, obtained via `sending_user.uid`. This will be used to count distinct users.
        *   `transaction_value`: The `amount` of the transaction.

2.  `country_level_summary = user_transactions_with_country.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the `user_transactions_with_country` collection and partitions it by `sender_country_field`. This groups all transactions by the country of the sending user.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each country group:
        *   `country_name_output=sender_country_field`: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
        *   `total_transaction_amount_calc=SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of transaction amounts for all transactions within the current country group. `Transactions.amount` refers to the `amount` field of the original `Transactions` records that fall into this partition.
        *   `distinct_users_count_calc=NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user.uid)`: Counts the number of unique sending users (based on their `uid`) within the current country group.

3.  `top_5_countries_by_total_amount = country_level_summary.TOP_K(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `country_level_summary` (which has one record per country with aggregated data) and selects the top 5 records.
    *   The selection is based on `total_transaction_amount_calc` in descending order (`DESC()`), so countries with the highest total transaction amounts are chosen.

4.  `result = top_5_countries_by_total_amount.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   Finally, this `CALCULATE` formats the output for the top 5 countries, renaming the fields to match the requested output: `country`, `number_of_distinct_users`, and `total_transaction_amount`.",47.62328577041626,"# Step 1: Filter transactions sent by users (sender_type = 0) and calculate necessary fields.

1.  **Identify the latest balance for each merchant**: We access all merchant balance entries (`Merchants.balances`). For each merchant, we rank their balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order and select the top one. This gives us the most recent balance for every merchant who has balance records. ""Today's balance"" is interpreted as this most recent balance.
2.  **Filter these latest balances based on merchant criteria**: From the set of latest balance entries, we keep only those whose associated merchant:
    *   Has `status == 'active'`.
    *   Has a `category` that contains 'retail'. The search for 'retail' is made case-insensitive by converting the category to lowercase.
3.  **Calculate the median**: For the final set of filtered balance entries, we calculate the median of their `balance` amounts. This will be a single value representing the requested median.

The query is structured to handle cases where merchants might not have balance entries or where no merchants meet the specified criteria (in which case the median would typically be null).

```python
# Step 1: Get the latest balance entry for each merchant.
# Merchants.balances refers to all balance entries across all merchants.
# RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1 identifies the most recent balance entry for each merchant.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_balance_entries = Merchants.balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing `Merchants.balances`, which represents the collection of all balance records for all merchants.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records.
    *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1` assigns a rank to each balance record within the group of balances belonging to the same merchant (`per=""Merchants""`). The ranking is based on `updated_at` in descending order, so rank 1 is the most recent balance entry.
    *   The result, `latest_balance_entries`, is a collection of `MerchantBalance` records, containing exactly one (the most recent) balance entry for each merchant that has any balance entries.

2.  `filtered_latest_balances = latest_balance_entries.WHERE((merchant.status == 'active') & CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail'))`:
    *   This line takes the `latest_balance_entries` from the previous step.
    *   It applies another `WHERE` clause to filter these entries further.
    *   The condition `merchant.status == 'active'` checks if the merchant associated with the balance entry is active.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(merchant.category), 'retail')` checks if the merchant's category (converted to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity) contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   The result, `filtered_latest_balances`, is a collection of `MerchantBalance` records from active, retail-related merchants, representing their latest balances.

3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_merchant_balance = MEDIAN(filtered_latest_balances.balance))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result.
    *   `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)` creates a new collection with a single row (since `Ewallet` is the top-level graph object).
    *   `median_merchant_balance = MEDIAN(filtered_latest_balances.balance)` calculates the median of the `balance` attribute for all records in the `filtered_latest_balances` collection. This value is assigned to the field `median_merchant_balance`.

The final `result` will be a single-row collection with one column, `median_merchant_balance`, holding the calculated median value.

Explanation:
- The first `CALCULATE` method is applied to the `UserSessions` collection. It computes a new field `session_len_seconds` for each session, representing the duration of the session in seconds by finding the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`.
- The `PARTITION` method then groups these sessions based on their `device_type`. Each group is named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.
- The second `CALCULATE` method operates on these partitioned groups.
    - `device_type = device_type`: This selects the `device_type` (which is the key for the partition).
    - `average_duration_seconds = AVG(UserSessions.session_len_seconds)`: This calculates the average of the `session_len_seconds` (computed in the first step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. `UserSessions.session_len_seconds` refers to the `session_len_seconds` field that was conceptually added to each record of `UserSessions` by the initial `CALCULATE` operation.

1.  Filter the `Merchants` collection to include only those who have at least one coupon using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
2.  For each of these merchants, we calculate:
    *   Their merchant ID (`mid`).

    *   The details of their earliest coupon. This is achieved by accessing the merchant's `coupons` sub-collection, selecting the coupon with the earliest `start_date` using `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`, and then using `.SINGULAR()` to treat this single coupon record as a singular object from which we can extract its `cid` and `start_date`.
3.  Next, we filter these merchants based on the timing of their earliest coupon:
    *   The coupon's `start_date` must be on or after the merchant's registration date (`earliest_c.start_date >= m_registration_date`).
    *   The coupon's `start_date` must be within one year of the merchant's registration date. This is checked by ensuring the `start_date` is less than or equal to the date one year after the registration date, calculated using `DATETIME(m_registration_date, '+1 year')`.

"Which users did not get a notification within the first year of signing up?

1.  Access the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, determine their sign-up date (which is the `created_at` field for the user).
3.  Calculate the date that is exactly one year after their sign-up date.
4.  Filter out users who have at least one notification whose `created_at` date is on or before this one-year-after-signup mark. This means we want users for whom *no* notification meets this criterion.
5.  From the remaining users, select their `username`, `email`, and their sign-up date (`created_at`).

We can use the `HASNOT` function to check for the absence of notifications within the specified period. The `DATETIME` function will be used to calculate the date one year after the user's creation date.

```python
users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
    HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    user_name=username,
    user_email=email,
    signup_date=created_at
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users`: We start by querying the `Users` collection.
2.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the users based on a condition.
3.  `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1`:
    *   `Users.created_at`: This refers to the sign-up date of the current user being evaluated.
    *   `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`: This calculates the date exactly one year after the user's sign-up date.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at <= ...)`: This filters the `notifications` sub-collection for the current user. It selects only those notifications whose `created_at` date (the notification's creation date) is less than or equal to one year after the user's sign-up date.
    *   `HASNOT(...) == 1`: This condition is true if the filtered `notifications` collection (i.e., notifications received within the first year) is empty. This means the user either had no notifications at all, or all their notifications occurred after their first year.
4.  `.CALCULATE(user_name=username, user_email=email, signup_date=created_at)`: For the users who satisfy the `WHERE` condition, this selects their `username`, `email`, and `created_at` (signup date), renaming them to `user_name`, `user_email`, and `signup_date` respectively in the output.",20.319869995117188,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
