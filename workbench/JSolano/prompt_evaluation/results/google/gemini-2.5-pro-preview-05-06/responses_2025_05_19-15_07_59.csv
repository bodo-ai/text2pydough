).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It filters these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions in total. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the number of transactions for each customer, and the `WHERE` clause keeps only those for whom this count is 5 or more.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This operation is performed on the filtered set of customers (those with >= 5 transactions).
    *   `customer_name=name`: It selects the `name` of each customer and assigns it to a new field `customer_name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the success rate for each of these customers.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be a successful transaction.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer. Due to the preceding `WHERE` clause, this count will be at least 5, preventing division by zero.
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted in ascending order based on the `success_rate`. Customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.

This query assumes that a transaction is considered ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to ""Completed"".",27.17383909225464,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`**:
    This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols`, which stores the ticker symbols for FAANG companies. This makes the query cleaner and easier to read.

2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    This part of the query starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these customers based on two conditions combined with a logical AND (`&`):
    *   **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`**:
        *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions made by each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: This filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (the symbol of the stock involved in the transaction) is one of the symbols listed in the `faang_symbols` tuple (i.e., ""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", or ""NFLX"").
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the customer has at least one transaction that matches the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., at least one FAANG stock transaction).

    The `filtered_customers` variable will hold the collection of customers who satisfy both the email condition and the FAANG stock transaction condition.

3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_distinct_customers = COUNT(filtered_customers))`**:
    *   This line calculates the final result at the `Broker` (top) level.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)`: This aggregation function counts the number of distinct customers present in the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `num_distinct_customers = ...`: The result of the count is assigned to a new field named `num_distinct_customers`.

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined on or after January 1, 2023, and whose status is 'Active'. The `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` function is used to ensure the comparison includes the entire day of January 1, 2023, by setting the time to the beginning of the day.
2.  Partition these filtered customers by their `country`. This groups the customers based on their country of origin.
3.  For each country group, calculate the `country` and the count of customers within that group. This count represents the TAC for that specific country. The `COUNT(Customers)` function is used here to count the customers in each partition.

**Explanation:**

*   `active_customers_on_or_after_2023 = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `join_date >= DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")`: This condition selects customers whose join date is on or after January 1, 2023. `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"", ""start of day"")` creates a datetime value for the beginning of January 1, 2023, ensuring accurate comparison even if `join_date` includes a time component.
    *   `status == ""Active""`: This condition further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers meeting both criteria are selected.
*   `result = active_customers_on_or_after_2023.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered customers and partitions them.
    *   `name=""country_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition, which is good practice but not directly used in this specific `CALCULATE` clause.

1.  **Establish Current Time Context**: We first calculate the start of the current week (`current_sow_val`) at the graph level. This will serve as a reference point for determining ""weeks ago"".
2.  **Filter and Augment Transactions**:
    *   Access all `Transactions`.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those related to stocks by checking `ticker.ticker_type == ""STOCK""`. (Assuming ""STOCK"" is the string representation for stock types).
    *   For each of these stock transactions, we calculate:
        *   `transaction_dt`: The actual date and time of the transaction.
        *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") for the transaction.
        *   `weeks_ago`: The number of weeks that have passed between the transaction's week and the current week. This is calculated using `DATEDIFF` between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, divided by 7.
3.  **Select Relevant Weeks**: We then filter these augmented transactions to keep only those where `weeks_ago` is between 1 and 8 (inclusive). This selects the 8 full weeks prior to the current week.
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered transactions are then partitioned by `transaction_week_start_dt`. This groups all transactions that occurred in the same week.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts**: For each weekly group (partition):
    *   We output `week_start_date` (which is the `transaction_week_start_dt` partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: We count all transactions within that week's group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: We count transactions within that week's group that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is done by filtering the group's transactions using `Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")))` and then counting them.
6.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

```python
# Define a graph-level calculation to get the start of the current week
graph_context = Broker.CALCULATE(
    current_sow_val = DATETIME(DATETIME('now'), 'start of week')
)

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `graph_context = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining `current_sow_val` which represents the start date of the current week. This is calculated once at the `Broker` (graph) level.
2.  `relevant_transactions_with_week_info = graph_context.Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We access `Transactions` via `graph_context` so that `current_sow_val` is available. Transactions are first filtered to include only those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is ""STOCK"".
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on transactions): For each stock transaction, we derive:
    *   `transaction_dt`: The original transaction timestamp.
    *   `transaction_week_start_dt`: The start date of the week the transaction falls into.
    *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Saturday"").
    *   `weeks_ago`: Calculated by finding the difference in days between the transaction's week start and `current_sow_val`, then dividing by 7. A value of 1 means last week, 2 means the week before last, and so on.
4.  `.WHERE((weeks_ago >= 1) & (weeks_ago <= 8))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that occurred in the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
5.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts = relevant_transactions_with_week_info.PARTITION(...)`: The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `transaction_week_start_dt`. Each partition represents a unique week.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (on partitions): For each week's partition:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of that week (the partition key).
    *   `total_transactions_in_week`: Counts all transactions belonging to that specific week's partition using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `weekend_transactions_in_week`: Counts transactions within the current week's partition where the `day_name` (calculated earlier for each transaction) is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.
7.  `.ORDER_BY(week_start_date.DESC())`: The final result is ordered by the week start date in descending order, showing data for the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

    total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of last week. This is done by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`), finding the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and then subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
        *   `_start_of_current_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week, which serves as the exclusive end boundary for last week.

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` clause builds upon the first one:
        *   It accesses `Customers` from the `Broker` collection.
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")` filters these customers to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made` then accesses all transactions made by these US-based customers.
        *   Another `.WHERE(...)` clause filters these transactions based on their `date_time`:
            *   `date_time >= _start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of last week.
            *   `date_time < _start_of_current_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current week.
        *   The result of this filtering is assigned to a temporary variable `_filtered_transactions`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   The third `CALCULATE` clause takes the `_filtered_transactions` collection:
        *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(_filtered_transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions that met all the criteria.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(_filtered_transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these filtered transactions.

The final result, `last_week_transactions_summary`, will be a collection with a single row containing two columns: `number_of_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`, representing the requested data for customers from the USA for transactions made last week.",20.72179913520813,"# Define the start and end dates for ""last week""

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The first `CALCULATE` clause computes three new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field from the `Customers` collection.

2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred on or after 10 days ago from the current moment. We use `DATETIME('now', '-10 days')` to get this past date.

4.  Group these transactions by the `ticker_symbol_val` using `PARTITION`.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), count the number of transactions. This count represents the number of buy transactions for that symbol in the specified period. This is done using `CALCULATE(ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_val, num_buy_transactions = COUNT(Transactions))`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two dynamic date boundaries using the `Broker` (high-level graph) context. `report_end_date` is set to the first day of the current month. `report_start_date` is calculated by taking `report_end_date` and subtracting 6 months. This effectively gives us a 6-month window *before* the current month.
2.  `date_boundaries.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them based on their `join_date` to include only those who signed up within our calculated `report_start_date` (inclusive) and `report_end_date` (exclusive).
3.  `relevant_customers.CALCULATE(...)`: For these filtered customers, we extract the `signup_year_val` (year of join date) and `signup_month_val` (month of join date). These will be used for grouping.
4.  `customers_with_signup_details.PARTITION(...)`: We partition the customers into monthly cohorts based on their `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)` (after PARTITION): For each monthly cohort:
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val` and `signup_month=signup_month_val`: These are the year and month identifiers for the cohort.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the Per Month Customer Signups by counting the number of `Customers` records within each partition (i.e., each signup month).
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: This calculates the Per Month Average Transaction Amount. It accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection for all customers within the current monthly cohort, then takes the `amount` from each transaction, and finally computes the average. If a cohort has customers with no transactions, `AVG` will typically return `None`.
6.  `monthly_metrics.ORDER_BY(...)`: The final result is ordered chronologically by `signup_year` and then `signup_month`.

This query will output a table where each row represents a month from the specified 6-month period, showing the year, month, the number of customers who signed up in that month (PMCS), and their average transaction amount (PMAT).",36.49591636657715,"# Step 1: Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month.

        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the price's `date` and the current moment ('now').
        *   A value of 0 means the price is from today.
        *   A value of 6 means the price is from 7 days ago.
        *   The condition `< 7` includes dates from 0 to 6 days ago.
    *   From these filtered daily prices, take the `close` (closing price).

1.  **Identify the base group of customers**: Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022 and have at least one transaction. The `transactions_made` sub-collection can be checked using `HAS()`.
2.  **Partition by country**: Group the filtered customers by their `country`.
3.  **Calculate counts for AR**: For each country group:

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_for_ar_calculation`: This line filters the `Customers` collection. It selects customers who meet two conditions:
    *   `YEAR(join_date) == 2022`: The customer joined in the year 2022.
    *   `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`: The customer has made at least one transaction.

2.  `country_level_stats`: This part takes the `customers_for_ar_calculation` and partitions them by `country`. For each country:
    *   `country_name=country`: The country name is selected.
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions=COUNT(Customers.WHERE(status == ""Active""))`: This counts how many customers within the current country partition (who already meet the join year and transaction criteria) have their `status` field as ""Active"".
    *   `total_customers_with_transactions=COUNT(Customers)`: This counts the total number of customers within the current country partition (all of whom meet the join year and transaction criteria). This forms the denominator for the AR.

3.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the Activity Ratio (AR) and formats the output:
    *   `country=country_name`: Selects the country name for the output.
    *   `AR=IFF(...)`: Calculates the AR using the formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
        *   `IFF(total_customers_with_transactions > 0, ... , 0.0)` is used to prevent division by zero. If a country has no customers meeting the criteria for the denominator (which shouldn't happen for countries appearing in `country_level_stats` due to prior filtering, but is a safe check), AR is set to 0.0. The multiplication by `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage.",46.50065541267395,"# Step 1: Filter customers who joined in 2022 and have at least one transaction.

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and create a working version with aliased fields for clarity, including the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), transaction date/time, type, amount, tax, and commission.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions within the specified date range. ""Past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" is interpreted as the period from the start of the calendar month that was one month ago, up to the current date and time. For example, if today is July 15th, this range would be from June 1st to July 15th. This is achieved using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month', 'start of month')` for the start date and `DATETIME('now')` for the end date.
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol**: Partition the filtered sell transactions by their ticker symbol. This allows us to perform aggregations for each ticker.
4.  **Aggregate Financials per Ticker**: For each ticker group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_sell_amount` by summing the `amount` of sell transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_tax` by summing the `tax` associated with these transactions.
    *   Calculate `total_commission` by summing the `commission` for these transactions.
5.  **Calculate SPM**: Using the aggregated values for each ticker, calculate the SPM with the provided formula:
    `SPM = (Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`
    This translates to:
    `SPM = (total_sell_amount - (total_tax + total_commission)) / total_sell_amount * 100.0`
    We will handle cases where `total_sell_amount` is zero to prevent division by zero, setting SPM to 0.0 in such instances.
6.  **Format Output**: Select and return only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM` for each ticker.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each daily price record, extract the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the year, and the month from the `date`. Create a formatted month-year string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") for display and grouping.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and the formatted month-year string (along with numeric year and month for sorting). Within each group (each ticker-month), calculate:
    *   Average closing price (`AVG(DailyPrices.close)`)
    *   Highest price for the month (`MAX(DailyPrices.high)`)
    *   Lowest price for the month (`MIN(DailyPrices.low)`)
    This results in a new collection where each row represents a specific ticker's performance for a specific month.
3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month Change (MoMC)**:
    *   Take the collection of monthly aggregates from the previous step.
    *   Partition this collection by ticker symbol. This creates groups, where each group contains all monthly records for a single ticker.
    *   Within each ticker's group of monthly records, use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month. The records must be ordered by year and then month for `PREV` to work correctly. The `per` argument of `PREV` will ensure it operates independently for each ticker.
    *   With the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where there is no previous month (first month of data for a ticker) or where the previous month's average closing price is zero to avoid division by zero errors. In such cases, MoMC will be set to `None`.

The final result will include the ticker symbol, month (YYYY-MM), average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   It renames `date`, `high`, and `low` fields to `price_date`, `price_high`, and `price_low` respectively for clarity or to avoid potential naming conflicts.
    *   Crucially, it fetches the stock symbol (`ticker.symbol`) from the related `Tickers` table and names it `stock_symbol_value`. This performs an implicit join.

2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the records generated in the previous step to include only those where `price_date` falls between April 1, 2023, and April 4, 2023, inclusive.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""stock_group"", by=(stock_symbol_value))`**:
    *   The filtered records are then partitioned (grouped) by `stock_symbol_value`. This ensures that calculations are done for each distinct stock symbol.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_join_details`: This first `CALCULATE` statement iterates through all `Customers`. For each customer, it extracts their `_id` (as `c_id`), `name` (as `c_name`), the `YEAR` of their `join_date` (as `c_join_year`), and the `MONTH` of their `join_date` (as `c_join_month`).
2.  `customer_transactions_in_join_month`: This second `CALCULATE` statement operates on the `customer_join_details` collection. For each customer, it counts their `transactions_made`. The `WHERE` clause within the `COUNT` function filters these transactions to include only those where the transaction's `YEAR(date_time)` matches `c_join_year` and `MONTH(date_time)` matches `c_join_month` (the join year/month calculated in the previous step). The result is stored as `num_txns_in_join_mth`. The `c_id` and `c_name` are passed through.
3.  `top_customer_info`: This uses `TOP_K(1, by=num_txns_in_join_mth.DESC())` to find the single customer who has the highest `num_txns_in_join_mth`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
4.  `result`: The final `CALCULATE` statement takes the single record from `top_customer_info` and formats it to match the requested output fields: `_id` (from `c_id`), `name` (from `c_name`), and `number_of_transactions` (from `num_txns_in_join_mth`).",45.56072115898132,"# Step 1: For each customer, calculate their join year and month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Filtering**:
    *   First, a `date_condition` is defined to filter transactions. It selects transactions where the `date_time` is on or after January 1, 2023, and before April 1, 2023. Using `DATETIME(<date_string>, 'start of day')` ensures comparisons are made from the beginning of the respective days. This range inclusively covers all transactions from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(date_condition)` applies this filter to the `Transactions` collection, resulting in `filtered_transactions_by_date`.

2.  **Grouping and Aggregation**:
    *   `filtered_transactions_by_date.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(transaction_type))` groups the filtered transactions based on their `transaction_type`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`:  The transaction type itself.
        *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT` is used on `customer_id` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
        *   `avg_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: The average number of shares for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG` is used on `shares` from the `Transactions` sub-collection of the partition group.
    *   This step results in `transaction_type_summary`, a collection where each row represents a transaction type with its associated distinct customer count and average shares.

3.  **Selecting Top 3**:
    *   `transaction_type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())` takes the `transaction_type_summary` and selects the top 3 records.
    *   The ranking is based on `num_distinct_customers` in descending order (`DESC()`), so transaction types with more distinct customers rank higher.

4.  **Result**:
    *   The final `result` variable holds a collection containing the `transaction_type`, `num_distinct_customers`, and `avg_shares` for the top 3 transaction types as requested.",36.3074848651886,"# Define the date range condition for filtering transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**:
    *   This part of the query starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` function to group the customers based on their `country`. Each group is internally named `country_groups` (though this internal name is not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for accessing partition keys).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(country_name=country, num_customers=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   After partitioning, `CALCULATE` is applied to each group (each country).
    *   `country_name=country`: This selects the `country` field (which was used as a partitioning key) and renames it to `country_name` in the output.
    *   `num_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the total number of customers within each country group and names this new field `num_customers`. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the customer records within the current partition (i.e., for each specific country).

3.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=num_customers.DESC())`**:
    *   This function takes the collection of countries (each with its `country_name` and `num_customers`) produced by the previous step.
    *   It selects the top 5 records based on the `num_customers` field.
    *   `num_customers.DESC()`: Specifies that the sorting should be in descending order, so countries with the highest number of customers appear first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, we calculate three new fields:
        *   `country_of_customer`: Retrieves the country of the customer associated with the transaction (`customer.country`).
        *   `transaction_amount_val`: Stores the transaction's `amount`.
        *   `transaction_datetime`: Stores the transaction's `date_time`. This is done to use it in the subsequent `WHERE` clause.

2.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now') <= 30)`**:
    *   This filters the transactions, keeping only those that occurred within the last 30 days.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_datetime, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's date/time and the current moment.
    *   The condition `<= 30` ensures we include transactions from today (0 days ago) up to and including 30 days ago.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country_of_customer))`**:
    *   The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by the `country_of_customer`.
    *   Each group, named `country_groups` internally, will contain all transactions from a specific country that occurred in the last 30 days.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each country group created by the `PARTITION` step, we calculate:
        *   `country_name`: This is the `country_of_customer` for the current group.
        *   `num_transactions`: This counts the number of transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`) within the current country group. `Transactions` here refers to the sub-collection of transactions belonging to this specific country after filtering.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: This sums the `transaction_amount_val` for all transactions (`SUM(Transactions.transaction_amount_val)`) within the current country group.

2.  Filter these records to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` is ""VTI"".
3.  Further filter these records to include only those where the `date` is within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, 'now') < 7` for this, which means the difference in days between the price's date and the current moment is less than 7 (covering today and the 6 previous days).
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, calculate the minimum `close` price. This will be done by applying the `MIN()` aggregation function on the `close` field of the filtered data.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

What is the monthly average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023?,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-01', sbTxDateTime) AS datetime, AVG(sbTxPrice) AS avg_price FROM sbTransaction WHERE sbTxStatus = 'success' AND sbTxDateTime BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31' GROUP BY datetime ORDER BY datetime;",Broker,"To determine the monthly average transaction price for successful transactions in the 1st quarter of 2023, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the first quarter of 2023 (January, February, March) and had a status of ""successful"".
2.  For these filtered transactions, create a formatted string representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") to be used for grouping.
3.  Partition the filtered transactions by this year-month string.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction price.
5.  The result will show each month in Q1 2023 (that has successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price.

```python
# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and successful status, and prepare a year-month key
q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(
    (status == ""successful"") &
    (YEAR(date_time) == 2023) &

).CALCULATE(
    month = year_month_str,
    avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions that occurred in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitutes the first quarter.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year_month_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(date_time), LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")))`: For each filtered transaction, this creates a new field `year_month_str`.
        *   `YEAR(date_time)` extracts the year.
        *   `MONTH(date_time)` extracts the month number.
        *   `LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")` pads the month number with a leading zero if it's a single digit (e.g., 1 becomes ""01"").
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ...)` combines the year and padded month with a hyphen, creating a string like ""2023-01"".

2.  `monthly_average_prices = q1_2023_successful_transactions.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered and prepared transactions and partitions them.
    *   `name=""monthly_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` field names here, it's part of the syntax).
    *   `by=(year_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of `year_month_str`. This means all transactions for ""2023-01"" will be in one group, ""2023-02"" in another, and so on.

3.  `.CALCULATE(month = year_month_str, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `month = year_month_str`: Selects the `year_month_str` (which represents the month) for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the items in the `monthly_group` partition, which originate from the `Transactions` collection.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result by the month in ascending order (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02"", ""2023-03"").

The variable `monthly_average_prices` will hold the result, listing each month of Q1 2023 (that had successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price.",26.9365234375,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and successful status, and prepare a year-month key

1.  **`Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000.
2.  **`.payment`**: Accesses the `payment` sub-collection (which are `PaymentsReceived` records) associated with these filtered sales.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each payment, this step calculates two new attributes:
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Determines the start date of the calendar week (e.g., Monday) in which the `payment_date` falls.
    *   `is_weekend_payment_calc = ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, resulting in a boolean value.
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the payments based on their `payment_week_start_date_calc` to include only those from the last 8 full calendar weeks, excluding the current week.
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc >= DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-56 days')`: Ensures the payment week is on or after the start of the week that began 56 days (8 weeks) before the start of the current week.
    *   `payment_week_start_date_calc < DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Ensures the payment week is before the start of the current week, effectively excluding the current week.
5.  **`.PARTITION(name=""payments_grouped_by_week"", by=(payment_week_start_date_calc))`**: Groups the filtered payments by their `payment_week_start_date_calc`. Each group will contain all payments made within the same calendar week.

    number_of_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales_filtered),
    total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales_filtered.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales_filtered = Sales.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales based on two conditions combined with an `&` (AND) operator:
        *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This condition filters sales to include only those where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"". We access the car's make via the relationship `Sales.car.make`.
        *   The date condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29)` filters sales to those that occurred in the last 30 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date/time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
            *   `>= 0` ensures the `sale_date` is not in the future.
            *   `<= 29` ensures the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days (i.e., 0 days ago (today) up to 29 days ago).

2.  **`toyota_sales_summary = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Dealership` collection's `CALCULATE` method because the query asks for a single aggregated result (total number of sales and total revenue).
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales_filtered)`: This calculates the total number of sales that met the criteria defined in `recent_toyota_sales_filtered` by counting the records in that filtered collection.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales_filtered.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in the `recent_toyota_sales_filtered` collection, giving the total revenue from these sales. If there are no such sales, `SUM` will typically result in 0 or null depending on the system's behavior for summing an empty set.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates a calculation on the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, the specified fields will be computed.

2.  **`first_name = first_name,`**: Selects the `first_name` of the salesperson.
3.  **`last_name = last_name,`**: Selects the `last_name` of the salesperson.

4.  **`total_sales_amount = SUM(sales_made.sale_price),`**: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson.
    *   `sales_made` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each salesperson.
    *   `sale_price` is a field within each `Sale` record.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these sale prices to get the total sum for that salesperson. It's assumed that if a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.

5.  **`number_of_sales = COUNT(sales_made),`**: This counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.
    *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.

6.  **`SR = RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`**: This calculates the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.
    *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank.
    *   `by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC()` specifies that the ranking should be based on the total sales amount (re-calculated here as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` to ensure it's available for the `RANKING` function context), in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank. The default behavior for ties (assigning the same rank) is assumed.

The final result will be a collection where each record represents a salesperson and includes their first name, last name, total sales amount, the number of sales they made, and their sales rank (SR) based on their total sales amount.",49.25599193572998,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as this represents cars that have been sold.
2.  For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the associated car, and the `sale_price`.
3.  Crucially, for each car involved in a sale, we determine its latest inventory status. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the `inventory_snapshots` for that specific car.
    *   Using the `RANKING` function to find the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` (latest snapshot) for that car. The `per=""Cars""` argument ensures that ranking is performed distinctly for each car.
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to select this single latest snapshot.
    *   Retrieving the `is_in_inventory` status from this latest snapshot.
4.  We then filter these sales records, keeping only those where the car's `is_car_in_inventory_latest` status is `False`, indicating the car is no longer in inventory.
5.  The filtered sales are then grouped using `PARTITION` by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`.
6.  Within each group (i.e., for each make and model), we calculate the `MAX(sale_price_field)` to find the highest sale price.
7.  Finally, the results are ordered by this `highest_sale_price_output` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars`: We start by querying the `Cars` collection.
*   `.WHERE((LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")) )`: This filters the cars.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `make` contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards for partial matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase `model` contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains ""ford"" OR its model contains ""mustang"".
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These expressions select the respective car details.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. The `AVG` function computes the average of these prices. If a car has no sale records, the `avg_sale_price` will typically be null.",20.319318056106567,"result = Cars.WHERE(

Explanation:
1.  `initial_context`: We start by calculating `current_month_start_dt` (e.g., if today is 2023-06-15, this is 2023-06-01) and `six_months_ago_start_dt` (which would be 2022-12-01). These are global values for our query.
2.  `filtered_salespersons`: We select salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023.
3.  `relevant_sales`: We take the sales made by these `filtered_salespersons` and keep only those sales where `sale_date` is on or after `six_months_ago_start_dt` and before `current_month_start_dt`.
4.  `sales_with_month_info`: For each relevant sale, we extract `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month` (numerical year and month) and alias `sale_price` to `sale_price_val` for clarity in aggregation.
5.  `monthly_aggregated_data`: We partition (group) the `sales_with_month_info` by `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month`. For each month-group:
    *   `month`: A string representation like ""YYYY-MM"" is created for display.
    *   `PMSPS`: `COUNT(Sales)` counts the number of sales records in that month's group.
    *   `PMSR`: `SUM(sale_price_val)` sums the sale prices for that month's group.
6.  `final_result`: The aggregated data is ordered chronologically using the numerical `calc_sale_year` and `calc_sale_month`. The final output will contain columns `month`, `PMSPS`, and `PMSR`.

- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We use the `AVG` aggregation function on the `sale_price` of the `Sales` collection.
- The `Sales` collection is filtered using `WHERE` to include only sales records where:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures the sales are from the year 2023.
    - `(MONTH(sale_date) >= 1) & (MONTH(sale_date) <= 3)` ensures the sales are from the first quarter (January, February, or March).

1.  Filter all sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Revenue for each sale is `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. The cost for each sale is `car.cost`.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The query will first calculate the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` from the `Sales` collection, filtering by the `sale_date`. Then, it will use these aggregated values to compute the `gpm_2023`.

Explanation:
1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  `total_revenue_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: Accesses the sale price for each of these sales.
    *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these sale prices, giving the total revenue for 2023.
3.  `total_cost_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale, it accesses the related car (`.car`) and then its cost (`.cost`).
    *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these costs, giving the total cost of goods sold for 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=IFF(...))`: This second `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`.
5.  `gpm_2023=IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0)`:
    *   This calculates the GPM using the formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
    *   `IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, ...)`: This is a conditional check to prevent division by zero. If `total_cost_2023` is zero, GPM is set to 0 (or you might choose `None` or another indicator depending on business rules for such cases). Otherwise, the GPM is calculated.
    *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point division.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to find those where the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`) has an inventory record in `InventorySnapshots` showing it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the same date as the sale (`InventorySnapshots.snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`). We use the `HAS` function to check for the existence of such an inventory snapshot.
3.  From this filtered list of sales, identify the one with the highest `sale_price` using the `TOP_K` function.
4.  For this top sale, extract the car's `make`, `model` (from `Sales.car.make` and `Sales.car.model`), and the `sale_price`.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`:
    *   We start by querying the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1` checks if for each sale, its associated car (`car`) has at least one record in its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that meets the specified criteria.
    *   The inner `WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))` filters the `inventory_snapshots`.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False` ensures the snapshot records when the car went out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date` ensures this happened on the same day as the `sale_date` of the current `Sales` record.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the filtered sales (those that occurred on the day the car went out of inventory).
    *   It selects the top 1 sale, ordered by `sale_price` in descending order (`DESC()`), effectively finding the sale with the highest price.

3.  `.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`:
    *   For the single sale record resulting from `TOP_K`, this `CALCULATE` clause selects the desired fields:

The result should include all months present in the data, ordered chronologically.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Extract Year and Month**:
    First, we process the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, we extract the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions. These are stored as `pay_year` and `pay_month`.

2.  **Group by Month and Calculate Monthly Totals**:
    The `payments_info` collection (containing `pay_year`, `pay_month` for each payment) is then partitioned by `pay_year` and `pay_month`. This creates groups for each unique year-month combination present in the data.
    For each group, we calculate:
    *   `year_of_payment`: The year of the payment group.
    *   `month_of_payment`: The month of the payment group.
    *   `total_payments_this_month`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values from `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into the current year-month group. This gives the total payments for that specific month.

3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    On the `monthly_payment_summary` (which contains total payments for each month), we perform further calculations:
    *   `previous_month_total_payments`: We use the `PREV()` window function to get the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding month. The `by=(year_of_payment.ASC(), month_of_payment.ASC())` clause ensures that ""previous"" is determined chronologically. A `default=0.0` is provided for the `PREV` function; this means for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the `previous_month_total_payments` will be 0.0.
    *   `month_over_month_change`: This is calculated as `total_payments_this_month - previous_month_total_payments`, adhering to the specified definition.

4.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the results are ordered by `year_of_payment` and then `month_of_payment` in ascending order to present a chronological view of monthly payments and their MoM changes.

The query will include entries for all year-month combinations for which there is at least one payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` table. If a month has no payment records, it will not appear in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. `HAS(sales_made) == 1` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (list of sales for that salesperson) is not empty.

2.  `.CALCULATE(calc_first_name=first_name, calc_last_name=last_name, calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))`: For each salesperson who has made sales:
    *   `calc_first_name=first_name` and `calc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's first and last names, storing them in temporary variables `calc_first_name` and `calc_last_name`.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP).
        *   `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` sums the `sale_price` of all sales made by the salesperson.
        *   `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
        *   The result is stored in the `calculated_asp` field.

3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the 5 salespersons with the highest `total_sales_amount`. The sorting will be in descending order, and any NULL values for total sales will be placed last, as requested.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to format the output, renaming the fields to `ID`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `total_sales_amount` as specified.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson, we calculate:
    *   `temp_id = _id`: The salesperson's ID.
    *   `temp_first_name = first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
    *   `temp_last_name = last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
    *   `temp_total_sales = SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: The total sales amount for the salesperson. `sales_made` is a sub-collection of sales records linked to the salesperson, and `sale_price` is a field within each sale record. `SUM()` aggregates these prices.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=temp_total_sales.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Sorts the salespersons by `temp_total_sales` in descending order (`DESC`). `na_pos='last'` ensures that if any salesperson has a NULL total sales amount, they are placed at the end of the sorted list (and thus are unlikely to be in the top 5).

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step selects the required fields and renames them as per the request for the output.

4.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 3 payment methods, ordered by the `total_payment_amount` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""payment_method_groups"", by=(payment_method))`: This groups all records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection by their `payment_method`. Each group is named `payment_method_groups` internally, though this name is not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for the partitioning key.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION` function.
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` (the partitioning key).
    *   `total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts the number of payment records within each `payment_method` group.
    *   `total_payment_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Sums the `payment_amount` for all payments within each `payment_method` group.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_payment_amount.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 records (payment methods) from the result of the `CALCULATE` operation, based on the `total_payment_amount` in descending order.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",44.19288921356201,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(state_name=state, total_signups=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   For each group (i.e., for each unique state) created by the `PARTITION`:

If a salesperson has not been terminated (i.e., `termination_date` is null), `DATEDIFF` is assumed to return a null value for the duration.
3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the single salesperson (k=1) with the minimum employment duration. The `.ASC()` method used for sorting durations will place null durations (for unterminated employees) last by default, ensuring we only consider terminated employees with actual employment durations.

**Explanation:**

1.  `salespersons_employment_info = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:

        *   `s_last_name`: Stores the salesperson's `last_name`.
        *   `s_phone`: Stores the salesperson's `phone` number.
        *   `employment_duration_days`: Calculates the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`. If `termination_date` is null (meaning the salesperson is still employed), this duration is expected to be null.

2.  `shortest_employed_salesperson = salespersons_employment_info.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `salespersons_employment_info` collection.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`: This function selects the top 1 salesperson. The selection is ordered by `employment_duration_days` in ascending order (`ASC()`). Crucially, if `employment_duration_days` is null (e.g., for salespersons not yet terminated), `ASC()` places these nulls at the end of the sort order by default. This ensures that the ""top 1"" will be the salesperson with the smallest actual (non-null) employment duration.
    *   `.CALCULATE(first_name=s_first_name, last_name=s_last_name, phone=s_phone, days_employed=employment_duration_days)`: After selecting the salesperson with the shortest employment, this `CALCULATE` clause formats the output to include:

1.  **Calculate Date Boundaries**: Determine the start and end dates of the ""previous ISO week"". An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday. The ""previous ISO week"" is the full week immediately preceding the current week. We'll use `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` to find the start of the current week, and then adjust by `-7 days` for the start of the previous week and `-1 day` for the end of the previous week. This assumes that the `start of week` configuration in PyDough aligns with Monday, as per ISO 8601 standards.
2.  **Filter Payments**: Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated boundaries of the previous ISO week.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For the filtered payments, we'll create fields to be used as keys for partitioning:
    *   A `payment_day_key` by truncating the `payment_date` to its day component (e.g., using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`).
    *   A `payment_method_key` directly from the `payment_method` field.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: Partition the prepared payment records by `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`. For each resulting group (i.e., for each unique day and payment method combination within the previous week), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.
5.  **Format Output**: The final result will show the specific day, the payment method, and the total amount received for that day and method.

```python
# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.
# We assume DATETIME(..., 'start of week') considers Monday as the start of the week,
# aligning with ISO 8601 week definition.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries_calc`: This initial `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` collection determines the `previous_iso_week_start_date` (Monday of the previous week) and `previous_iso_week_end_date` (Sunday of the previous week). This relies on `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` correctly identifying the start of the current week, and assumes it aligns with ISO standards (Monday start).
2.  `payments_in_previous_week_prepared`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated `previous_iso_week_start_date` and `previous_iso_week_end_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` prepares two new fields:
        *   `payment_day_key`: This truncates the `payment_date` to the start of its day, allowing us to group payments by the specific calendar day.
        *   `payment_method_key`: This is simply the `payment_method` and will be used for grouping.
3.  `daily_payments_by_method`: This is the core of the aggregation.
    *   We `PARTITION` the `payments_in_previous_week_prepared` collection. The `by` clause uses `payment_day_key` and `payment_method_key`, effectively creating groups for each unique combination of day and payment method within the previous week.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` operates on these partitions:
        *   `payment_date`: Takes the value of `payment_day_key` for the output.
        *   `payment_method`: Takes the value of `payment_method_key` for the output.
        *   `total_daily_amount`: Calculates the `SUM` of `payment_amount` from the original `PaymentsReceived` collection, but summed only for the records belonging to the current partition (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
4.  `result`: The variable `result` holds the final dataset, where each row represents a unique day and payment method from the previous ISO week, along with the total payment amount received for that combination.",55.596760749816895,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the previous ISO week.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  For these sales, calculate two key attributes that will be used for grouping:
    *   `c_state_key`: The state of the customer who made the purchase, obtained from `Sales.customer.state`.
    *   `q_start_date_key`: A string representing the first date of the quarter in which the sale occurred. This is constructed by:
        *   Determining the year (which is 2023).
        *   Determining the first month of the quarter (1 for Q1, 4 for Q2, 7 for Q3, 10 for Q4) based on `MONTH(sale_date)`.
        *   Formatting this month number with leading zero if necessary (e.g., ""01"", ""04"", ""07"", ""10"") using `LPAD`.
        *   Joining the year, formatted month, and ""01"" (for the day) with hyphens to form a date string like ""2023-01-01"".
3.  The original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records is implicitly carried forward with these calculated attributes.
4.  Partition the resulting records by `c_state_key` (customer's state) and `q_start_date_key` (quarter start date).
5.  For each group (i.e., each unique combination of customer state and quarter start date), calculate the `total_sales_output` by summing the `sale_price` of all sales falling into that group.
6.  The final result will include the customer's state (`customer_state_output`), the quarter representation (`quarter_representation_output`), and the calculated total sales (`total_sales_output`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_prepared = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, we define two new fields for each of these sales records:
        *   `c_state_key`: This captures the `state` of the `customer` associated with the sale.
        *   `q_start_date_key`: This constructs a string representing the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`.
            *   `YEAR(sale_date)` provides the year (2023).
            *   The nested `IFF(ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), ...), ...)` statements determine the first month of the quarter (1 for Jan-Mar, 4 for Apr-Jun, 7 for Jul-Sep, 10 for Oct-Dec).
            *   `LPAD(..., 2, ""0"")` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"", ""04"", ""07"", ""10"").
            *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ..., ""01"")` combines these parts into a date string like ""2023-01-01"".
    *   The original `sale_price` field from the `Sales` records is carried over implicitly.

2.  `result = sales_prepared.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_prepared` data. The `by=(c_state_key, q_start_date_key)` clause groups the records by unique combinations of customer state and the calculated quarter start date.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these groups:
        *   `customer_state_output=c_state_key`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_representation_output=q_start_date_key`: Selects the quarter start date string for the group.
        *   `total_sales_output=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group (i.e., for that specific state and quarter). This gives the total quarterly sales for that group.

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by operating on the top-level `Dealership` collection to determine a global value: the latest snapshot date in March 2023.
    *   `MAX(InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).snapshot_date)`: This part filters all `InventorySnapshots` to include only those where the `snapshot_date` falls in March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) of the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). From these filtered snapshots, it selects the maximum `snapshot_date`.
    *   This maximum date is then assigned to a new field `latest_date_in_march_2023`. `latest_snapshot_info` becomes a collection with a single row containing this calculated date.

2.  `result = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).car.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection within the context of `latest_snapshot_info`. This makes the `latest_date_in_march_2023` field available for filtering.
    *   `.WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: This filters the `InventorySnapshots` to keep only those records where:
        *   `snapshot_date` is equal to the `latest_date_in_march_2023` (the latest snapshot date we found for March 2023).
        *   `is_in_inventory` is `True` (meaning the car was in inventory for that snapshot).
    *   `.car`: For each snapshot that meets the criteria, we navigate to the related `car` record.
    *   `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`: Finally, for each selected car, we retrieve its `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`, as requested.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection. For each drug, we will calculate its name and its average Defined Daily Dose (DDD).

2.  **`drug_name = drug_name`**: This selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection to be included in the output.

3.  **`average_ddd_value = AVG(...)`**: This calculates the average DDD for each drug. The `AVG` function aggregates DDD values calculated from the drug's associated treatments.

4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: This accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.

5.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total days of treatment is a positive value. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the duration of the treatment in full days. This condition prevents division by zero (if duration is 0) or illogical negative DDDs (if duration is negative).

6.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_ddd = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD:
    *   `tot_drug_amt`: Represents the ""total drug amount consumed during one treatment"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: Represents the ""total days of treatment"".
    *   The result is named `treatment_ddd`.

7.  **`.treatment_ddd`**: After calculating `treatment_ddd` for all valid treatments of a drug, this expression provides these individual DDD values to the `AVG` function.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name` and its corresponding `average_ddd_value`. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria (e.g., all treatments have null end dates or non-positive durations), its `average_ddd_value` will likely be null.",41.77848744392395,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Augment Treatment Data**: For each treatment, we'll calculate two helper fields:
    *   `calc_treatment_month_start_date`: The first day of the month in which the treatment started. This will be used for date-based filtering.
    *   `calc_month_label`: A string representation of the treatment's month and year (e.g., ""YYYY-MM""). This will be used for grouping and as the output month identifier.

2.  **Filter for Relevant Period**: We'll define the time window as the last three full months, excluding the current month. Treatments falling within this window will be selected using `calc_treatment_month_start_date`.
    *   The start of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')`.
    *   The end of this window is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (exclusive).

3.  **Group by Month**: The filtered treatments will be partitioned by `calc_month_label`.

4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month group:
    *   `total_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among all treatments in that month.
    *   `biologic_drug_distinct_patient_count`: Count the number of unique `patient_id`s among treatments in that month where the `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.

-   `Patients.WHERE(...)`: This accesses the `Patients` collection and filters its records.
-   `(ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"")) | (ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com""))`: This is the filtering condition.
    -   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"")`: Checks if the `email` field of a patient ends with ""@gmail.com"".
    -   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")`: Checks if the `email` field of a patient ends with ""@yahoo.com"".
    -   `|`: This is the logical OR operator, so the condition is true if the email ends with either ""@gmail.com"" or ""@yahoo.com"".

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
2.  **`num_patients_psoriasis_biologic=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_patients_psoriasis_biologic` which will hold the count of patients meeting the criteria.
3.  **`DermTreatment.Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` sub-collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition for each patient.
    *   **`treatments_received.WHERE(...)`**: For each patient, we look at their `treatments_received`. We then filter these treatments.
    *   **`(treatments_received.diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`**: This condition checks if the diagnosis associated with the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'. We navigate from the treatment to its linked `diagnosis` record and then to its `diag_name` field.
    *   **`& (treatments_received.drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')`**: This condition checks if the drug used in the treatment is of type 'Biologic'. We navigate from the treatment to its linked `drug` record and then to its `drug_type` field.
    *   The `HAS(...) == 1` part ensures that the patient is included only if they have at least one treatment record that satisfies both specified conditions (diagnosed with 'Psoriasis vulgaris' AND treated with a 'Biologic' drug).
5.  **`COUNT(...)`**: After filtering the `Patients` collection to include only those who meet the criteria, `COUNT` gives the total number of such distinct patients.",18.31318736076355,"count_specific_patients = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:

For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` would be July 1st, 2024. Subtracting 6 months gives January 1st, 2024. Treatments on or after this date are included.

2.  **Filter Patients**:
    *   `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This selects all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".

3.  **Access and Filter Treatments**:
    *   `.treatments_received`: For the selected patient(s), this accesses their list of treatments.

    *   `drug_type == ""topical""`: We check if the `drug_type` field in the linked `Drugs` record is ""topical"".
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to select and rename the specific fields required in the output:

1.  First, for each doctor, we calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by navigating from the `Doctors` collection to their `prescribed_treatments`, then to the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique `drug_id`s. We also select the doctor's ID and specialty, using intermediate names for clarity and potential renaming.
2.  Next, we partition this collection of doctors (now with their distinct drug counts) by their specialty. This creates groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  Finally, for the doctors within each specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed (in descending order, so more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures this ranking is done independently for each specialty. We also format the output fields to match the requested names (`doc_id`, `specialty`, `number_of_distinct_drugs`, `SDRSDR`).

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor.
# We select doc_id (as doc_id_val), speciality (as speciality_val),

)
```

**Explanation:**

The query is designed to provide a ranked list of doctors based on the diversity of drugs they prescribe, with the ranking performed within each medical specialty.

1.  **`doctors_with_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Doctors` collection.

    *   `num_distinct_drugs_val=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: This calculates the number of unique drugs prescribed by each doctor. It navigates through `prescribed_treatments` (a list of treatments for the doctor), then to the `drug` for each treatment, and finally to the `drug_id` of that drug. `NDISTINCT` counts the unique `drug_id`s. If a doctor has prescribed no drugs, this count will be 0.

2.  **`specialty_partition = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection (where each doctor now has their distinct drug count).
    *   `name=""specialty_group_partition""`: Names the resulting partition structure.
    *   `by=(speciality_val)`: Groups the doctors based on their `speciality_val`. All doctors with the same specialty will be in the same group within this partition.

3.  **`result = specialty_partition.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `specialty_partition.Doctors`: This accesses the individual doctor records within each group of the partition created in the previous step.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the final output fields for each doctor:
        *   `doc_id=doc_id_val`: Assigns the doctor's ID to the output field `doc_id`.
        *   `specialty=speciality_val`: Assigns the doctor's specialty to the output field `specialty`. Note the change in spelling from the database field `speciality` to the requested `specialty`.
        *   `number_of_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs_val`: Assigns the count of distinct drugs to `number_of_distinct_drugs`.
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC(), per=""specialty_group_partition"", allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
            *   `by=num_distinct_drugs_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the number of distinct drugs, in descending order (doctors prescribing more unique drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., Rank 1).
            *   `per=""specialty_group_partition""`: Crucially, this ensures that the ranking is performed *within* each specialty group. A doctor's rank is relative to other doctors in the same specialty.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple doctors within the same specialty have prescribed the same number of distinct drugs, they will receive the same rank.

2.  Prepare Treatment Data: For each treatment, truncate its `start_dt` to the beginning of the month. This will be used for grouping.
3.  Filter Treatments: Select only those treatments whose truncated `start_dt` falls within our 12-month window.

**Explanation:**

1.  `time_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by defining two key date boundaries at the highest level (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `calc_current_month_start`: The first day of the current month (e.g., if today is 2023-07-15, this will be 2023-07-01).
    *   `calc_twelve_months_ago_start`: The first day of the month that was 12 months before `calc_current_month_start` (e.g., 2022-07-01).
2.  `treatments_prepared = time_boundaries.Treatments.CALCULATE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection. For each treatment, we calculate `calc_treatment_month` by truncating its `start_dt` to the first day of its month. This allows for monthly aggregation.
3.  `filtered_treatments_by_date = treatments_prepared.WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments to keep only those whose `calc_treatment_month` falls within our target 12-month period. This period starts from `calc_twelve_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and ends just before `calc_current_month_start` (exclusive), effectively giving us 12 full months prior to the current month.
4.  `monthly_metrics_calc = filtered_treatments_by_date.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `filtered_treatments_by_date` by `calc_treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month.
    *   Within each monthly group, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `report_month`: The month for which the metrics are calculated (this is the `calc_treatment_month` partition key).
        *   `PMPD_val`: Per Month Patient Diagnoses, calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id`s in that month's treatments. This counts how many unique patients received at least one diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
        *   `PMTC_val`: Per Month Treatment Count, calculated as the total count of `Treatments` in that month.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(report_month.ASC())` ensures the results are sorted chronologically.

What is the average weight in kg of patients treated with the drug named 'Drugalin'?

avg_weight_for_drugalin_patients = Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin').treatments_used_in.patient.CALCULATE(average_patient_weight_kg=AVG(weight_kg))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin')`**: This part of the query starts by accessing the `Drugs` collection and filters it to find the drug record where the `drug_name` is 'Drugalin'.

2.  **`.treatments_used_in`**: From the filtered drug (Drugalin), this accesses the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which lists all treatments where Drugalin was used.

3.  **`.patient`**: For each treatment in the `treatments_used_in` list, this navigates to the linked `patient` record. This results in a collection of all patients who have received Drugalin.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(average_patient_weight_kg=AVG(weight_kg))`**: Finally, this applies a `CALCULATE` operation on the collection of patients who received Drugalin.
    *   `AVG(weight_kg)`: This aggregation function calculates the average of the `weight_kg` field for all patients in the collection.
    *   `average_patient_weight_kg=...`: The calculated average weight is assigned to a new field named `average_patient_weight_kg`.

The query will return a collection containing a single row and a single column (`average_patient_weight_kg`), which holds the average weight of patients treated with 'Drugalin'. If no patients were treated with 'Drugalin', or if their weights are not available, the `AVG` function might return null, depending on its behavior with empty or null datasets.",28.3236186504364,avg_weight_for_drugalin_patients = Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin').treatments_used_in.patient.CALCULATE(average_patient_weight_kg=AVG(weight_kg)),"cache_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=18407)] cached_content_token_count=18407 candidates_token_count=396 candidates_tokens_details=None prompt_token_count=19834 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=19834)] thoughts_token_count=2270 tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=22500 traffic_type=None"
What is the CAW for male patientsCAW = cohort average weight in kilograms,SELECT AVG(weight_kg) AS caw FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male';,DermTreatment,"Okay, I can help you with that. The ""cohort average weight in kilograms"" (CAW) for male patients can be calculated by filtering the `Patients` collection for males and then computing the average of their `weight_kg`.

male_patients_cohort = Patients.WHERE(gender == ""Male"")
caw_for_male_patients = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    caw_male_patients_kg = AVG(male_patients_cohort.weight_kg)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`male_patients_cohort = Patients.WHERE(gender == ""Male"")`**:
    *   This line first accesses the `Patients` collection.
    *   It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these patients, keeping only those where the `gender` field is equal to ""Male"".
    *   The result is a sub-collection of male patients, assigned to the variable `male_patients_cohort`.

2.  **`caw_for_male_patients = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want to calculate a single aggregate value.
    *   `CALCULATE(caw_male_patients_kg = AVG(male_patients_cohort.weight_kg))` computes a new field named `caw_male_patients_kg`.
    *   `AVG(male_patients_cohort.weight_kg)` calculates the average of the `weight_kg` field for all patients within the `male_patients_cohort` (which we defined in the previous step).

1.  Filter the `Outcomes` collection to include only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. This ensures that we only consider outcomes with complete data for these two timepoints.
2.  From this filtered set of outcomes, calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` and the average `day100_pasi_score` across all relevant treatments.
3.  Apply the D7D100PIR formula: `(avg_day100_pasi - avg_day7_pasi) / avg_day7_pasi * 100.0`.

The final result should be a single percentage value.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))`
    *   This line filters the `Outcomes` collection.
    *   It keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. This resulting collection, `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`, is used for subsequent average calculations.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`
    *   We start a calculation at the `DermTreatment` (the main graph) level to compute overall aggregate values.
    *   `avg_overall_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.
    *   `avg_overall_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi` collection.

3.  `.CALCULATE(d7d100pir_value = ...)`
    *   This chained `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step.
    *   `d7d100pir_value = (avg_overall_day100_pasi - avg_overall_day7_pasi) / avg_overall_day7_pasi * 100.0`: This line applies the D7D100PIR formula. The result is named `d7d100pir_value`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

The final `result` will be a collection with a single row and a single column `d7d100pir_value`, containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want to calculate a single aggregated value (the count of specific patients).
2.  **`pic_female_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `pic_female_patients` which will hold the result of our count.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Female"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`**:

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have prescribed at least one treatment involving a 'biologic' drug. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `prescribed_treatments` for each doctor.
    *   For each treatment, accessing the linked `drug`.
    *   Checking if the `drug_type` of that drug is 'biologic'.
    *   Using the `HAS` function to ensure that the doctor has at least one such treatment.
3.  Once we have the filtered list of doctors, we need to get their unique states (`loc_state`).
4.  We can achieve this by partitioning the filtered doctors by their `loc_state`.
5.  Finally, select the `loc_state` from each partition, which will give us the distinct states.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'biologic')) == 1)`:
    *   This part starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'biologic')` checks each doctor's prescribed treatments and, for each treatment, looks at the associated `drug` to see if its `drug_type` is 'biologic'. This results in a sub-collection of treatments (for that doctor) that used biologic drugs.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1` ensures that only doctors for whom this sub-collection is not empty (i.e., they have prescribed at least one biologic drug) are kept.

2.  `.PARTITION(name=""unique_doctor_states"", by=(loc_state))`:

2.  Partition the patients by their `ins_type`. This creates groups for each insurance type.
3.  For each insurance type group:
    a.  Calculate `avg_pasi_score_d100`:

2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `prescribed_treatments` is a sub-collection within `Doctors` representing all treatments prescribed by a doctor.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` checks if this sub-collection is not empty (i.e., the doctor has prescribed at least one treatment).
    *   `== 1` completes the condition, ensuring we only keep doctors who have prescribed one or more treatments.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_id=doc_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**: This selects the specified fields for the doctors who met the filter criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients`**: We start with the `Patients` collection, which contains all patient records.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records) == 1)`**: This filters the patients.
    *   `treatments_received`: This accesses the list of treatments associated with each patient.
    *   `outcome_records`: For each treatment in `treatments_received`, this accesses the list of outcome records.
    *   `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records)`: This function checks if there is at least one outcome record across all treatments for a given patient. It returns `True` (or 1) if outcome assessments exist, and `False` (or 0) otherwise.
    *   `== 1`: This ensures we only keep patients for whom `HAS(...)` is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id = patient_id, first_name = first_name, last_name = last_name)`**: This step selects the specified fields for the patients who met the filter criteria.
    *   `patient_id = patient_id`: Selects the patient's ID.
    *   `first_name = first_name`: Selects the patient's first name.
    *   `last_name = last_name`: Selects the patient's last name.

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these patients.
    *   `HASNOT(treatments_received) == 1` checks if the `treatments_received` sub-collection for each patient is empty. `HASNOT` returns `True` (or `1` in PyDough's boolean context) if the sub-collection has no records, indicating the patient has not received any treatments.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(patient_id=patient_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**:

2.  Filter these diagnoses to include only those that have associated treatments with outcome records where `day100_itch_vas` is recorded (i.e., not null).
3.  For each of these filtered diagnoses, calculate:
    a.  `diag_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis.
    b.  `max_itch_score_val`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` found among all outcome records linked to treatments for this diagnosis.
    c.  `num_patients_val`: The number of distinct patients who have a recorded `day100_itch_vas` score for treatments associated with this diagnosis. This ensures the patient count is relevant to the itch score context.
4.  Use `TOP_K(3, ...)` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking will be primarily by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order, and secondarily by `num_patients_val` in descending order (to resolve ties in itch score).

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Diagnoses` collection. The `HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider diagnoses for which there is at least one treatment leading to an outcome where the `day100_itch_vas` score is recorded (not null).
2.  `CALCULATE(...)`: For each diagnosis that passes the filter:
    *   `diag_name_val=diag_name`: Stores the diagnosis name.
    *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the highest `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function aggregates scores from the `outcome_records` sub-collection, which are linked via `treatments_for`.
    *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None).treatment.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients. This path navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments (`treatments_for`), then to the outcomes of those treatments (`outcome_records`), filters these outcomes to those with a recorded `day100_itch_vas`, then links back from each such outcome to its parent treatment (`.treatment`), then to the patient associated with that treatment (`.patient`), and finally gets the `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique patient IDs. This ensures the patient count is specific to those contributing to the `day100_itch_vas` data for the diagnosis.
3.  `TOP_K(3, by=(max_itch_score_val.DESC(), num_patients_val.DESC()))`: This selects the top 3 diagnoses. They are ordered first by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). If there's a tie in scores, `num_patients_val` (also descending) is used as a tie-breaker.

1.  **Date Range Definition**:

    *   `end_date_limit = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '+1 month')`: This calculates the first day of the calendar month immediately following the current month. For instance, if the current month is July, this will be August 1st.
    *   The treatments will be filtered for `start_dt` between `start_date_limit` (inclusive) and `end_date_limit` (exclusive), effectively covering the last 6 full calendar months including the current one.

2.  **Initial Data Preparation (`filtered_treatments_with_specialty`)**:
    *   The query starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE(doc_specialty_field = doctor.speciality)`: It first accesses the related `doctor` for each treatment and retrieves their `speciality`, storing it in a new field `doc_specialty_field`. This is necessary because `PARTITION` requires its `by` keys to be direct fields of the collection being partitioned.
    *   `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_date_limit) & (start_dt < end_date_limit))`: It then filters these treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the calculated 6-month window.

3.  **Partitioning by Specialty (`partitioned_by_specialty`)**:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty_field))`: The filtered treatments are grouped (partitioned) by the `doc_specialty_field`. Each group, named `specialty_group`, contains all treatments prescribed by doctors of a particular specialty within the specified timeframe.

4.  **Aggregation per Specialty (`specialty_aggregates`)**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each specialty group created by the partition:
        *   `specialty = doc_specialty_field`: The specialty name is taken directly from the partition key.
        *   `num_treatments = COUNT(Treatments)`: The total number of treatments within that specialty group is counted. `Treatments` here refers to the records from the original `Treatments` collection that fall into the current partition group.
        *   `total_drug_amount = SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: The total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) for all treatments within that specialty group is summed up.

5.  **Selecting Top 3 (`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`)**:
    *   `.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())`: From the aggregated results per specialty, this selects the top 3 specialties based on the `total_drug_amount`, ordered in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   The query starts with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function is used to compute new fields for each drug:
        *   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the `drug_name`.
        *   `number_of_treatments=COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Calculates the total number of treatments associated with each drug by counting the records in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
        *   `average_drug_amount=AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`: Calculates the average total drug amount for each drug by averaging the `tot_drug_amt` field from its associated treatments in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.

2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_treatments.DESC())`**:
    *   After calculating the above fields, `TOP_K` is applied to the resulting collection.
    *   `5`: This specifies that we want the top 5 drugs.
    *   `by=number_of_treatments.DESC()`: This sorts the drugs in descending order based on the `number_of_treatments` calculated in the previous step. This means drugs with more treatments will rank higher.

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"To determine the number of treatments meeting the specified criteria, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three main conditions:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. This will be checked case-insensitively using `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with wildcards (`%psoriasis%`).
    *   **Drug Condition**: The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We'll infer this by checking if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field in the `Drugs` collection (accessed via `Treatments.drug`) exists and is not null using `HAS()`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The treatment must have an `end_dt` that falls within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). We also ensure `end_dt` exists using `HAS()`.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the top `DermTreatment` level.

```python
# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)

)

# Calculate the total number of such treatments
count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions within the `WHERE` clause must be true for a treatment to be included.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition checks the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with each treatment. `LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name)` converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')` then checks if this lowercase name contains ""psoriasis"" anywhere within it (due to the `%` wildcards).
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition verifies that the `drug` used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function returns true if the field exists and is not null, which we interpret as the drug being FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded before attempting date comparisons.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current moment. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` is on or before the current moment, meaning it has indeed ended.

2.  `count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`: This calculates the total number of treatments present in the `filtered_treatments` collection and assigns this count to a new field named `num_treatments`. The result will be a collection with a single row and a single column containing the desired count.",31.389649629592896,"# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date

1.  **Determine the Target Registration Year**: We calculate the year corresponding to ""2 years ago"" by subtracting 2 from the current year, obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`.
2.  **Filter Doctors**: We select doctors from the `Doctors` collection whose `year_reg` matches this target year. We also ensure these doctors have at least one prescribed treatment using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`.
3.  **Identify the First Treatment**: For each selected doctor, we need to find their earliest prescribed treatment.
    *   We access the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection.
    *   We use the `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)` function to rank treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `per=""Doctors""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each doctor. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single treatment is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date (though the specific tie-breaking rule is implicit).
    *   We filter for the treatment where this rank is 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR()` is then used to convert the resulting single-item collection into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields.
4.  **Select and Rename Fields**: We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`, and from their first treatment, the `start_dt` (as `first_treatment_date`) and `treatment_id` (as `first_treatment_id_val`). We interpret ""treatment _id"" as the `treatment_id` field from the `Treatments` collection, as it's the primary identifier for treatments.

    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This is a crucial condition. It checks if the current treatment has at least one record in its `concomitant_meds` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause.
        *   The inner `WHERE` clause `(concomitant_meds.start_dt >= start_dt) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, concomitant_meds.start_dt) <= 14)` filters concomitant medications.
            *   `concomitant_meds.start_dt >= start_dt`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date (`start_dt` here refers to `Treatments.start_dt`).
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, concomitant_meds.start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started within 14 days (2 weeks) of the treatment's start date. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days.

2.  **`result = qualifying_treatments.concomitant_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Once we have the `qualifying_treatments`, we access their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This means for each qualifying treatment, we will iterate through all its associated concomitant medications.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function then constructs the output rows. For each concomitant medication of a qualifying treatment, it selects:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id`: The ID of the parent treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_dt = treatment.start_dt`: The start date of the parent treatment.

2.  `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the values provided to it.
3.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Male"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only patients who are male and have private insurance.
    *   `gender == ""Male""`: Filters for male patients.
    *   `ins_type == ""Private""`: Filters for patients with private insurance.
    *   `&`: The logical AND operator combines these two conditions.
4.  `.CALCULATE(current_age=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their age.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to compute intermediate values for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name and assigns it to `merchant_name`.
    *   `distinct_coupons_count=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of unique coupons used in successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""SUCCESSFUL"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""SUCCESSFUL"" and have an associated coupon (checked using `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
        *   `.coupon.cid`: Accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the coupon associated with each of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `distinct_transactions_count=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the number of unique successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""SUCCESSFUL"")`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""SUCCESSFUL"".
        *   `.txid`: Accesses the `txid` (transaction ID) of these transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique transaction IDs.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one and computes the final CPUR.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: This ensures `merchant_name` is included in the final output.
    *   `cpur=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(distinct_transactions_count > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This is a conditional expression. If `distinct_transactions_count` is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division. Otherwise (if it's 0, to prevent division by zero), CPUR is set to `0.0`.
        *   `distinct_coupons_count / distinct_transactions_count`: This is the CPUR formula.

1.  **Enhance Notifications Data**: Start with the `Notifications` collection. For each notification, calculate:
    *   The country of the user who received the notification (`usr_country`).
    *   The start date of the week in which the notification was created (`notification_week_start`). This effectively truncates `created_at` to the week.
    *   A flag (`is_weekend_day`) indicating if the notification was created on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Notifications**:
    *   Keep only notifications for users whose country is either 'US' or 'Canada'.
    *   Further filter these notifications to include only those where `notification_week_start` falls within one of the last three weeks, specifically:
        *   The week starting 1 week before the start of the current week.
        *   The week starting 2 weeks before the start of the current week.
        *   The week starting 3 weeks before the start of the current week.
        This excludes the current week as requested.

3.  **Aggregate Weekly Counts**:
    *   Partition the filtered notifications by `notification_week_start`. This groups all relevant notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   For each weekly group, calculate:
        *   `week_starting_on`: The start date of the week (this is the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications_in_week`: The total count of notifications in that week's group.
        *   `weekend_notifications_in_week`: The count of notifications within that group that were sent on a weekend. This is achieved by summing a conditional expression that yields 1 for weekend notifications and 0 otherwise.

result = weekly_notification_counts
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `notifications_enhanced`: We first process the `Notifications` collection. For each notification, we retrieve the `country` of the associated `user`, calculate the `notification_week_start` by truncating its `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week, and determine if it was sent on an `is_weekend_day` (Saturday or Sunday).
2.  `filtered_notifications_by_country_and_week`: This step filters the enhanced notifications. It keeps only those where the `usr_country` is 'US' or 'Canada'. It then further filters based on `notification_week_start`, ensuring that only notifications from the three weeks immediately preceding the current week are included. `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-N weeks')` is used to dynamically identify these past weeks.
3.  `weekly_notification_counts`: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by `notification_week_start`. For each group (i.e., for each of the three relevant past weeks):
    *   `week_starting_on` is the start date of that week.
    *   `total_notifications_in_week` is the total count of notifications sent to US/Canadian users during that week.
    *   `weekend_notifications_in_week` is the count of those notifications that were sent on a weekend. This is calculated by summing 1 for each weekend notification and 0 otherwise, effectively counting only the weekend ones.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and then apply filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   **`(status == ""active"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `status` is ""active"".
    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose `category` is ""retail"". The `LOWER()` function is used on the `category` field to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive, matching ""Retail"", ""retail"", ""RETAIL"", etc.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition filters for merchants who have at least one coupon. The `HAS(coupons)` function returns true (or 1 in PyDough's context for boolean checks in `WHERE`) if the `coupons` sub-collection for a merchant is not empty.
    *   The `&` operator is used to combine these conditions, so a merchant must satisfy all three to be included.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use the `CALCULATE` function to specify the output fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`us_users_recent_transactions = Users.WHERE(country == ""US"").transactions_sent.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Users` collection.
    *   `WHERE(country == ""US"")` filters these users to include only those whose `country` is ""US"".
    *   `.transactions_sent` accesses the transactions sent by these US users.
    *   Another `WHERE` clause is applied to these transactions:
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` filters transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` ensures that transactions from today (0 days diff), yesterday (1 day diff), ..., up to 6 days ago are included, covering a 7-day period.
    *   The result of this expression, `us_users_recent_transactions`, is a collection of transactions meeting these criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_user_balances_updates`: This variable stores records from the `UserBalances` collection that have been updated from 7 days ago up to the current time. The condition `updated_at >= DATETIME('now', '-7 days')` achieves this filtering.
2.  `per_user_average_balance`:
    *   We take `recent_user_balances_updates` and `PARTITION` it by `user_id`. This creates groups of balance records, one group for each unique user who had updates in the last 7 days.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these user-specific groups. `user_avg_bal = AVG(UserBalances.balance)` calculates the average balance for the current user's records within that 7-day period. This value represents the AMB for that specific user.
3.  `result`:
    *   Finally, we use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to compute a global aggregate.
    *   `average_balance = AVG(per_user_average_balance.user_avg_bal)` calculates the average of all the `user_avg_bal` values obtained in the previous step.

        *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (most recent first).
        *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures the ranking is performed independently for each user (i.e., partitioned by user).

This involves summing up the amounts from successfully received transactions for each merchant and then ranking them based on this total revenue.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant**:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we calculate `calculated_revenue`. This is the sum of `amount` from their `transactions_received`.
    *   These transactions are filtered to include only those that are:
        *   Successfully completed (assumed `status == ""COMPLETED""`).
        *   Designated as `receiver_type == 1` (as specified in the prompt, likely indicating the receiver is a merchant).
    *   We also select the merchant's `name` and `category`, renaming them to `m_name` and `m_category` respectively to avoid potential naming conflicts in subsequent steps.
    *   The prompt mentions ""wallet\_transactions\_daily"", which is not in the provided schema. We assume this refers to the `Transactions` collection, which is linked to `Merchants` via `transactions_received`.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Format Output**:
    *   The result from the first step (`merchant_revenue_details`) is a collection where each record contains a merchant's name, category, and their calculated revenue.
    *   We then perform another `CALCULATE` operation on this collection:
        *   The fields `m_name` and `m_category` are renamed to the final output names `merchant_name` and `category`.
        *   `calculated_revenue` is presented as `revenue_amount`. We use `DEFAULT_TO(calculated_revenue, 0.0)` to ensure that if a merchant has no qualifying transactions (resulting in a NULL sum), their revenue is treated as 0.0. This is important for consistent ranking.
        *   `revenue_rank` is computed using the `RANKING()` window function. It ranks merchants based on their `calculated_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1. `DEFAULT_TO` is used here as well to ensure consistent ranking for zero-revenue merchants.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `revenue_rank` in ascending order for easier readability.

This approach interprets ""MRR"" not as traditional ""Monthly Recurring Revenue"" (which would require monthly data grouping) but as ""Merchant Revenue Rank"" based on the total successfully received transaction amounts, as suggested by the prompt's definition and requested output fields.

```python

PMDAU is interpreted as the average of Daily Active Users (DAU) for each month in the specified period.
- A **Daily Active User (DAU)** for a specific day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` from transactions where `sender_type == 0` on that particular day.
- The **PMDAU** for a month is the average of these DAU counts over all days in that month.
- The results are aggregated and presented per month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"").

The calculation involves the following steps:
1.  **Determine Date Range**: Identify the start of the month two months ago and the start of the current month. The transactions considered will be within this range (e.g., if the current month is May, transactions from March 1st up to, but not including, May 1st will be included, covering all of March and April).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that have `sender_type == 0` and fall within the calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Aggregation**: For each relevant transaction, extract:
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation of the year and month (e.g., ""2023-03"") for final monthly grouping.
    *   `day_date`: The date of the transaction, truncated to the start of the day (e.g., ""2023-03-15 00:00:00""), for daily grouping.
    *   `sender_id`: The ID of the sender.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transactions by `year_month_str` and `day_date`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each day), count the number of distinct `sender_id`s. This gives the `dau_count` for that day.
5.  **Calculate PMDAU**:
    *   Group the daily `dau_count`s by `year_month_str`.
    *   For each month, calculate the average of the `dau_count`s. This average is the PMDAU for that month.

Explanation:
1.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration`:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters sessions to include only those starting from `2023-06-01T00:00:00` (inclusive) up to, but not including, `2023-06-08T00:00:00` (exclusive).
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then computes two new attributes for each of these sessions:
        *   `user_id_attr`: This is the `user_id` from the session, which will be used for grouping.
        *   `session_duration_sec_attr`: This is the duration of the individual session in seconds, calculated using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`.

2.  `user_total_durations`:
    *   This step takes the `sessions_in_range_with_duration` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""user_sessions_group"", by=(user_id_attr))` groups the sessions by `user_id_attr`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` clause operates on each group:
        *   `user_id_col = user_id_attr`: Selects the user ID for the output.
        *   `total_duration_col = SUM(sessions_in_range_with_duration.session_duration_sec_attr)`: Calculates the sum of `session_duration_sec_attr` for all sessions within that user's group. This results in the total session duration for that user.

3.  `result`:
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(total_duration_col.DESC())` sorts the `user_total_durations` collection by the `total_duration_col` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.
    *   The `DATEDIFF` function for seconds returns an integer, and the sum of these integers will also be an integer, as requested. The final output will contain the user ID and their total session duration in seconds.",59.48581385612488,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by the specified date range and calculate the duration of each session in seconds.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we are calculating an aggregate value (total count) across a subset of `UserSessions`.
2.  `tuc_count = COUNT(...)`: This defines a new field `tuc_count` which will hold the total number of user sessions.
3.  `UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `UserSessions` collection and apply a filter.
4.  `(session_start_ts >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')) & (session_start_ts <= DATETIME('now'))`: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This function call generates a timestamp representing exactly one month prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function call generates the current timestamp.
    *   The condition filters sessions whose `session_start_ts` is greater than or equal to one month ago and less than or equal to the current moment, effectively covering the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"".
5.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `UserSessions` records that satisfy the `WHERE` clause condition.

1.  **Identify the Previous Month**: We'll use date functions to determine the year and month corresponding to the month immediately preceding the current one.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Select transactions that occurred within this identified previous month.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those of `transaction_type == ""wallet""`.
3.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of these filtered wallet transactions from the previous month.
    *   Count how many of_ these transactions had a `status == ""successful""` (assuming ""successful"" is the status string for successful transactions).
4.  **Calculate STR**: Apply the given formula: `STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions`. We'll express this as a percentage and handle cases where the total number of transactions is zero to avoid division errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date_for_calc = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`: This line calculates the date of the first day of the previous month.
2.  `target_year_for_calc = YEAR(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)` and `target_month_for_calc = MONTH(prev_month_start_date_for_calc)`: These lines extract the year and month from the date calculated in the previous step. These will be used to filter transactions.

    *   `YEAR(created_at) == target_year_for_calc) & (MONTH(created_at) == target_month_for_calc)`: Ensures transactions are from the identified previous month.
    *   `transaction_type == ""wallet""`: Filters for wallet transactions. We assume ""wallet"" is the string used in the `transaction_type` field.
4.  `str_calculation_result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This performs the main calculation at the `Ewallet` (top graph) level, as we need a single aggregate result.
    *   `num_successful_wallet_tx = COUNT(prev_month_wallet_transactions_filtered.WHERE(status == ""successful""))`: Counts the number of successful wallet transactions from the filtered set. We assume ""successful"" is the string in the `status` field indicating success.

    *   `calculated_previous_month_str = IFF(...)`: Calculates the STR.
        *   `IFF(num_total_wallet_tx > 0, ... , 0.0)`: This checks if there were any wallet transactions. If `num_total_wallet_tx` is greater than 0, it calculates STR as `(num_successful_wallet_tx * 100.0) / num_total_wallet_tx` (to get a percentage).
        *   If `num_total_wallet_tx` is 0, STR is set to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the year 2023, were sent by a 'user' (not a merchant), had a 'successful' status, and where the sending user is marked as 'active'. We use `HAS(sending_user) == 1` to ensure the `sending_user` relationship exists before checking its status.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This will be the first day of the month of the transaction, derived using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will serve as our grouping key for months.
    *   `user_id_of_sender`: This will be the `sender_id` from the transaction, representing the user who sent the money.
3.  We then partition these prepared transactions by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
4.  For each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `month_as_date_obj`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (our partition key), representing the month.
    *   `num_distinct_active_senders`: This is the count of distinct `user_id_of_sender` values within that month's group, achieved using `NDISTINCT`. This gives us the number of unique active users who sent money in that month.
5.  Finally, we order the results by `month_as_date_obj` in ascending order to get the counts from the earliest month first.

**Explanation:**

    *   This part of the query starts by accessing the `Notifications` collection.
    *   It then filters these notifications using the `WHERE` clause to include only those where the `notification_type` field is equal to `'transaction'`. This assumes that 'transaction' is the specific string value used to denote transaction-related notifications.

2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""distinct_transaction_notification_users"", by=user_id)`**:
    *   The filtered notifications are then partitioned.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""distinct_transaction_notification_users"", by=user_id)` groups the records by the `user_id` field. This effectively creates a group for each unique `user_id` that has received a transaction notification.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(user_id=user_id)`**:

    *   It partitions these transactions using `PARTITION(name=""transactions_grouped_by_country"", by=(sender_user_country_attr))`. This groups the transactions by the `sender_user_country_attr`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., for each country):
        *   `country = sender_user_country_attr`:  Selects the country name (which was the partition key).
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within that country group. It refers to the `amount` field of the original `Transactions` records that fall into this partition.

3.  For this filtered set of merchants, access their associated wallet balances from the `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `MerchantBalances`).
4.  Calculate the median of these `balance` amounts.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we want to compute a single aggregate value (the median balance).
2.  `todays_median_retail_merchant_balance=...`: This defines the name of the field that will hold our calculated median value.
3.  `MEDIAN(...)`: This aggregation function calculates the median of the numerical values provided to it.
4.  `Merchants.WHERE((status == ""active"") & CONTAINS(category, ""retail""))`:
    *   This part filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == ""active""`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, ""retail"")`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring ""retail"".
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only merchants satisfying both are selected.
5.  `.balances`: After filtering the merchants, `.balances` accesses the `MerchantBalances` records associated with these specific merchants. This will be a collection of balance records.
6.  `.balance`: From these `MerchantBalances` records, `.balance` extracts the actual numerical balance values, resulting in a collection of numbers.
7.  The `MEDIAN` function then computes the median of this collection of balance amounts from the active retail merchants.",34.10252594947815,"result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

2.  Filter the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only those snapshots whose `snapshot_date` matches this determined earliest date in 2023.
3.  For this filtered set of snapshots (which all share the earliest date in 2023), calculate the average of `tx_limit_daily` and the average of `tx_limit_monthly`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection called `session_durations`.

    *   We calculate `duration_seconds` for each session using the `DATEDIFF` function. `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` computes the difference between the session end time and start time in seconds.

2.  **`average_session_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `session_durations` collection (which now includes `duration_seconds`).
    *   We use `PARTITION` to group the sessions.

        *   `by=(device_type)`: This specifies that we want to group the sessions based on their `device_type`.
    *   After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` again on these groups:
        *   We select the `device_type` (which is our partition key).
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_by_device.duration_seconds)`: For each `device_type` group, we calculate the average of the `duration_seconds` values. We access the `duration_seconds` from the partitioned data using `sessions_by_device.duration_seconds` (where `sessions_by_device` is the name we gave to our partition).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We begin by processing the `Users` collection. In this step, we:
    *   Alias `username` to `user_username`, `email` to `user_email`, and `created_at` to `user_signup_date`. This helps in clearly referencing these values later.
    *   Calculate `end_of_first_year_marker`: For each user, this new field stores the timestamp exactly one year after their `created_at` date (sign-up date), using the `DATETIME` function.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0)`: This filters the users based on their notification history.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)`: For each user, this filters their associated `notifications` to include only those created *before* the `end_of_first_year_marker` (i.e., within their first year).
    *   `HAS(...)`: This function checks if the filtered set of notifications (those within the first year) has any records. It returns `1` (True) if there's at least one such notification, and `0` (False) otherwise.
    *   `... == 0`: The overall condition keeps users for whom `HAS(...)` is `0`, meaning they have no notifications that were created within their first year of signing up.
