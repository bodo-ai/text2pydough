**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by selecting the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer who meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"".
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the results (customers with their names and success rates) are ordered by the `success_rate` in ascending order (from lowest to highest).",17.653197050094604,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"".
    *   They must have at least one 'BUY' transaction (`transaction_type == ""BUY""`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. The result will be a single number representing the count of these distinct customers.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_ticker_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple holding the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction that meets the subsequent criteria.
        *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions made by each customer.
        *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""BUY"") & (ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_ticker_symbols)))`: This filters the transactions to include only those where:
            *   `transaction_type == ""BUY""`: The transaction was a purchase.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `join_date >= ""2023-01-01""`: This selects customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023.
        *   `status == ""Active""`: This further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result, `filtered_customers`, is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., the TAC).

2.  **`tac_per_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))` groups these customers by the `country` field. Each group in `country_groups` will contain customers from the same country.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `country=country`: This selects the `country` field for the output. Since `country` was a partitioning key, it can be directly referenced.
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the number of customers within each country group. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the records in the `Customers` sub-collection implicitly available for each partition. This gives us the ""Total Active Customers"" count for that specific country.

The final variable `tac_per_country` will contain a list of records, where each record has the `country` and the corresponding `tac_count` (the number of Total Active Customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023).",21.549594163894653,"# Filter customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023, and whose status is 'Active'.

1.  **Augment Transaction Data**: For each transaction, we'll calculate:
    *   `relative_week_num`: An identifier for the week it belongs to, relative to the current week. `1` will represent last week, `2` the week before last, and so on. This is calculated by finding the difference in weeks between the start of the transaction's week and the start of the current week.
    *   `is_weekend_tx`: A boolean flag indicating if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday.

2.  **Filter Relevant Transactions**: We'll filter these augmented transactions to include only those from the last 8 weeks (i.e., `relative_week_num` from 1 to 8).

3.  **Group and Aggregate**: We'll group the filtered transactions by `relative_week_num` and then, for each week:
    *   Identify the week (using `relative_week_num` and also calculating the actual start date of that week for clarity).
    *   Count the total number of transactions.
    *   Count the number of transactions that occurred on a weekend.

4.  **Order Results**: The results will be ordered from the most recent week (last week, `relative_week_num = 1`) to the oldest of the 8 weeks considered (`relative_week_num = 8`).

It's assumed that all transactions in the `Transactions` table are related to stocks, as they have a `ticker_id` linking them to the `Tickers` table.

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  **`transactions_with_week_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step processes each transaction from the `Transactions` table.
    *   `tx_date_time = date_time`: Preserves the original `date_time` of the transaction.
    *   `relative_week_num = DATEDIFF(""weeks"", DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week'), DATETIME('now', 'start of week'))`: This calculates an integer representing how many full weeks ago the transaction's week occurred relative to the start of the current week. For example, `0` means the transaction was in the current week, `1` means it was last week, `2` means the week before last, and so on.
    *   `is_weekend_tx = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean flag that is `True` if the transaction's `date_time` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.

2.  **`relevant_transactions = transactions_with_week_info.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This filters the augmented transactions to keep only those where `relative_week_num` is between `1` and `8` (inclusive). This effectively selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks immediately preceding the current week.

3.  **`weekly_stock_summary = relevant_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(relative_week_num))`: This groups the `relevant_transactions` based on their `relative_week_num`. Each group will contain all transactions for one specific week out of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = relative_week_num`: This is the numeric identifier for the week (1-8).
        *   `week_start_date = DATETIME(MIN(Transactions.tx_date_time), 'start of week')`: This calculates the actual start date of the respective week by taking the earliest transaction time within that group and truncating it to the start of its week. This provides a more user-friendly representation of the week.
        *   `total_transactions_this_week = COUNT(Transactions)`: This counts the total number of transactions in the current weekly group.
        *   `weekend_transactions_this_week = SUM(IFF(Transactions.is_weekend_tx, 1, 0))`: This counts how many transactions within the current weekly group had the `is_weekend_tx` flag set to `True`. The `IFF` function converts the boolean `is_weekend_tx` to `1` (if true) or `0` (if false), and `SUM` adds these up.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.ASC())`: This sorts the final results by the `week_identifier` in ascending order, so the most recent week (last week, identifier 1) appears first, followed by progressively older weeks up to the 8th week ago.

4.  **`result = weekly_stock_summary`**:
    *   The final result is assigned to the variable `result`. It will contain a table with columns: `week_identifier`, `week_start_date`, `total_transactions_this_week`, and `weekend_transactions_this_week` for each of the last 8 weeks (excluding the current week).",57.02388954162598,"# Step 1: Calculate relative week number and weekend flag for each transaction

1.  **Define Date Boundaries for ""Last Week""**: We use contextless expressions and the `DATETIME` function to define the start of the current week and the start of last week. ""Last week"" is the period from the start of last week (inclusive) up to the start of the current week (exclusive).
    *   `start_of_current_week_expr`: Calculated as the beginning of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_last_week_expr`: Calculated by subtracting 7 days from `start_of_current_week_expr`.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We create a contextless expression `filtered_us_transactions_last_week` that represents the set of transactions meeting all criteria:
    *   The transaction must be associated with a customer whose `country` is ""USA"". This is checked via `customer.country == ""USA""`.
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must be greater than or equal to `start_of_last_week_expr`.
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must be less than `start_of_current_week_expr`.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: We use `Broker.CALCULATE` (the top-level collection) to compute the final aggregates from the `filtered_us_transactions_last_week`:
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of transactions in the filtered set, obtained using `COUNT(filtered_us_transactions_last_week)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions in the filtered set, obtained using `SUM(filtered_us_transactions_last_week.amount)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to compute new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Include the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.
        *   `cr=RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (`cr`). The `RANKING` function is used here:
            *   `by=total_transaction_amount.DESC()`: Ranks customers based on their `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1).

The final `result` will contain the customer's name, their total number of transactions, their total transaction amount, and their rank based on the total transaction amount.",16.89984107017517,"customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This determines the first moment of the current month.
2.  `start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-6 months')`: This calculates the date 6 months before the start of the current month. For example, if ""now"" is in July, this will be the start of January.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and before `start_of_current_month`. This effectively selects customers from the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.
4.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))`: For these filtered customers, we calculate two new fields: `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`, representing the year and month of their `join_date`.
5.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))`: We group the customers based on the unique combinations of `signup_year_val` and `signup_month_val`. Each group (`monthly_group`) will contain all customers who signed up in a specific month.
6.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each `monthly_group`:
    *   `signup_year=signup_year_val, signup_month=signup_month_val`: We select the year and month for the group.
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: We count the number of customers within the current `monthly_group`. `Customers` here refers to the sub-collection of customers belonging to this specific signup month. This gives us the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS).
    *   `pmat=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the average transaction `amount`. `Customers.transactions_made.amount` accesses all transaction amounts for all customers who signed up in this specific month. The `AVG` function then computes their average, giving us the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT). If customers in a particular month have no transactions, `pmat` will be null for that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data**:
    *   `DailyPrices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) < 7)`: This line filters the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days. `< 7` ensures we get data for today (0 days diff) up to 6 days ago.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ttype=ticker.ticker_type, cprice=close)`: For these filtered records, we then calculate two new fields:
        *   `ttype`: This extracts the `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record.
        *   `cprice`: This takes the `close` price from the `DailyPrices` record.
    *   The result of this step is a collection named `daily_prices_filtered` containing `ttype` and `cprice` for each daily price entry in the last 7 days.

2.  **Group by Ticker Type and Calculate Average**:
    *   `daily_prices_filtered.PARTITION(name=""type_groups"", by=(ttype))`: This partitions (groups) the `daily_prices_filtered` collection by the `ttype` (ticker type). Each group in `type_groups` will correspond to a unique ticker type.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ticker_type=ttype, average_closing_price=AVG(daily_prices_filtered.cprice))`: For each partition (i.e., for each `ticker_type`):
        *   `ticker_type=ttype`: We select the `ttype` to be included in the final result.
        *   `average_closing_price=AVG(daily_prices_filtered.cprice)`: We calculate the average of the `cprice` (closing prices) for all records within that specific `ttype` group. This gives the Average Closing Price (ACP) for that ticker type over the last 7 days.

1.  **Filter Customers by Join Year**: Select only customers who joined in the year 2022.
2.  **Determine Transaction Status and Activity Status**: For these selected customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), False otherwise.
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's status is 'Active' (`status == 'Active'`), False otherwise.
3.  **Group by Country**: Partition the customers (with their flags) by their `country`.
4.  **Calculate Counts for AR**: For each country group:
    *   `num_active_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022, are 'Active', AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`.
    *   `num_total_with_transactions`: Count customers who joined in 2022 AND have transactions. This corresponds to `COUNT(customers_in_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: Apply the formula: `AR = (num_active_with_transactions / num_total_with_transactions) * 100.0`. If `num_total_with_transactions` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  **Select Output Fields**: The final result will include the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

# Filter customers who joined in 2022 and calculate necessary flags

        0.0
    )
)

result = activity_ratio_by_country
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_with_flags`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)` filters these customers to include only those who joined in 2022.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then processes these filtered customers to:
        *   Extract the `country` and assign it to `customer_country`.
        *   Create a boolean flag `has_transactions_flag`, which is true if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
        *   Create a boolean flag `is_active_flag`, which is true if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.

2.  `ar_components_by_country`:
    *   This step takes `customers_joined_2022_with_flags` and partitions them by `customer_country` using `PARTITION(name=""customers_in_country_group"", by=(customer_country))`. Each group, named `customers_in_country_group`, contains customers from the same country who joined in 2022, along with their calculated flags.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE(...)` operates on each country group:
        *   `output_country_name = customer_country`: Selects the country name for the group.
        *   `num_active_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(is_active_flag & has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who are both active (`is_active_flag` is true) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the numerator for the AR.
        *   `num_total_with_transactions = COUNT(customers_in_country_group.WHERE(has_transactions_flag))`: Counts customers within the current country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is true). This is the denominator for the AR.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` takes the per-country counts from the previous step.
    *   `country = output_country_name`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio.
        *   It checks if `num_total_with_transactions` is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero.
        *   If it is, AR is calculated as `(num_active_with_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_with_transactions`.
        *   Otherwise (if `num_total_with_transactions` is 0), AR is set to `0.0`.

4.  `result = activity_ratio_by_country`: Assigns the final result to the variable `result`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the top-level `Broker` collection because the final output is a single aggregated value (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers = COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_customers` that will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is applied to the `name` and `state` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name starts with 'j'.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`(... | ...)`**: The OR operator `|` combines the two name conditions, meaning a customer is selected if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
8.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
9.  **`(... & ...)`**: The AND operator `&` combines the name condition (the OR group) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.
10. **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` tallies the number of `Customers` records that satisfy all the specified conditions.",14.847715854644775,"count_of_customers = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  **Prepare Transactions Data**: Access the `Transactions` collection and use `CALCULATE` to make the `ticker.symbol` available as a scalar field (`ticker_symbol_for_partition`). This field will be used for partitioning later. Original transaction fields like `transaction_type`, `date_time`, `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` are carried forward.
2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   Filter for transactions where `transaction_type` is ""sell"".
    *   Filter for transactions where `date_time` is within the last month. This is achieved by checking if `date_time` is greater than or equal to one month ago from the current moment (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`) and less than or equal to the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`).
3.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate**:
    *   Use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions by `ticker_symbol_for_partition`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), use `CALCULATE` to:
        *   Preserve the ticker symbol (renamed to `ticker_symbol_output` for clarity).
        *   Calculate the sum of `amount` (as `total_amount_val`).
        *   Calculate the sum of `tax` (as `total_tax_val`).
        *   Calculate the sum of `commission` (as `total_commission_val`).
        These sums refer to the original fields of the `Transactions` collection within each partition.
4.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, calculate the SPM with another `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   The SPM formula is: `(Total Amount - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`.
    *   To prevent division by zero if `total_amount_val` is 0, an `IFF` condition is used: if `total_amount_val` is 0, SPM is set to 0.0; otherwise, the formula is applied. The result is stored in `spm_value`.
5.  **Final Output**: A final `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `ticker_symbol` and `spm`.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each daily price record, extract the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the year, and the month from the `date`. Create a formatted month-year string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") for display and grouping.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and the formatted month-year string (along with numeric year and month for sorting). Within each group (each ticker-month), calculate:
    *   Average closing price (`AVG(DailyPrices.close)`)
    *   Highest price for the month (`MAX(DailyPrices.high)`)
    *   Lowest price for the month (`MIN(DailyPrices.low)`)
    This results in a new collection where each row represents a specific ticker's performance for a specific month.
3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month Change (MoMC)**:
    *   Take the collection of monthly aggregates from the previous step.
    *   Partition this collection by ticker symbol. This creates groups, where each group contains all monthly records for a single ticker.
    *   Within each ticker's group of monthly records, use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month. The records must be ordered by year and then month for `PREV` to work correctly. The `per` argument of `PREV` will ensure it operates independently for each ticker.
    *   With the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where there is no previous month (first month of data for a ticker) or where the previous month's average closing price is zero to avoid division by zero errors. In such cases, MoMC will be set to `None`.

The final result will include the ticker symbol, month (YYYY-MM), average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.

    *   `min_low_in_range`: The minimum `low_p` observed for that stock within the date range.
5.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, compute `price_change_value` as `max_high_in_range - min_low_in_range`.
6.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_value.DESC())` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest price change.
7.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to ensure the output contains only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `price_change`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_join_details`: This first `CALCULATE` statement iterates through all `Customers`. For each customer, it extracts their `_id` (as `c_id`), `name` (as `c_name`), the `YEAR` of their `join_date` (as `c_join_year`), and the `MONTH` of their `join_date` (as `c_join_month`).
2.  `customer_transactions_in_join_month`: This second `CALCULATE` statement operates on the `customer_join_details` collection. For each customer, it counts their `transactions_made`. The `WHERE` clause within the `COUNT` function filters these transactions to include only those where the transaction's `YEAR(date_time)` matches `c_join_year` and `MONTH(date_time)` matches `c_join_month` (the join year/month calculated in the previous step). The result is stored as `num_txns_in_join_mth`. The `c_id` and `c_name` are passed through.
3.  `top_customer_info`: This uses `TOP_K(1, by=num_txns_in_join_mth.DESC())` to find the single customer who has the highest `num_txns_in_join_mth`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.
4.  `result`: The final `CALCULATE` statement takes the single record from `top_customer_info` and formats it to match the requested output fields: `_id` (from `c_id`), `name` (from `c_name`), and `number_of_transactions` (from `num_txns_in_join_mth`).",45.084200620651245,"# Step 1: For each customer, calculate their join year and month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:

    *   The condition `date_time < '2023-04-01'` includes transactions up to the end of Mar 31, 2023 (i.e., before April 1, 2023).

2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""type_group"", by=(transaction_type))`**:
    *   The filtered transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by the `transaction_type` field.
    *   Each partition `type_group` will contain all transactions of a specific type within the specified date range.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `transaction_type` group created by the `PARTITION` step, this calculates:
        *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`: Selects the transaction type (which is the partition key).

1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records to include only those where the `date` field is greater than or equal to '2023-04-01'.
3.  Group the filtered records by `ticker_id` to ensure distinctness. This can be achieved using the `PARTITION` function.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `DailyPrices.WHERE(date >= ""2023-04-01"")`: This part of the query starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection and then filters it. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those records where the `date` is on or after April 1, 2023. We assume the `date` field can be directly compared with the string ""2023-04-01"".
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""unique_tickers_by_id"", by=(ticker_id))`: After filtering, the `PARTITION` function is used to group the remaining `DailyPrices` records. It groups them by the `ticker_id` field. This effectively creates a group for each unique `ticker_id` present in the filtered data.
3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=ticker_id)`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is applied to the result of the partitioning. For each unique group (representing a distinct `ticker_id`), it selects the `ticker_id` itself. The field `ticker_id` is directly used as it's the partitioning key.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers`**: We start by accessing the `Tickers` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(historical_prices) == 1)`**: This filters the `Tickers` collection.
    *   `historical_prices` is the sub-collection within each `Ticker` record that contains its daily price records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_of) == 1)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Tickers` collection.
    *   Filters the tickers to include only those that have at least one transaction, using `HAS(transactions_of) == 1`. This ensures that calculations for `SUM` and `COUNT` are performed on tickers with actual transaction data.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step calculates new fields for each ticker that passed the filter:
        *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the `symbol` of the ticker and names it `ticker_symbol`.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_of)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each ticker using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_of` sub-collection.
        *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with each ticker using the `SUM` aggregation function.

3.  **`.TOP_K(10, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**:
    *   Takes the result from the `CALCULATE` step.
    *   Sorts the tickers in descending order (`DESC()`) based on the `total_transaction_amount`.
    *   Selects the top 10 tickers from this sorted list.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions that occurred within the last 30 days. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current moment (`'now'`).
2.  For these filtered transactions, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `c_country`: The country of the customer who made the transaction, accessed via `customer.country`.
    *   `t_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
    This results in a temporary collection named `transactions_details`.
3.  We then partition the `transactions_details` collection by `c_country`. This groups all transactions by the customer's country.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country (which is `c_country`).
    *   `num_transactions`: The total number of transactions for that country within the last 30 days. This is achieved by `COUNT(transactions_details)`, which counts the records in the `transactions_details` collection that fall into the current country partition.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all transaction amounts for that country within the last 30 days. This is achieved by `SUM(transactions_details.t_amount)`, summing the `t_amount` field from the `transactions_details` records in the current country partition.
5.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 5 countries with the highest `total_transaction_amount`. The results will include the `country_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount` for these top 5 countries.

1.  **`vti_prices_in_range = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This line defines a contextless expression named `vti_prices_in_range`.
    *   It starts with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these records based on two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This ensures that only records for the ticker symbol 'VTI' are considered. It accesses the `symbol` attribute from the related `ticker` entity.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters records for the ""past 7 days"".
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 6` means we include records where the difference is 0 (today), 1 (yesterday), ..., up to 6 (6 days ago). This covers a total span of 7 calendar days.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, we use `CALCULATE` to compute a new field `num_sell_transactions`.
    *   `num_sell_transactions` is determined by counting records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection (which lists all transactions for that customer).
    *   The `transactions_made` are filtered using `WHERE` to include only those that:
        *   Have `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
        *   Occurred on the date ""2023-04-01"". This is checked by comparing the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` of the `date_time` field.
    *   We also select the customer's `_id` (as `customer_identifier`) and `name` (as `customer_name_val`) to carry them forward for the final output.

2.  **`top_customer_by_transactions = customer_transaction_counts.TOP_K(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `customer_transaction_counts` collection (which now includes each customer and their count of relevant transactions).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_sell_transactions.DESC())` selects the single customer (`k=1`) who has the highest `num_sell_transactions`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

3.  **`result = top_customer_by_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   From the single customer record returned by `TOP_K`, we use `CALCULATE` again to format the final output.
    *   It selects the customer's original `_id` (from `customer_identifier`), `name` (from `customer_name_val`), and renames `num_sell_transactions` to `number_of_transactions` to match the requested output field name.",37.60857582092285,"# Calculate the number of ""sell"" transactions on 2023-04-01 for each customer.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in the first quarter of 2023 (January, February, March) and had a status of ""successful"".
2.  For these filtered transactions, create a formatted string representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") to be used for grouping.
3.  Partition the filtered transactions by this year-month string.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction price.
5.  The result will show each month in Q1 2023 (that has successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price.

```python
# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and successful status, and prepare a year-month key
q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(
    (status == ""successful"") &

).CALCULATE(
    month = year_month_str,
    avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions that occurred in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitutes the first quarter.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year_month_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(date_time), LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")))`: For each filtered transaction, this creates a new field `year_month_str`.
        *   `YEAR(date_time)` extracts the year.
        *   `MONTH(date_time)` extracts the month number.
        *   `LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, ""0"")` pads the month number with a leading zero if it's a single digit (e.g., 1 becomes ""01"").
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", ...)` combines the year and padded month with a hyphen, creating a string like ""2023-01"".

2.  `monthly_average_prices = q1_2023_successful_transactions.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered and prepared transactions and partitions them.
    *   `name=""monthly_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` field names here, it's part of the syntax).
    *   `by=(year_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of `year_month_str`. This means all transactions for ""2023-01"" will be in one group, ""2023-02"" in another, and so on.

3.  `.CALCULATE(month = year_month_str, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `month = year_month_str`: Selects the `year_month_str` (which represents the month) for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` refers to the `price` attribute of the items in the `monthly_group` partition, which originate from the `Transactions` collection.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result by the month in ascending order (e.g., ""2023-01"", ""2023-02"", ""2023-03"").

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the time window for the ""last 8 calendar weeks, excluding the current week"". This involves calculating the start of the current week, then finding the start date of the 8-week period (8 weeks prior to the current week's start) and the end date of this period (which is the start of the current week, making the period exclusive of the current week). These boundaries are calculated once using the `Dealership` (top-level graph) context.
2.  **Filter Sales and Access Payments**: We select sales with a `sale_price` greater than $30,000 and then access their associated payments (`Sales.payment`).
3.  **Process Payments**: For each payment, we calculate:
    *   `payment_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the payment occurred.
    *   `is_weekend_day`: A boolean indicating if the payment was made on a Saturday or Sunday.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: We filter these processed payments to include only those whose `payment_week_start` falls within our defined 8-week period.
5.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**: The filtered payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start`. For each week, we calculate:
    *   `week`: The start date of the week.
    *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments in that week.
    *   `weekend_payments_received`: The count of payments made on a weekend in that week.

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to select only cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. The matching for `vin_number` will be case-insensitive by converting the `vin_number` to lowercase and searching for 'm5'. This addresses the ""LIKE with wildcards"" requirement for VIN.
2.  Group the filtered cars by their `make` and `model` using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars), calculate the total number of sales. This is done by counting the records in the `sale_records` sub-collection for all cars within that group.
4.  The final output will include the car's make, model, and the calculated total number of sales.

The instruction regarding case-insensitive and partial matching for `make` and `model` is interpreted to apply if these fields were used in a filter. Since they are used here as grouping keys, their original values will define the groups.

```python
# Filter cars where the VIN number contains 'M5' (case-insensitive)

result = sales_per_model_with_m5_vin
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_in_vin = Cars.WHERE(CONTAINS(LOWER(vin_number), 'm5') == 1)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `CONTAINS(LOWER(vin_number), 'm5') == 1` checks if the lowercase version of the `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for the VIN. Only cars satisfying this condition are kept.

2.  `sales_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_in_vin.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))`:
    *   This takes the filtered `cars_with_m5_in_vin`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group is named `car_model_group`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` of the cars in the group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` of the cars in the group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for the current (make, model) group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` sub-collection of the cars within the current partition. `COUNT` aggregates these sales records across all cars in that specific (make, model) group that also met the VIN criteria.

This query involves filtering sales based on the car make and the sale date, and then aggregating the results.

Here's the PyDough code:

    (car.make == ""Toyota"") &
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & # Ensures sale_date is not in the future

    number_of_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales_filtered),
    total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales_filtered.sale_price)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales_filtered = Sales.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales based on two conditions combined with an `&` (AND) operator:
        *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This condition filters sales to include only those where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"". We access the car's make via the relationship `Sales.car.make`.
        *   The date condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29)` filters sales to those that occurred in the last 30 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date/time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
            *   `>= 0` ensures the `sale_date` is not in the future.
            *   `<= 29` ensures the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days (i.e., 0 days ago (today) up to 29 days ago).

2.  **`toyota_sales_summary = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use the top-level `Dealership` collection's `CALCULATE` method because the query asks for a single aggregated result (total number of sales and total revenue).
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales_filtered)`: This calculates the total number of sales that met the criteria defined in `recent_toyota_sales_filtered` by counting the records in that filtered collection.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales_filtered.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in the `recent_toyota_sales_filtered` collection, giving the total revenue from these sales. If there are no such sales, `SUM` will typically result in 0 or null depending on the system's behavior for summing an empty set.

The final result is assigned to the variable `toyota_sales_summary`, which will contain the two requested metrics.",34.1868782043457,"# Filter sales for Toyota cars made in the last 30 days (inclusive of today)

4.  **`total_sales_amount = SUM(sales_made.sale_price),`**: This calculates the total sales amount for each salesperson.
    *   `sales_made` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each salesperson.
    *   `sale_price` is a field within each `Sale` record.
    *   `SUM(...)` aggregates these sale prices to get the total sum for that salesperson. It's assumed that if a salesperson has no sales, this sum will be 0.

5.  **`number_of_sales = COUNT(sales_made),`**: This counts the number of sales made by each salesperson.

6.  **`SR = RANKING(by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC())`**: This calculates the sales rank (SR) for each salesperson.
    *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank.
    *   `by=SUM(sales_made.sale_price).DESC()` specifies that the ranking should be based on the total sales amount (re-calculated here as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` to ensure it's available for the `RANKING` function context), in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank. The default behavior for ties (assigning the same rank) is assumed.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as we are interested in cars that have been sold and their sale prices.
2.  For each sale, retrieve the associated car's `make` and `model`.
3.  For each car associated with a sale, determine its latest inventory status. This is done by:
    *   Accessing the car's `inventory_snapshots`.
    *   Using the `RANKING` window function to find the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` for that specific car (`per=""car""`).
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to select this single latest snapshot.
    *   Checking the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot.
4.  Filter the sales records to include only those where the car's latest inventory status indicates it is no longer in inventory (i.e., `is_in_inventory == False`).
5.  Partition these filtered sales records by the car's `make` and `model`.
6.  For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` using `MAX(Sales.sale_price)`. This aggregates the original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records that fall into each partition group.

**Explanation:**

*   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Cars` collection based on the specified conditions.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains 'ford'. The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches, and `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
*   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains 'mustang'.
*   `|`: This is the OR operator, combining the two conditions so that cars matching either condition are included.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this function is used to select the desired fields and compute the average sale price.

The metrics are for the last 6 full months, excluding the current month. The results should be ordered by month, and months are to be represented in ""YYYY-MM"" format.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Range**:
    *   `window_start_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 6 months prior to the current month. For example, if the current month is August 2023, this will be February 1, 2023.
    *   `window_end_date_val`: Calculates the first day of the current month. Sales on or after this date are excluded. This ensures we only consider sales from the 6 full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter Salespersons**:
    *   `selected_salespersons`: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 or 2023.

3.  **Process Sales Data**:
    *   `sales_in_scope`:
        *   Accesses `sales_made` from the `selected_salespersons`.
        *   For each sale, it calculates `sale_month_start_datetime` by truncating the `sale_date` to the start of its month. This is used for grouping and filtering by month.
        *   The `sale_price` is carried forward as `price_of_sale`.
        *   Filters these sales to include only those where `sale_month_start_datetime` falls within the defined 6-month window (`>= window_start_date_val` and `< window_end_date_val`).

4.  **Aggregate Monthly Metrics**:
    *   `monthly_sales_summary`:
        *   Takes `sales_in_scope` and partitions it by `sale_month_start_datetime`. This groups all sales by the calendar month they occurred in.
        *   For each month group:
            *   `month_date_value`: Stores the actual datetime value for the start of the month (from the partition key).
            *   `pmsps_val`: Calculates PMSPS by counting the number of sales (`COUNT(sales_in_scope)`) within that month's group.
            *   `pmsr_val`: Calculates PMSR by summing the `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month's group. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a month had sales but they all summed to null (or if `SUM` on an empty set is null), it would show 0.0.
        *   Orders the results chronologically by `month_date_value`.

5.  **Format Output**:
    *   `final_monthly_metrics`:
        *   Takes the `monthly_sales_summary`.
        *   Formats the `month_date_value` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (e.g., ""2023-02"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for two-digit month padding.
        *   Selects the final fields: `month` (the formatted string), `PMSPS` (from `pmsps_val`), and `PMSR` (from `pmsr_val`).

**Note on ""all months""**: This solution will list months for which there was at least one sale from the selected salespersons within the specified period. If one of the 6 months in the window had zero sales from this group, that month would not appear in the output, as PyDough's `PARTITION` typically creates groups based on existing data. The requirement ""Return all months in your answer, including those where metrics are 0"" is met for months that have data to form a partition; `DEFAULT_TO` handles the zero metrics in such cases. Generating rows for months with absolutely no underlying data would require a different approach, like using a calendar dimension, which is not explicitly available or standard in these PyDough examples.

- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- We access the `Sales` collection.
- The `WHERE` clause filters these sales:

2.  Calculate the average of these day differences across all payments.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because the final result is a single aggregated value (the overall average).
2.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_diff=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.

    *   The result of this difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_diff`.
3.  `.days_diff`: This accesses the list of `days_diff` values calculated in the previous step.

1.  Filter all sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Revenue for each sale is `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. The cost for each sale is `car.cost`.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The query will first calculate the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` from the `Sales` collection, filtering by the `sale_date`. Then, it will use these aggregated values to compute the `gpm_2023`.

    )
)
```
Explanation:
1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection to perform a global calculation.
2.  `total_revenue_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: Accesses the sale price for each of these sales.
    *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these sale prices, giving the total revenue for 2023.
3.  `total_cost_2023=SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale, it accesses the related car (`.car`) and then its cost (`.cost`).
    *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these costs, giving the total cost of goods sold for 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=IFF(...))`: This second `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`.
5.  `gpm_2023=IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0)`:
    *   This calculates the GPM using the formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
    *   `IFF(total_cost_2023 == 0, 0, ...)`: This is a conditional check to prevent division by zero. If `total_cost_2023` is zero, GPM is set to 0 (or you might choose `None` or another indicator depending on business rules for such cases). Otherwise, the GPM is calculated.
    *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point division.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to find those where the car associated with the sale (`Sales.car`) has an inventory record in `InventorySnapshots` showing it went out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the same date as the sale (`InventorySnapshots.snapshot_date == Sales.sale_date`). We use the `HAS` function to check for the existence of such an inventory snapshot.
3.  From this filtered list of sales, identify the one with the highest `sale_price` using the `TOP_K` function.
4.  For this top sale, extract the car's `make`, `model` (from `Sales.car.make` and `Sales.car.model`), and the `sale_price`.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the day it went out of inventory

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`:
    *   We start by querying the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1` checks if for each sale, its associated car (`car`) has at least one record in its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that meets the specified criteria.
    *   The inner `WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))` filters the `inventory_snapshots`.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False` ensures the snapshot records when the car went out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date` ensures this happened on the same day as the `sale_date` of the current `Sales` record.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the filtered sales (those that occurred on the day the car went out of inventory).
    *   It selects the top 1 sale, ordered by `sale_price` in descending order (`DESC()`), effectively finding the sale with the highest price.

3.  `.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`:
    *   For the single sale record resulting from `TOP_K`, this `CALCULATE` clause selects the desired fields:

The result should include all months present in the data, ordered chronologically.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Extract Year and Month**:
    First, we process the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, we extract the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions. These are stored as `pay_year` and `pay_month`.

2.  **Group by Month and Calculate Monthly Totals**:
    The `payments_info` collection (containing `pay_year`, `pay_month` for each payment) is then partitioned by `pay_year` and `pay_month`. This creates groups for each unique year-month combination present in the data.
    For each group, we calculate:
    *   `year_of_payment`: The year of the payment group.
    *   `month_of_payment`: The month of the payment group.
    *   `total_payments_this_month`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values from `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into the current year-month group. This gives the total payments for that specific month.

3.  **Calculate Month-over-Month (MoM) Change**:
    On the `monthly_payment_summary` (which contains total payments for each month), we perform further calculations:
    *   `previous_month_total_payments`: We use the `PREV()` window function to get the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding month. The `by=(year_of_payment.ASC(), month_of_payment.ASC())` clause ensures that ""previous"" is determined chronologically. A `default=0.0` is provided for the `PREV` function; this means for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the `previous_month_total_payments` will be 0.0.
    *   `month_over_month_change`: This is calculated as `total_payments_this_month - previous_month_total_payments`, adhering to the specified definition.

4.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the results are ordered by `year_of_payment` and then `month_of_payment` in ascending order to present a chronological view of monthly payments and their MoM changes.

The query will include entries for all year-month combinations for which there is at least one payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` table. If a month has no payment records, it will not appear in the output.

"What is the TSC in the past 7 days, inclusive of today?TSC = Total Sales Count.","SELECT COUNT(_id) AS TSC FROM sales WHERE sale_date >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Dealership,"Okay, I can help you with that. To calculate the Total Sales Count (TSC) for the past 7 days, inclusive of today, we'll need to:
1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 7 days (i.e., the difference between today and the `sale_date` is less than or equal to 6 days).
3.  Count the number of sales that match this criterion.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
tsc_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    TSC=COUNT(Sales.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6))
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total sales count).
2.  `TSC=COUNT(...)`: We are defining a new field called `TSC`. Its value will be the count of sales records.
3.  `Sales.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Sales` sub-collection and apply a filter to it.
4.  `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This is the core of the filtering logic:
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: This function gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))`: This calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date.
    *   `<= 6`: We filter for sales where this difference is less than or equal to 6. This means:
        *   If the sale was today, the difference is 0 days.
        *   If the sale was yesterday, the difference is 1 day.
        *   ...
        *   If the sale was 6 days ago, the difference is 6 days.
        This effectively gives us a 7-day window, including today.
5.  `COUNT(...)`: After filtering, this function counts the number of sales records that satisfy the condition.",8.166524887084961,"tsc_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  Filter out salespersons who have not made any sales, as ASP would be undefined or zero for them, and they wouldn't typically be considered in a ""top by ASP"" ranking. We use `WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)` for this.
3.  For each remaining salesperson, calculate their total sales amount by summing the `sale_price` of all sales they made (`SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`).
4.  Also, count the number of sales for each salesperson (`COUNT(sales_made)`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those salespersons who have at least one sale record. This is important to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  The first `.CALCULATE(...)` then computes:
    *   `calc_first_name=first_name`: Retrieves the salesperson's first name.
    *   `calc_last_name=last_name`: Retrieves the salesperson's last name.

    *   `num_of_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by each salesperson.
3.  The second `.CALCULATE(...)` takes the output of the first and computes:

Explanation:
1.  `sales_with_car_details`: We start by creating a temporary collection from `Sales`. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (via the `car` relationship) and the `sale_price`. These are named `car_make_field`, `car_model_field`, and `sale_price_val` respectively to ensure they are available as scalar fields for partitioning and aggregation.
2.  `model_grouped_sales_summary`: This step partitions the `sales_with_car_details` collection by `car_make_field` and `car_model_field`. For each unique combination of make and model (each `model_group`):
    *   `make=car_make_field` and `model=car_model_field`: These select the make and model for the output.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_with_car_details.sale_price_val)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price_val` for all sales belonging to the current make-model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
    *   `total_number_of_sales=COUNT(sales_with_car_details)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make-model group, representing the total number of units sold for that model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue`: We then use `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` on the `model_grouped_sales_summary` to select the 5 car models that have the highest `total_revenue`. The `DESC()` ensures that the highest revenue models are ranked first.
The final `result` will be a collection of up to 5 rows, each containing the `make`, `model`, `total_revenue`, and `total_number_of_sales` for the top-selling car models.",43.76485586166382,"# Step 1: Create a collection of sales with car make, model, and sale price.

**Explanation:**

1.  `salespersons_employment_info = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to create a new set of fields for each salesperson:
        *   `s_first_name`: Stores the salesperson's `first_name`.
        *   `s_last_name`: Stores the salesperson's `last_name`.
        *   `s_phone`: Stores the salesperson's `phone` number.
        *   `employment_duration_days`: Calculates the difference in days between `hire_date` and `termination_date` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`. If `termination_date` is null (meaning the salesperson is still employed), this duration is expected to be null.

2.  `shortest_employed_salesperson = salespersons_employment_info.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `salespersons_employment_info` collection.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`: This function selects the top 1 salesperson. The selection is ordered by `employment_duration_days` in ascending order (`ASC()`). Crucially, if `employment_duration_days` is null (e.g., for salespersons not yet terminated), `ASC()` places these nulls at the end of the sort order by default.

2.  Filter these payments to include only those where the `vendor_name` is 'Utility Company'.
3.  Further filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). We can achieve this using the `DAYNAME` function to get the name of the day and then check if it is ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using the `ISIN` function.
4.  Finally, count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions using the `COUNT` aggregation function.

1.  **Determine Date Boundaries**: We first calculate the start and end dates of the ""previous ISO week"". We assume that `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` truncates the current timestamp to the beginning of the current ISO week (i.e., Monday at 00:00:00).
    *   `_current_week_start_date`: The start of the current ISO week.
    *   `_previous_week_start_date`: The start of the previous ISO week, which is 7 days before `_current_week_start_date`.
    *   The previous ISO week will span from `_previous_week_start_date` (inclusive) up to `_current_week_start_date` (exclusive).

2.  **Filter Payments**: We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated previous ISO week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: From the filtered payments, we extract the day part of the `payment_date` (to aggregate daily) and carry forward the `payment_method` and `payment_amount`.

4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: We then partition these prepared records by the extracted `payment_day` and `payment_method`. For each group, we sum the `payment_amount` to get the total daily amount for that specific payment method.

5.  **Format Output**: The final result will show the transaction date (day), the payment method type, and the total received amount for that combination.

This query relies on the `DATETIME(base, 'start of week')` function correctly identifying the start of an ISO week (Monday).

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `date_context`: This calculates two key dates using the main `Dealership` collection as a starting point:
    *   `_current_week_start_date`: Determined by taking the current timestamp (`'now'`) and truncating it to the 'start of week'. We assume this means Monday 00:00:00 of the current week as per ISO 8601.
    *   `_previous_week_start_date`: Calculated by subtracting 7 days from `_current_week_start_date`, giving Monday 00:00:00 of the previous week.

2.  `payments_in_scope`:
    *   This starts by accessing the `PaymentsReceived` sub-collection from the `date_context` (which makes `_previous_week_start_date` and `_current_week_start_date` available).
    *   It filters these payments using `WHERE` to include only those where `payment_date` is on or after `_previous_week_start_date` and before `_current_week_start_date`. This range covers the entire previous ISO week (Monday to Sunday).
    *   `CALCULATE` then prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_for_grouping`: Extracts the date part (day with time truncated to 00:00:00) from `payment_date` using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This allows for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method`: The original `payment_method` is carried over for grouping.
        *   `payment_amount`: The original `payment_amount` is carried over for summation.

3.  `result`:
    *   This takes `payments_in_scope` and partitions it using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""daily_payment_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partitioned groups (not strictly used later in this query but good practice).
    *   `by=(payment_day_for_grouping, payment_method)`: Groups the records by the unique combinations of the extracted day and payment method.
    *   The final `CALCULATE` transforms each group into a single output row:
        *   `transaction_date`: The day of the transactions, taken from `payment_day_for_grouping`.
        *   `payment_method_type`: The payment method for this group, taken from `payment_method`.
        *   `total_received_amount`: The sum of `payment_amount` for all records within that specific day and payment method group, calculated using `SUM(payments_in_scope.payment_amount)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_transformed`:
    *   We start by filtering the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` clause, we derive:
        *   `customer_st`: The state of the customer associated with the sale, accessed via `customer.state`.
        *   `_month_of_sale`: An intermediate field for the month of the sale.
        *   `_first_month_in_quarter_num`: An intermediate field that determines the first month number (1, 4, 7, or 10) of the quarter based on `_month_of_sale`.
        *   `quarter_start_dt_str`: The final string representation of the quarter's start date (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). This is constructed using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for correct formatting.

2.  `quarterly_sales_report`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_transformed` data. The partitioning keys are `customer_st` and `quarter_start_dt_str`. This groups sales by unique combinations of customer state and quarter start date.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause on the partitioned data then:
        *   Selects the partitioning keys `customer_st` (as `state_val`) and `quarter_start_dt_str` (as `quarter_val`).
        *   Calculates `total_sales_for_quarter` by summing `Sales.sale_price` for all sales records belonging to each group.

3.  `result`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `latest_snapshot_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by operating on the top-level `Dealership` collection to determine a global value: the latest snapshot date in March 2023.
    *   `MAX(InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).snapshot_date)`: This part filters all `InventorySnapshots` to include only those where the `snapshot_date` falls in March (`MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3`) of the year 2023 (`YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023`). From these filtered snapshots, it selects the maximum `snapshot_date`.
    *   This maximum date is then assigned to a new field `latest_date_in_march_2023`. `latest_snapshot_info` becomes a collection with a single row containing this calculated date.

2.  `result = latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...).car.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `latest_snapshot_info.InventorySnapshots`: We access the `InventorySnapshots` collection within the context of `latest_snapshot_info`. This makes the `latest_date_in_march_2023` field available for filtering.
    *   `.WHERE((snapshot_date == latest_date_in_march_2023) & (is_in_inventory == True))`: This filters the `InventorySnapshots` to keep only those records where:

        *   `is_in_inventory` is `True` (meaning the car was in inventory for that snapshot).
    *   `.car`: For each snapshot that meets the criteria, we navigate to the related `car` record.
    *   `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`: Finally, for each selected car, we retrieve its `_id`, `make`, `model`, and `year`, as requested.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: The query starts with the `Drugs` collection. For each drug, we will calculate its name and its average Defined Daily Dose (DDD).

2.  **`drug_name = drug_name`**: This selects the `drug_name` field from the `Drugs` collection to be included in the output.

3.  **`average_ddd_value = AVG(...)`**: This calculates the average DDD for each drug. The `AVG` function aggregates DDD values calculated from the drug's associated treatments.

4.  **`treatments_used_in`**: This accesses the list of treatments in which the current drug was used.

5.  **`.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`**: This filters the treatments to include only those relevant for DDD calculation:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as per the DDD definition.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Ensures that the total days of treatment is a positive value. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the duration of the treatment in full days. This condition prevents division by zero (if duration is 0) or illogical negative DDDs (if duration is negative).

6.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_ddd = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`**: For each filtered treatment, this calculates its individual DDD:
    *   `tot_drug_amt`: Represents the ""total drug amount consumed during one treatment"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: Represents the ""total days of treatment"".
    *   The result is named `treatment_ddd`.

7.  **`.treatment_ddd`**: After calculating `treatment_ddd` for all valid treatments of a drug, this expression provides these individual DDD values to the `AVG` function.

The final result will be a collection where each record contains the `drug_name` and its corresponding `average_ddd_value`. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria (e.g., all treatments have null end dates or non-positive durations), its `average_ddd_value` will likely be null.",38.543235778808594,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date References Calculation (`date_references`):**
    *   The query first calculates the year and month for three specific time periods: the last full month (M-1), the month before last (M-2), and two months before last (M-3). This is done relative to the current date using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` as a base and subtracting 1, 2, or 3 months.
    *   These date components (`m1_year_val`, `m1_month_val`, etc.) are calculated at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level, making them available as context for subsequent operations on the `Treatments` collection.

2.  **Filtering and Augmenting Treatments (`treatments_in_target_months`):**
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection via `date_references.Treatments`.
    *   For each treatment, it extracts the `treatment_yr` (year of `start_dt`) and `treatment_mth` (month of `start_dt`).
    *   It stores the `patient_id` as `patient_identifier` for later distinct counting.
    *   It adds a boolean flag `is_biologic_drug_treatment` which is true if the treatment's associated drug has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these augmented treatments, keeping only those whose `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth` match one of the three target months calculated in `date_references`.

3.  **Partitioning and Aggregation (`monthly_patient_summary`):**
    *   The `treatments_in_target_months` collection is then partitioned by `treatment_yr` and `treatment_mth`. This groups all treatments by the month they occurred in.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each of the target months that has treatment data):
        *   `month_label`: A display string for the month is created in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-10"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `distinct_patient_count`: `NDISTINCT` is used on `treatments_in_target_months.patient_identifier` to count the unique number of patients who received any treatment in that specific month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count`: `NDISTINCT` is used on `treatments_in_target_months.WHERE(is_biologic_drug_treatment == True).patient_identifier`. This first filters the treatments within the month to include only biologic drug treatments, and then counts the unique number of patients who received such treatments.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_label` in descending order, so the most recent of the three months appears first.

4.  **Final Result (`result`):**
    *   The `monthly_patient_summary` variable holds the final result, which will contain rows for each of the last three months (that had treatment data), with columns: `month_label`, `distinct_patient_count`, and `biologic_treatment_patient_count`.",73.94225883483887,"# Step 1: Calculate the year and month for the three target months (last month, month before last, two months before last)

1.  Define the relevant time period:

    *   The start of the period (inclusive) is 6 months prior to the start of the current month.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `end_dt_exclusive = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This line defines a variable `end_dt_exclusive`. It uses the `DATETIME` function to get the current timestamp (`'now'`) and then truncates it to the 'start of month'. This effectively gives us the first moment of the current month, which will serve as the exclusive upper bound for our date filter.
2.  `start_dt_inclusive = DATETIME(end_dt_exclusive, '-6 months')`: This line defines `start_dt_inclusive`. It takes the `end_dt_exclusive` (start of the current month) and subtracts 6 months from it. This gives us the first moment of the month that was 6 months ago, serving as the inclusive lower bound for our date filter.
3.  `alice_treatment_count = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`), which is suitable for producing a single aggregated result.
4.  `num_treatments_last_6_months = COUNT(...)`: Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `num_treatments_last_6_months`. Its value will be the count of treatments that meet the specified criteria.
5.  `Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"")`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only those patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"".
6.  `.treatments_received`: From the filtered patients, we access their associated treatments through the `treatments_received` sub-collection.
7.  `.WHERE((start_dt >= start_dt_inclusive) & (start_dt < end_dt_exclusive))`: This filters the treatments further. A treatment is included if its `start_dt` (start date) is on or after `start_dt_inclusive` AND before `end_dt_exclusive`. This ensures we only count treatments within the last 6 full months, excluding the current month.

1.  **Calculate Distinct Drugs per Doctor**: For each doctor, we first determine the number of unique drugs they have prescribed. This is done by accessing their `prescribed_treatments`, then the associated `drug` for each treatment, and finally counting the number of distinct `drug_id`s.
2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We then group the doctors by their `speciality`. This creates logical groups within which ranking will occur.
3.  **Rank Doctors within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, we calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The ranking is based on the `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` in descending order (more drugs mean a better rank, e.g., rank 1). The `per=""specialty_group""` argument in the `RANKING` function ensures the rank is computed relative to other doctors in the same specialty.

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_with_drug_counts`: This initial step processes the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it retains their `doc_id` and `speciality`, and calculates `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` by counting the unique `drug_id`s from their `prescribed_treatments`.
2.  `doctors_partitioned_by_specialty`: This step takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection and partitions it by `speciality`. The result is a new collection where each item represents a unique specialty, and contains a sub-collection of doctors belonging to that specialty. This partition is named `specialty_group`.
3.  `ranked_doctors_in_specialty`: We then access the sub-collection of doctors within each `specialty_group` (this sub-collection is implicitly named `doctors_with_drug_counts`, matching the input collection to `PARTITION`). On this sub-collection, we perform a `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It selects `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed`.
    *   It computes `SDRSDR` using the `RANKING` function. `by=num_distinct_drugs_prescribed.DESC()` ensures that doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a better (lower numerical) rank. `per=""specialty_group""` ensures this ranking is performed independently within each specialty.
4.  `result`: The final variable `result` holds the collection of all doctors, each with their `doc_id`, `speciality`, the total number of distinct drugs they prescribed, and their rank (`SDRSDR`) within their specialty.",57.52324104309082,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor

The `start_dt` of treatments is used to determine the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   A new field, `calc_treatment_year_month`, is calculated by combining the year and month from `start_dt` into a 'YYYY-MM' string format (e.g., ""2023-03""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits. This field will be used for grouping.
    *   The `start_dt` is aliased to `calc_treatment_start_dt` to be used in the filtering condition.

2.  **Filter for the Relevant Time Period**:
    *   The treatments are filtered to include only those within the last 12 full months, prior to the current month.
    *   The start of this period is `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-12 months')` (e.g., if today is 2024-07-15, this is 2023-07-01).
    *   The end of this period is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` (e.g., 2024-07-01), making the range exclusive of the current month.
    *   The condition is `(calc_treatment_start_dt >= start_of_period) & (calc_treatment_start_dt < end_of_period)`.

3.  **Group by Month and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered treatments are then partitioned (grouped) by `calc_treatment_year_month` using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_data_group"", by=(calc_treatment_year_month))`.
    *   Within each monthly group, the following metrics are calculated:
        *   `output_month`: This is the `calc_treatment_year_month` for the group.
        *   `PMPD_metric`: Calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received a treatment (and thus an associated diagnosis) that started in that month.
        *   `PMTC_metric`: Calculated as `COUNT(Treatments)`. This counts the total number of treatments that started in that month.
    *   The results are ordered by `output_month` in ascending order.

4.  **Final Output**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `month`, `PMPD`, and `PMTC` as requested.

1.  **Filter Outcomes**: Select only those outcome records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll use the `DEFAULT_TO(field, sentinel_value) != sentinel_value` pattern to check for non-null values, assuming a `sentinel_value` (e.g., -999) that valid PASI scores will not take.
2.  **Calculate Average Scores**: Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` and average `day100_pasi_score` from these filtered records.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcome_scores`: This line defines a filtered subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It includes only records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. The non-null check is performed using `DEFAULT_TO(field, -999) != -999`, which effectively filters out nulls if -999 is a value that actual PASI scores would not take.
2.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the highest level of the database graph.
    *   `avg_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_outcome_scores.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcome_scores`.
3.  The subsequent `.CALCULATE(...)` takes these two average values:
    *   `calculated_d7d100pir = (avg_day100_pasi - avg_day7_pasi) / avg_day7_pasi * 100`: Applies the D7D100PIR formula as defined in the problem description.
4.  The final `.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR = calculated_d7d100pir)` selects this computed D7D100PIR value and names the resulting column `D7D100PIR`. This will produce a table with a single row and a single column containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.",78.8199372291565,"# Step 1: Filter outcome records to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we calculate a new field `num_relevant_adverse_events`. This field will store the total count of adverse events associated with that drug that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   To calculate this, we iterate through each `treatment` in the drug's `treatments_used_in` list.
    *   For each `treatment`, we count its `adverse_events` where the `reported_dt` of the adverse event falls in the same calendar month and year as the `start_dt` of that `treatment`. This is achieved by comparing `YEAR(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `YEAR(treatment.start_dt)` and `MONTH(adverse_event.reported_dt)` with `MONTH(treatment.start_dt)`.
    *   The counts from each treatment associated with the drug are then summed up to get `num_relevant_adverse_events` for the drug.
3.  After calculating this count for all drugs, we use `TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_adverse_events.DESC())` to find the single drug that has the highest count.
4.  Finally, we select and rename the fields to `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and `num_adverse_events` for the resulting drug.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have at least one prescribed treatment (`prescribed_treatments`) where the associated drug (`drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'. The `HAS` function is used to check for the existence of such treatments.
3.  Group the filtered doctors by their location state (`loc_state`) using the `PARTITION` method. This ensures that we process each state only once.
4.  Use the `CALCULATE` method to output the distinct state names.

```python
# Filter doctors to find those who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

# navigating to the 'drug' and checking its 'drug_type'.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first filters the `Doctors` collection. The `WHERE` clause uses the `HAS` function to check if a doctor has any `prescribed_treatments` that satisfy the condition `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`. This condition navigates from a treatment to its associated drug and checks the drug's type.

Once the relevant doctors are identified, the `PARTITION` method is used. It groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. The `name=""unique_doctor_states""` argument names these groups.

Finally, `CALCULATE(state_name=loc_state)` is applied to the result of the partition. Since `PARTITION` creates groups based on unique `loc_state` values, this `CALCULATE` effectively produces a list of distinct states, renaming `loc_state` to `state_name` in the output.",24.904441356658936,"# Filter doctors to find those who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

        *   Calculate the average (`AVG`) of these `day100_pasi_score` values. `AVG` will typically ignore NULL scores.

        *   Count the number of patients within the current insurance type group who have at least one treatment (`HAS(treatments_received...`) that ended in the year 2022 (`YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`).
4.  Filter these calculated statistics to include only insurance types where `avg_pasi_score_d100` is not NULL, ensuring that we are considering types with actual score data.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors`**: We start by accessing the `Doctors` collection, which contains information about all doctors.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `prescribed_treatments` is a sub-collection (a list) of treatments associated with each doctor.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` checks if this list is not empty (i.e., the doctor has prescribed at least one treatment).
    *   `== 1` completes the condition, ensuring we only keep doctors for whom `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` is true.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(doc_id=doc_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`**: This step selects the specified fields for the doctors who met the filter criteria.
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `first_name=first_name`: Selects the doctor's first name.
    *   `last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.

The query will return a list of doctors, each with their `doc_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`, who have prescribed at least one treatment.

    *   `HAS(treatments_received.outcome_records)`: This function checks if there is at least one outcome record across all treatments for a given patient. It returns `True` (or 1) if outcome assessments exist, and `False` (or 0) otherwise.
    *   `== 1`: This ensures we only keep patients for whom `HAS(...)` is true.

2.  Filter these diagnoses to include only those that have associated treatments with outcome records where `day100_itch_vas` is recorded (i.e., not null).
3.  For each of these filtered diagnoses, calculate:
    a.  `diag_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis.
    b.  `max_itch_score_val`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` found among all outcome records linked to treatments for this diagnosis.
    c.  `num_patients_val`: The number of distinct patients who have a recorded `day100_itch_vas` score for treatments associated with this diagnosis. This ensures the patient count is relevant to the itch score context.
4.  Use `TOP_K(3, ...)` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking will be primarily by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order, and secondarily by `num_patients_val` in descending order (to resolve ties in itch score).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Diagnoses` collection. The `HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider diagnoses for which there is at least one treatment leading to an outcome where the `day100_itch_vas` score is recorded (not null).
2.  `CALCULATE(...)`: For each diagnosis that passes the filter:
    *   `diag_name_val=diag_name`: Stores the diagnosis name.
    *   `max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the highest `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the current diagnosis. The `MAX` function aggregates scores from the `outcome_records` sub-collection, which are linked via `treatments_for`.
    *   `num_patients_val=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.outcome_records.WHERE(day100_itch_vas != None).treatment.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients. This path navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments (`treatments_for`), then to the outcomes of those treatments (`outcome_records`), filters these outcomes to those with a recorded `day100_itch_vas`, then links back from each such outcome to its parent treatment (`.treatment`), then to the patient associated with that treatment (`.patient`), and finally gets the `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique patient IDs. This ensures the patient count is specific to those contributing to the `day100_itch_vas` data for the diagnosis.
3.  `TOP_K(3, by=(max_itch_score_val.DESC(), num_patients_val.DESC()))`: This selects the top 3 diagnoses. They are ordered first by `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). If there's a tie in scores, `num_patients_val` (also descending) is used as a tie-breaker.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   The code first defines `date_filter_start` and `date_filter_end` to establish the time window for ""past 6 calendar months"". This is interpreted as the six full calendar months immediately preceding the current month. For instance, if the current date is in July, this period would span from January 1st to June 30th of the same year.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` calculates the start of the month that was six months ago.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the start of the current month, which serves as the exclusive end point for the date range.

2.  **Treatment Filtering and Information Extraction**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Using `CALCULATE`, it derives two new fields for each treatment:
        *   `treatment_actual_start_dt`: Copied from the treatment's `start_dt`.
        *   `doc_specialty_field`: The specialty of the prescribing doctor, obtained by accessing `doctor.speciality`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause then filters these treatments, keeping only those where `treatment_actual_start_dt` falls within the calculated `date_filter_start` (inclusive) and `date_filter_end` (exclusive).

3.  **Aggregation by Specialty**:
    *   The `filtered_treatments_with_info` collection is then processed using `PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(doc_specialty_field))`. This groups the treatments based on the `doc_specialty_field` (the doctor's specialty).
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each specialty), `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The specialty name (from `doc_specialty_field`).
        *   `num_treatments`: The total count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered date range. `COUNT(Treatments)` refers to counting the underlying `Treatments` records that belong to this specific partition group.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with that specialty in the filtered date range. `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)` sums the `tot_drug_amt` from the underlying `Treatments` records in the partition group.

4.  **Top 3 Selection**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_based_aggregation`. This selects the top 3 doctor specialties, ordered by the `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

5.  **Result**:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**: This groups the `Patients` collection by the `ins_type` field. Each group, named `insurance_groups`, will contain patients with the same insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this `CALCULATE` clause operates on each `insurance_groups`.
    *   `ins_type_val=ins_type`: Selects the insurance type for the current group.
    *   `avg_height_cm_val=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: Calculates the average height (in cm) for all patients within the current insurance type group. `Patients.height_cm` here refers to the `height_cm` of patients belonging to that specific `ins_type` group.
    *   `avg_weight_kg_val=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Calculates the average weight (in kg) for all patients within the current insurance type group.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm_val.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 insurance type groups based on the `avg_height_cm_val` calculated in the previous step, in descending order (highest average height first).

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final `CALCULATE` clause formats the output for the top 3 groups.
    *   `insurance_type=ins_type_val`: Renames `ins_type_val` to `insurance_type`.
    *   `average_height=avg_height_cm_val`: Renames `avg_height_cm_val` to `average_height`.
    *   `average_weight=avg_weight_kg_val`: Renames `avg_weight_kg_val` to `average_weight`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Start with Drugs**: The query begins with the `Drugs` collection, as we are interested in information about drugs.
2.  **Calculate Metrics per Drug**:
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields for each drug:
        *   `drug_name`: This is the original name of the drug.
        *   `number_of_treatments`: This is calculated by counting the number of associated treatments for each drug using `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`. The `treatments_used_in` field is a sub-collection linking drugs to their treatments.
        *   `average_drug_amount`: This is calculated by taking the average of the `tot_drug_amt` (total drug amount) from all associated treatments for each drug, using `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`.
3.  **Select Top 5 Drugs**:
    *   The `TOP_K(5, by=number_of_treatments.DESC())` method is then applied to this calculated data.
    *   It selects the top 5 drugs.
    *   The sorting criterion (`by`) is `number_of_treatments.DESC()`, meaning drugs with a higher number of treatments will rank higher.
4.  **Return Requested Fields**: The resulting collection `top_drugs_analysis` will contain 5 records, each with the `drug_name`, `number_of_treatments`, and `average_drug_amount` for the top 5 drugs as determined by the number of treatments.",30.47754406929016,"top_drugs_analysis = Drugs.CALCULATE(

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"To determine the number of treatments meeting the specified criteria, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three main conditions:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. This will be checked case-insensitively using `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with wildcards (`%psoriasis%`).
    *   **Drug Condition**: The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We'll infer this by checking if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field in the `Drugs` collection (accessed via `Treatments.drug`) exists and is not null using `HAS()`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The treatment must have an `end_dt` that falls within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). We also ensure `end_dt` exists using `HAS()`.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the top `DermTreatment` level.

```python
# Filter treatments based on diagnosis, FDA approval of the drug, and end date
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)

)

# Calculate the total number of such treatments
count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause. All conditions within the `WHERE` clause must be true for a treatment to be included.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition checks the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with each treatment. `LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name)` converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')` then checks if this lowercase name contains ""psoriasis"" anywhere within it (due to the `%` wildcards).
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition verifies that the `drug` used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function returns true if the field exists and is not null, which we interpret as the drug being FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded before attempting date comparisons.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months prior to the current moment. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` is on or before the current moment, meaning it has indeed ended.

2.  `count_of_qualifying_treatments = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a global calculation.
    *   `num_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`: This calculates the total number of treatments present in the `filtered_treatments` collection and assigns this count to a new field named `num_treatments`.

1.  **Determine the Target Registration Year**: We calculate the year corresponding to ""2 years ago"" by subtracting 2 from the current year, obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`.
2.  **Filter Doctors**: We select doctors from the `Doctors` collection whose `year_reg` matches this target year. We also ensure these doctors have at least one prescribed treatment using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`.
3.  **Identify the First Treatment**: For each selected doctor, we need to find their earliest prescribed treatment.
    *   We access the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection.
    *   We use the `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)` function to rank treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `per=""Doctors""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each doctor. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single treatment is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date (though the specific tie-breaking rule is implicit).
    *   We filter for the treatment where this rank is 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR()` is then used to convert the resulting single-item collection into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields.
4.  **Select and Rename Fields**: We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`, and from their first treatment, the `start_dt` (as `first_treatment_date`) and `treatment_id` (as `first_treatment_id_val`). We interpret ""treatment _id"" as the `treatment_id` field from the `Treatments` collection, as it's the primary identifier for treatments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`**:
    *   This selects only treatments that are placebos by filtering the `Treatments` collection where the `is_placebo` field is `True`.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_id_val=treatment_id, treatment_start_dt_val=start_dt, treatment_end_dt_val=end_dt)`**:
    *   For these placebo treatments, we calculate (and effectively select) the `treatment_id`, `start_dt`, and `end_dt`.
    *   `start_dt` is aliased to `treatment_start_dt_val` and `end_dt` to `treatment_end_dt_val`. This makes the treatment's own start and end dates clearly available for use in the context of its sub-collection (`concomitant_meds`). `treatment_id` is aliased to `treatment_id_val`.

3.  **`.concomitant_meds`**:
    *   This accesses the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection associated with each of the previously selected placebo treatments. The fields calculated in the parent `CALCULATE` (like `treatment_start_dt_val`) are accessible here.

4.  **`.WHERE((DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start_dt_val, start_dt) >= -14) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start_dt_val, start_dt) <= 14))`**:
    *   This filters the `concomitant_meds`. The condition checks if the `start_dt` of the concomitant medication is within a 14-day window (either 14 days before or 14 days after) of the `treatment_start_dt_val` (the start date of the parent placebo treatment).
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment_start_dt_val, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the treatment's start date and the concomitant med's start date.
        *   If the med started up to 14 days before the treatment, the diff is between -14 and 0.
        *   If the med started up to 14 days after the treatment, the diff is between 0 and 14.
    *   So, `diff >= -14 & diff <= 14` covers the entire 2-week window around the treatment start.

5.  **`.CALCULATE(treatment_id=treatment_id_val, treatment_start_date=treatment_start_dt_val, treatment_end_date=treatment_end_dt_val, concomitant_med_start_date=start_dt, concomitant_med_end_date=end_dt)`**:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` selects the fields for the output from the filtered concomitant medications and their parent treatments:

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To calculate the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter the patients to include only those whose `gender` is ""male"" and `ins_type` is ""private"".
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This is done by finding the difference in full years between their `date_of_birth` and the current date using `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`.
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this average age.

```python
# Filter patients who are male and have private insurance, then calculate their current age
patients_filtered_with_age = Patients.WHERE(

Explanation:

1.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""male"") & (ins_type == ""private""))`: This line filters the `Patients` collection to select only records where the `gender` field is equal to ""male"" AND the `ins_type` field is equal to ""private"".
2.  `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each patient passing the filter, this calculates a new field `current_age_in_years`. The age is determined by the `DATEDIFF` function, which computes the number of full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time (obtained via `DATETIME('now')`).
3.  `patients_filtered_with_age`: This intermediate variable holds the collection of filtered patients, each with their calculated `current_age_in_years`.
4.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(avg_patient_age = AVG(patients_filtered_with_age.current_age_in_years))`: This line calculates the final result. It accesses the `DermTreatment` graph (the top-level collection) to compute a single aggregated value.
    *   `AVG(patients_filtered_with_age.current_age_in_years)`: This computes the average of the `current_age_in_years` field from the `patients_filtered_with_age` collection.
    *   `avg_patient_age = ...`: The result of the average calculation is assigned to a new field named `avg_patient_age`.
5.  `average_age_of_patients`: This variable stores the final result, which will be a collection with a single row and a single column `avg_patient_age` containing the calculated average age.",16.100186824798584,"# Filter patients who are male and have private insurance, then calculate their current age

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we need to calculate two values based on their received transactions:

    *   The total number of distinct successful transactions.
3.  The CPUR is then the ratio of these two values.
4.  We will handle cases where there are no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
5.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

We'll use a two-step `CALCULATE` process:
*   The first `CALCULATE` will compute the raw counts for distinct coupons used and distinct successful transactions, aliasing the merchant's name.
*   The second `CALCULATE` will use these computed counts to determine the CPUR and select the merchant's name and the CPUR for the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to prepare the necessary components for the CPUR calculation.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: The merchant's `name` is selected and aliased as `merchant_name_val`.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons_val=NDISTINCT(...)`: This calculates the numerator for CPUR.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"" AND have an associated coupon (checked using `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
        *   `.coupon.cid`: From these filtered transactions, it accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the associated coupons.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `num_distinct_transactions_val=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the denominator for CPUR.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that are ""successful"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the total number of such successful transactions.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one to compute the final CPUR and select the desired output fields.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: The aliased merchant name is selected for the output.
    *   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_transactions_val > 0, ... , 0.0)`: This is a conditional expression.
            *   If `num_distinct_transactions_val` (the count of successful transactions) is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division: `num_distinct_coupons_val / num_distinct_transactions_val`.
            *   Otherwise (if there are no successful transactions), CPUR is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.

1.  **Define Target Weeks**: First, we calculate the start dates of the three weeks preceding the current week. These will be used to filter notifications. We use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to make these dates available for subsequent operations.
2.  **Filter Users**: We select users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Access Notifications**: For these selected users, we access their `notifications`.
4.  **Enhance Notification Data**: For each notification, we calculate two new pieces of information:
    *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start of the week in which the notification was created. This is done by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the start of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_on_weekend`: A boolean flag indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME(created_at)`.
5.  **Filter Notifications by Target Weeks**: We then filter these processed notifications to include only those whose `notification_actual_week_start` falls into one of the three target weeks defined in step 1.
6.  **Group by Week**: The filtered notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by their `notification_actual_week_start`. This creates a group for each relevant week.
7.  **Aggregate Counts**: For each weekly group, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for that group.
    *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications in that group (i.e., for that week).
    *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications within that group that were sent on a weekend. This is achieved by summing up a conditional value (1 if `is_on_weekend` is true, 0 otherwise).

This approach ensures that we count notifications only for the specified users, correctly identify the relevant weeks, and aggregate the total and weekend notification counts for each of those weeks.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `recent_user_balances_filtered`: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection. It keeps only those records where the `updated_at` field is within the time window from exactly 7 days ago up to the current moment (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  `user_amb_collection`:
    *   This line takes the `recent_user_balances_filtered` data.
    *   It then uses `PARTITION(name=""user_balances_group"", by=(user_id))` to group these records by `user_id`.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each unique `user_id`), `CALCULATE(amb_for_user = AVG(UserBalances.balance))` computes the average of the `balance` values. `UserBalances.balance` here refers to the balances of the records within the current partition (i.e., for a specific user and within the filtered time window). The result, `amb_for_user`, is the AMB for that specific user over the 7-day period.
3.  `result`:
    *   This line performs a global calculation using the `Ewallet` (top-level) collection.
    *   `AVG(user_amb_collection.amb_for_user)` calculates the average of all the `amb_for_user` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The final output is stored in a field named `average_balance`.",67.91500568389893,"# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for entries updated within the last 7 days.

1.  Access each user from the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, look into their `balances` (which is a list of `UserBalances` records).
3.  Within these balances, identify the most recent one. The `UserBalances` collection has an `updated_at` field that we can use for this. We can use the `RANKING` window function to rank balances by `updated_at` in descending order for each user. The balance with rank 1 will be the latest.
4.  Extract the `balance` amount from this latest record.
5.  The final result should include user identifiers (like `uid` and `username`) and their LUB.

If a user has no balance records, their LUB will be null.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each user.
2.  `user_uid=uid, user_username=username`: We select the `uid` and `username` as identifiers for each user, renaming them to `user_uid` and `user_username` respectively.
3.  `latest_user_balance=...`: This defines the LUB.
    *   `balances`: This refers to the sub-collection of `UserBalances` associated with the current user.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This function ranks the balance records within the `balances` sub-collection for each user (`per=""Users""`). The ranking is based on the `updated_at` field in descending order (`updated_at.DESC()`), so the most recent balance gets rank 1.
        *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the balance record that has rank 1 (i.e., the latest one).

This rank is based on the revenue generated from successfully received transactions, specifically where the `receiver_type` is 1 (indicating a merchant). We need to return the merchant's name, category, their calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank (MRR).

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Start with Merchants**: We iterate through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  **Calculate Revenue**: For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue.
    *   This involves looking at their `transactions_received`.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those that were `successful` and where the `receiver_type` is `1`. The problem statement specifies `receiver_type=1` for transactions to merchants. Although transactions in `Merchants.transactions_received` inherently have the merchant as the receiver (and thus should have `receiver_type` indicating 'MERCHANT'), we include this filter explicitly as per the problem's instruction.
    *   We then sum the `amount` of these filtered transactions. We assume that if a merchant has no such transactions, this sum will be 0.
3.  **Assign Rank (MRR)**: After calculating the revenue for all merchants, we rank them.
    *   The rank (named `MRR`) is based on `revenue_amount` in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).
    *   We'll use `allow_ties=True` in the `RANKING` function so that merchants with the same revenue receive the same rank (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).
4.  **Select Output Fields**: We select the `merchant_name` (from `name`), `merchant_category` (from `category`), the calculated `revenue_amount`, and the `MRR`.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, we order the results by `MRR` in ascending order for clear presentation.

We make the following assumptions:
*   The status of a successful transaction is represented by the string `""successful""` in the `status` field of the `Transactions` collection.
*   `receiver_type == 1` is the correct condition to identify transactions where the receiver is a merchant.
*   The `SUM` aggregation function will return `0` if there are no transactions meeting the criteria for a merchant.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate revenue for each merchant.

merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `revenue_amount=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`: This calculates the total revenue for the merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the current merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is ""successful"" and `receiver_type` is 1.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Aggregates these amounts to get the total revenue for the merchant.

2.  `merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call takes the result from the first step (which includes merchant name, category, and their revenue amount) and adds the rank.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`, `merchant_category=merchant_category`, `revenue_amount=revenue_amount`: These pass through the already calculated/selected fields.
    *   `MRR=RANKING(by=revenue_amount.DESC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates the rank for each merchant.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: The ranking function.
        *   `by=revenue_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that ranking should be based on `revenue_amount` in descending order (higher revenue means better rank).
        *   `allow_ties=True`: Ensures that if multiple merchants have the same `revenue_amount`, they receive the same rank.

What is the PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) for wallet transactions in the last 2 months excluding the current month?PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) = distinct sender with  sender_type = 0. Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",Ewallet,"The query aims to calculate the Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) for wallet transactions over the last two full months, excluding the current month. Based on the provided definition, PMDAU is taken to mean the count of distinct senders (where `sender_type = 0`) who made transactions within each respective month. The `created_at` timestamp is truncated to the start of the month for aggregation.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates the date boundaries for the period of interest.
    *   `current_month_boundary`: The start of the current month. Transactions on or after this date are excluded.
    *   `start_period_boundary`: The start of the month that was two months before the current month. Transactions on or after this date (and before `current_month_boundary`) are included.
    *   For example, if today is July 15th, 2023, `current_month_boundary` would be 2023-07-01, and `start_period_boundary` would be 2023-05-01. The query would consider transactions from May 1st, 2023, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2023 (i.e., transactions in May and June).

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions**:
    *   It accesses the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0`.
    *   Filters transactions to fall within the calculated date range (`>= start_period_boundary` and `< current_month_boundary`).
    *   For each of these filtered transactions, it calculates `transaction_month_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the first day of its month. This field will be used for grouping.

3.  **Calculate PMDAU per Month**:
    *   The prepared transaction data is then partitioned by `transaction_month_start`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `year_val`: The year of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `month_val`: The month number of the `transaction_month_start`.
        *   `pmdau`: The number of distinct `sender_id` values within that month's transactions. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by year and then by month for a clear, chronological presentation.

This approach directly implements the definition ""PMDAU = distinct sender with sender\_type = 0"" and ""Truncate created\_at to month for aggregation"", interpreting PMDAU as the count of unique active users per month for the specified period.

1.  **Filter and Calculate Individual Session Durations**:

    *   For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We'll name this `calculated_session_duration`.
    *   Ensure `user_id` is carried forward for partitioning.

2.  **Group by User and Aggregate Durations**:
    *   Partition the resulting collection by `user_id`. Let's name the partition group `user_partition_group`.
    *   For each user (each group in the partition), calculate the sum of `calculated_session_duration` from all their sessions in the filtered range. This gives the total session duration per user.

3.  **Order and Select Final Output**:
    *   Order the aggregated results by the total session duration in descending order (longest duration first).
    *   Select the `user_id` and the calculated total duration, renaming them as required by the prompt.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable stores the result of filtering `UserSessions`. It includes only those sessions that started between June 1, 2023 (inclusive) and June 8, 2023 (exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_session_duration` which is the duration of that single session in seconds. The `user_id` is also explicitly selected to be used as a key in the next step.
2.  `user_aggregated_data`: This step takes `sessions_with_duration` and partitions it by `user_id`.
    *   `name=""user_partition_group""` gives a name to the groups within the partition.
    *   `by=(user_id)` specifies that sessions should be grouped based on their `user_id`.
    *   In the subsequent `CALCULATE` clause:
        *   `user_id_key=user_id` selects the partitioning key (the user's ID).
        *   `summed_duration_seconds=SUM(user_partition_group.calculated_session_duration)` calculates the total session time for each user by summing up the `calculated_session_duration` of all sessions belonging to that user within the partition group.
3.  `sorted_user_durations`: The data is then sorted by `summed_duration_seconds` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.
4.  `result`: Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested by the prompt. The `total_duration` will be an integer value representing seconds.",75.03630375862122,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by date and calculate duration for each session.

1.  Determine the date range for the ""previous month"". We'll define this as the period from the start of the last month up to (but not including) the start of the current month.
2.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those that:
    *   Occurred within the determined previous month.
    *   Are ""wallet transactions"". We'll assume this means `transaction_type == ""WALLET""`.
3.  From this filtered set, count the total number of transactions.
4.  Also, count the number of ""successful"" transactions. We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status == ""completed""`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_date` and `current_month_start_date`: These variables define the time window for the ""previous month"". `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')` calculates the first moment of the month preceding the current one. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the first moment of the current month. Transactions are selected if their `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `prev_month_start_date` and before `current_month_start_date`.
2.  `previous_month_wallet_transactions_filtered`: This intermediate step filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It selects transactions within the defined date range.
    *   It further filters for transactions where `transaction_type == ""WALLET""`. This assumes that ""WALLET"" is the value in the `transaction_type` field that identifies wallet transactions.
3.  `str_calculation_result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top `Ewallet` graph level.
    *   `num_successful_txns`: Counts transactions from `previous_month_wallet_transactions_filtered` where `status == ""completed""`. This assumes ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction.
    *   `num_total_txns`: Counts all transactions within `previous_month_wallet_transactions_filtered`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(previous_month_str = ...)`: This second `CALCULATE` takes the counts from the previous step to compute the final STR.
    *   `previous_month_str`: This field will hold the calculated Success Transaction Rate.
    *   `IFF(num_total_txns > 0, num_successful_txns / num_total_txns, 0.0)`: This expression calculates the STR. If `num_total_txns` is greater than 0, it divides `num_successful_txns` by `num_total_txns`. Otherwise (if `num_total_txns` is 0, to prevent division by zero), it defaults to `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
    *   `LOWER(country) == 'us'`: This condition filters users whose country is 'US', ignoring case.
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider users who have at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: We look into the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`: This filters notifications to include only those that are 'promotional' and 'unread'.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if there's at least one such notification for the user.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the users who passed the `WHERE` clause filters, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username` and renames it to `user_name`.
    *   `num_unread_promo_notifications=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of notifications for each selected user that match the criteria (`notification_type == 'promotional'` and `status == 'unread'`) and names this count `num_unread_promo_notifications`. The `COUNT` function here will count the specific notifications for the users already confirmed to have them by the `HAS` condition.",19.279381036758423,"result = Users.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `relevant_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table.
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Selects transactions only from the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Ensures that the sender is a user, not a merchant.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successful transactions.
    *   `(HAS(sending_user) == 1) & (sending_user.status == ""active"")`: Ensures the transaction is linked to a sending user and that this user is 'active'.

2.  `transactions_for_partition`: This takes the `relevant_transactions` and adds a new calculated field `tx_month_date`.
    *   `tx_month_date = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`: This function converts the `created_at` timestamp of each transaction to a datetime representing the first day of that transaction's month. This standardized date will be used for grouping.

3.  `monthly_summary`: This line performs the core aggregation.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(tx_month_date))`: Groups the `transactions_for_partition` data by the `tx_month_date`. Each group will contain all relevant transactions for a specific month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each monthly group:
        *   `month_as_date = tx_month_date`: Selects the month (which is already the start date of the month, fulfilling the ""month as a date"" requirement).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_id` values within each monthly group. `Transactions.sender_id` here refers to the `sender_id` of the transactions that belong to the current partition (i.e., specific month and met all prior filters).

4.  `result`: This line sorts the `monthly_summary`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month_as_date.ASC())`: Orders the monthly counts chronologically from the earliest month in 2023 to the latest.

The final `result` will contain two columns: `month_as_date` (the first day of each month in 2023 that had relevant activity) and `num_distinct_users` (the count of unique active users who sent successful transactions in that month).",57.75695466995239,"# Step 1: Filter transactions for active users sending money successfully in 2023

**Explanation:**

1.  `users_with_qualifying_transactions`: This line filters the `Users` collection. It keeps only those users who have at least one sent transaction (`transactions_sent`) where the `sender_type` is `0`. The `HAS` function checks for the existence of such transactions.
2.  `country_based_aggregation`:
    *   This takes the filtered users and partitions them by their `country` attribute. Each partition (`country_groups`) represents a unique country.
    *   Within the `CALCULATE` clause for each country partition:
        *   `country_name=country`: The country name is selected.
        *   `num_distinct_senders=COUNT(Users.uid)`: This counts the number of unique users (by their `uid`) within the current country partition. Since these users are already filtered to be senders of type 0 transactions, this gives the number of distinct users who sent from that country.
        *   `total_user_sent_amount=SUM(Users.transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0).amount)`: This calculates the sum of transaction amounts. It accesses the `transactions_sent` for all users in the current country partition, filters these transactions again for `sender_type == 0` (to ensure only relevant transactions are summed if a user had other types too), and then sums their `amount`.
3.  `top_5_countries_by_sent_amount`: This line takes the aggregated data per country and selects the top 5 countries based on the `total_user_sent_amount`, ordered in descending order.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` formats the output to match the requested column names: `country`, `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent`, and `total_transaction_amount`.",48.389679193496704,"# Step 1: Filter users who have sent transactions with sender_type = 0.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter these merchants to include only those whose `status` is ""active"" and whose `category` string contains ""retail"".
3.  For this filtered set of merchants, access their associated wallet balances from the `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `MerchantBalances`).
4.  Calculate the median of these `balance` amounts.
5.  The term ""today's"" is interpreted as the median of the current balances at the time of the query, rather than filtering balances updated strictly on the current calendar day. The `MerchantBalances.balance` field is assumed to hold the current wallet balance.
6.  The final result will be a single value representing this median.

    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Ewallet` collection because we want to compute a single aggregate value (the median balance).
2.  `todays_median_retail_merchant_balance=...`: This defines the name of the field that will hold our calculated median value.
3.  `MEDIAN(...)`: This aggregation function calculates the median of the numerical values provided to it.
4.  `Merchants.WHERE((status == ""active"") & CONTAINS(category, ""retail""))`:
    *   This part filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == ""active""`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, ""retail"")`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring ""retail"".
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only merchants satisfying both are selected.
5.  `.balances`: After filtering the merchants, `.balances` accesses the `MerchantBalances` records associated with these specific merchants. This will be a collection of balance records.
6.  `.balance`: From these `MerchantBalances` records, `.balance` extracts the actual numerical balance values, resulting in a collection of numbers.
7.  The `MEDIAN` function then computes the median of this collection of balance amounts from the active retail merchants.",34.53307366371155,"result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

1.  Filter the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only snapshots taken in the year 2023.
2.  From these 2023 snapshots, identify the earliest ones. We use the `RANKING` function, ordering by `snapshot_date` in ascending order. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest date, all are included.
3.  Finally, calculate the average of `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` for these earliest snapshots. This is done using a `CALCULATE` operation on the `Ewallet` collection, applying the `AVG` aggregation function.

It uses the `RANKING` function to assign a rank to each snapshot based on its `snapshot_date` in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection `session_durations`.

    *   `duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: We calculate the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function and name this new calculated field `duration_seconds`.

2.  **`average_session_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `session_durations` collection (which now includes `device_type` and `duration_seconds`).

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, calculate a timestamp representing the end of their first year. This is done by adding one year to their `created_at` (sign-up) date. We'll alias the necessary fields (`username`, `email`, `created_at`) for clarity and later use.
3.  Filter these users. A user is kept if they have no notifications (`notifications` sub-collection) whose `created_at` date falls before this calculated one-year mark. This is achieved using `HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0`. This condition correctly includes users with no notifications at all, as well as users whose notifications all occurred after their first year.
4.  Finally, select the `username`, `email`, and the original `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`) for the users who meet the criteria.

```python
users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
    # Alias fields from the Users collection for clarity and use in subsequent operations
    user_username = username,
    user_email = email,
    user_signup_date = created_at,
    # Calculate the marker for the end of the user's first year
    end_of_first_year_marker = DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')
).WHERE(
    # Filter users: keep those who have NO notifications (HAS(...) == 0)
    # where the notification's creation date is before the end_of_first_year_marker.
    # This covers users with no notifications at all, or users whose notifications are all after the first year.
    HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0
).CALCULATE(
    # Select the requested fields for the output
    username = user_username,
    email = user_email,
    signup_date = user_signup_date
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We begin by processing the `Users` collection. In this step, we:
    *   Alias `username` to `user_username`, `email` to `user_email`, and `created_at` to `user_signup_date`. This helps in clearly referencing these values later.
    *   Calculate `end_of_first_year_marker`: For each user, this new field stores the timestamp exactly one year after their `created_at` date (sign-up date), using the `DATETIME` function.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)) == 0)`: This filters the users based on their notification history.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at < end_of_first_year_marker)`: For each user, this filters their associated `notifications` to include only those created *before* the `end_of_first_year_marker` (i.e., within their first year).
    *   `HAS(...)`: This function checks if the filtered set of notifications (those within the first year) has any records. It returns `1` (True) if there's at least one such notification, and `0` (False) otherwise.
    *   `... == 0`: The overall condition keeps users for whom `HAS(...)` is `0`, meaning they have no notifications that were created within their first year of signing up.

3.  `.CALCULATE(username = user_username, email = user_email, signup_date = user_signup_date)`: For the users who passed the filter, this step selects and formats the final output:
    *   `username`: The user's username.
    *   `email`: The user's email.
    *   `signup_date`: The user's original sign-up date (`created_at`).",38.19085383415222,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.CALCULATE(
