).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**:
    *   This part starts by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   It then filters these customers using the `WHERE` clause to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each customer that meets the criteria from the `WHERE` clause, this step calculates two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the customer and assigns it to `customer_name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: This calculates the transaction success rate.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"" (assuming ""Completed"" signifies a successful transaction).
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express the rate as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate` for eligible customers) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.

The query effectively identifies customers with a minimum transaction volume and then computes and orders them by their transaction success rate.",22.34766459465027,"result = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter customers whose `email` address ends with "".com"".
4.  Further filter these customers to include only those who have made at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols. The `HAS` function combined with `ISIN` will be used for this.
5.  Count the number of such distinct customers using the `COUNT` function on the filtered customer set.
6.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, calculated at the `Broker` graph level.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_who_bought_faang = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))`: This filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_symbols` list (using `ISIN`).
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This ensures that the customer has at least one such transaction.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
        *   `join_date >= ""2023-01-01""`: This selects customers who joined on or after January 1, 2023.
        *   `status == ""Active""`: This further filters for customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result, `filtered_customers`, is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., the TAC).

2.  **`tac_per_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))` groups these customers by the `country` field. Each group in `country_groups` will contain customers from the same country.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`**:
    *   This operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `country=country`: This selects the `country` field for the output. Since `country` was a partitioning key, it can be directly referenced.
    *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: This calculates the number of customers within each country group. `COUNT(Customers)` here refers to counting the records in the `Customers` sub-collection implicitly available for each partition. This gives us the ""Total Active Customers"" count for that specific country.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the relevant 8-week period. This period starts 56 days (8 weeks) before the beginning of the current week and ends just before the current week begins.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that:
    *   Are for ""stock"" tickers. We'll assume the `ticker_type` field in the `Tickers` collection is 'stock' for this purpose.
    *   Fall within the defined 8-week time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected transaction, we calculate a standardized week identifier (`week_start_iso`). This is the start date of the week the transaction belongs to, formatted as ""YYYY-MM-DD"" for clear grouping and sorting.
4.  **Group by Week**: We partition (group) these transactions by the `week_start_iso`.
5.  **Calculate Counts per Week**: For each week group:
    *   `total_stock_txns`: We count all transactions belonging to that group.
    *   `weekend_stock_txns`: We count transactions within that group where the `date_time` falls on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", determined using the `DAYNAME()` function.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by the week identifier in descending order, showing the most recent of the 8 weeks first.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1.  `start_of_current_week` and `eight_weeks_ago_from_start_of_current_week`: These lines define the boundaries for our 8-week analysis period, ensuring we exclude the current week.
2.  `transactions_for_partitioning`:
    *   This variable holds transactions that meet our initial criteria:
        *   `Transactions.ticker.ticker_type == ""stock""`: Filters for transactions related to stocks. (Note: The actual value for 'stock' in `ticker_type` might vary, e.g., ""STK"", ""Equity"". ""stock"" is assumed here).
        *   The `date_time` conditions ensure transactions are within the desired 8-week window.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these transactions, it computes `week_start_iso`.
        *   `DATETIME(Transactions.date_time, 'start of week')` truncates the transaction's timestamp to the start of its week.
        *   `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` are used to format this week-start-date into a ""YYYY-MM-DD"" string, which serves as a unique identifier for each week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_counts`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=(week_start_iso))`: This groups the `transactions_for_partitioning` by the `week_start_iso`. Each group represents one of the 8 weeks.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_identifier = week_start_iso`: Selects the week identifier.
        *   `total_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts all transactions within that specific week's group. `Transactions` here refers to the records from the base `Transactions` collection that fall into the current partition group and meet the initial filtering criteria.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns = COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(Transactions.date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts transactions within the current week's group where the `DAYNAME()` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_identifier.DESC())`: Sorts the weekly summaries, showing the most recent week first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Boundary Definition**:
    *   The first `CALCULATE` call on the `Broker` collection defines two helper variables:
        *   `_internal_start_of_last_week`: This is calculated as the start of the current week minus 7 days, effectively giving the start date of the previous week. For example, if ""now"" is a Wednesday and the week starts on Monday, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` would be the Monday of the current week. Subtracting 7 days (`'-7 days'`) gives the Monday of the previous week.
        *   `_internal_start_of_this_week`: This is calculated as the start of the current week.
    *   These variables establish the date range for ""last week"" as `[_internal_start_of_last_week, _internal_start_of_this_week)`. The start is inclusive, and the end is exclusive.

2.  **Transaction Filtering and Aggregation**:
    *   The second `CALCULATE` call uses the date boundaries defined in the first `CALCULATE`.
    *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")`: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `country` is ""USA"".
    *   `.transactions_made`: For these US customers, it accesses their associated transactions.
    *   `.WHERE((date_time >= _internal_start_of_last_week) & (date_time < _internal_start_of_this_week))`: This filters the transactions to include only those where the `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" range defined earlier.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions that meet all the above criteria (US customer, transaction occurred last week).
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(...).amount`: Sums the `amount` field of these filtered transactions.

3.  **Final Output**:
    *   The query returns a single record with two fields: `num_transactions` (the total count of transactions made by US customers last week) and `total_transaction_amount` (the sum of the amounts of these transactions).",47.0268452167511,"result = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   It uses the `CALCULATE` method to derive new fields for each customer:
        *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's `name` and renames it to `customer_name`.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with each customer using the `COUNT` aggregation function on the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
        *   `total_trans_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by each customer using the `SUM` aggregation function.

2.  **`result = customer_transaction_summary.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_summary` (which now includes `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` for each customer).
    *   It applies another `CALCULATE` method to:
        *   Select the previously calculated fields: `customer_name`, `num_transactions`.
        *   Rename `total_trans_amount` to `total_transaction_amount` for the final output.
        *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the customer rank (CR).
            *   `RANKING(...)` is a window function that assigns a rank to each customer.
            *   `by=total_trans_amount.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `total_trans_amount` field in descending order. This means the customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1.

The final `result` will be a collection where each record represents a customer and includes their name, total number of transactions, total transaction amount, and their rank (CR) based on the total transaction amount.",22.46683168411255,"customer_transaction_summary = Customers.CALCULATE(

What are the 2 most frequently bought stock ticker symbols in the past 10 days? Return the ticker symbol and number of buy transactions.,"WITH popular_stocks AS (SELECT t.sbTickerSymbol, COUNT(*) AS tx_count FROM sbTransaction AS tx JOIN sbTicker AS t ON tx.sbTxTickerId = t.sbTickerId WHERE tx.sbTxType = 'buy' AND tx.sbTxDateTime >= DATE('now', '-10 days') GROUP BY t.sbTickerSymbol) SELECT sbTickerSymbol, tx_count FROM popular_stocks ORDER BY tx_count DESC LIMIT 2;",Broker,"To find the 2 most frequently bought stock ticker symbols in the past 10 days, we will perform the following steps:
1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with `transaction_type == ""BUY""`.
2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred within the ""past 10 days"". We interpret ""past 10 days"" as today and the 9 preceding days. This can be achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 9`.
3.  For each of these filtered transactions, we extract the `ticker.symbol`.
4.  We then group these transactions by the `ticker_symbol_val` using `PARTITION`.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we count the number of transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
6.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions.
