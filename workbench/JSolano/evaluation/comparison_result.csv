1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. This can be checked by counting the `transactions_made` for each customer.
3.  For the filtered customers, calculate their success rate. We'll define a successful transaction as one where the `status` field in the `Transactions` collection (aliased as `transactions_made` here) is ""Completed"". The success rate will be `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100`.
4.  Select the customer's name and their calculated success rate.
5.  Order the results by the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).

).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers.
    *   `COUNT(transactions_made)` counts the total number of transactions for each customer.
    *   The condition `COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5` ensures that only customers with 5 or more transactions are considered.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This function is applied to the filtered set of customers.
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the customer and renames it to `customer_name`.
    *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) * 100.0) / COUNT(transactions_made)`: Calculates the success rate.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: Counts the number of transactions for the customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This represents the number of successful transactions.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer (this will be >= 5 due to the preceding `WHERE` clause).
        *   The ratio of successful transactions to total transactions is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by the calculated `success_rate`.
    *   `.ASC()` specifies ascending order, so customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.",22.93603038787841,"customer_transaction_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(

2.  For each customer, calculate two aggregate values:

    *   The number of successful transactions they've made (`num_successful_transactions`). We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` is ""Completed"".
3.  Filter these customers to include only those where `num_total_transactions` is 5 or more.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate their `success_rate` as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. We use `IFF` to handle potential division by zero, although the filter `num_total_transactions >= 5` already ensures the divisor is positive. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and uses floating-point arithmetic.
5.  Select the customer's name and their calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Order the final result by `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

        *   `transaction_week_start`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred (using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`).
        *   `is_weekend_txn`: A flag (1 if weekend, 0 if weekday) determined by checking if `DAYNAME(date_time)` is 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.

4.  **Filter for Relevant Weeks**:
    *   The transactions are then filtered to include only those whose `transaction_week_start` falls within the last 8 weeks, excluding the current week. This is achieved by the condition:
        `(transaction_week_start < current_week_start_val) & (transaction_week_start >= eight_weeks_ago_start_val)`.

5.  **Group by Week and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered transactions are partitioned by `transaction_week_start`.
    *   For each week (each partition group), it calculates:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (the partition key).
        *   `total_stock_txns`: The total count of stock transactions in that week using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns`: The count of stock transactions that occurred on a weekend in that week, by summing the `is_weekend_txn` flag (`SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_txn)`).

6.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

2.  **Calculate Week Information**: For each stock transaction:
    *   Determine the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. The definition of ""start of week"" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the system's date configuration.
    *   Flag whether the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

This query will output a row for each of the specified 8 weeks that had at least one stock transaction, showing the week's start date, the total count of stock transactions, and the count of those that were on a weekend.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the date range for ""last week"".
    *   `_current_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date (and time) of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `_last_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date (and time) of the previous week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week, using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`.
    The ""last week"" period will be from `_last_week_start_dt` (inclusive) to `_current_week_start_dt` (exclusive).

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   We start by accessing `Customers` and filter them where their `country` is ""USA"".
    *   Then, we access their `transactions_made`.
    *   These transactions are further filtered to include only those where the `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" range defined in step 1. This collection of transactions is stored in the `filtered_transactions_usa_last_week` variable.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   Finally, we use `Broker.CALCULATE` to compute the required aggregates from the `filtered_transactions_usa_last_week` collection:
        *   `num_transactions`: Counts the total number of transactions in the filtered set using `COUNT()`.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: Sums the `amount` for all transactions in the filtered set using `SUM()`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection. The first `CALCULATE` is used to define two helper variables:
    *   `_start_of_current_week_dt`: Stores the timestamp for the beginning of the current week.
    *   `_start_of_last_week_dt`: Stores the timestamp for the beginning of the previous week.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` clause computes the final results:
    *   `num_of_transactions`:
        *   `Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"")`: Filters for customers whose country is ""USA"".
        *   `.transactions_made`: Accesses the transactions made by these USA customers.
        *   `.WHERE((date_time >= _start_of_last_week_dt) & (date_time < _start_of_current_week_dt))`: Filters these transactions to include only those that occurred on or after the start of last week and before the start of the current week.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions that meet all these criteria.
    *   `total_trans_amount`:
        *   The filtering logic is identical to `num_of_transactions` to identify the same set of transactions.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of these amounts.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions where `transaction_type` is ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these buy transactions to include only those that occurred ""in the past 10 days"". We interpret ""past 10 days"" as today and the 9 preceding calendar days. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) < 10`, which counts transactions that happened less than 10 full 24-hour periods ago from the current moment.
3.  For each of these filtered transactions, we extract the `symbol` of the associated `ticker`.
4.  Group the resulting records by the `ticker.symbol`.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), count the number of buy transactions.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need to identify customers whose `join_date` falls within the last 6 full months prior to the current month.
    *   `start_of_current_month`: This will be the first day of the current month.
    *   `start_of_lookback_period`: This will be the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month.
    *   The relevant `join_date` range will be `>= start_of_lookback_period` and `< start_of_current_month`.

2.  **Prepare Customer Data**:
    *   Filter `Customers` based on the `join_date` falling into the defined time window.
    *   For these customers, extract the year and month of their `join_date` to be used for grouping. Let's call these `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`.

3.  **Partition by Signup Month**:
    *   Group the filtered customers by `signup_yr` and `signup_mth` using the `PARTITION` function.

4.  **Calculate Metrics (PMCS and PMAT)**:
    *   For each group (i.e., each signup month):
        *   **PMCS**: Count the number of customers in that group. This can be done using `COUNT(Customers)`.
        *   **PMAT**: Calculate the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in that group. This can be done using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This will average over all individual transaction amounts from the customers who signed up in that specific month.

5.  **Order Results**: Optionally, order the results by signup year and month for better readability.

```python
# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions
start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
start_of_lookback_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month` and `start_of_lookback_period`: These variables define the date range for customer signups. `start_of_lookback_period` marks the beginning of the 6-month window (e.g., if today is July 15th, this would be January 1st). `start_of_current_month` marks the end of this window (exclusive, e.g., July 1st).
2.  `customers_with_signup_info`: We first access the `Customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to add new fields `signup_yr` (year of join date) and `signup_mth` (month of join date), while also keeping `cust_join_date` (the original join date) for filtering.
3.  `filtered_customers_for_period`: This step filters the augmented customer data to include only those customers whose `cust_join_date` falls within our defined 6-month window.
4.  `customer_signup_monthly_groups`: The filtered customers are then partitioned into groups based on their `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`. Each group represents a cohort of customers who signed up in the same month.
5.  `monthly_metrics`: For each `monthly_signup_cohort` (partition):
    *   `signup_year` and `signup_month` are carried over from the partition keys.
    *   `pmcs` (Per Month Customer Signups) is calculated as `COUNT(Customers)`, which counts the number of customers in the current signup cohort.
    *   `pmat` (Per Month Average Transaction Amount) is calculated as `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions made by the customers in the current signup cohort and computes the average of their `amount` values.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `signup_year` and `signup_month` for clarity.",56.61180186271668,"# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions

1.  **Annotate Daily Prices**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, we retrieve the `ticker_type` from its related `ticker` and the `date` of the price record. The `close` price is also implicitly available.
2.  **Filter by Date**: We filter these annotated daily price records to include only those where the `date` falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today.

We interpret an ""Active Customer"" as a customer whose `status` field is 'Active'. This interpretation leverages the available `status` field in the `Customers` collection and gives distinct meaning to both ""Active Customer"" and ""with Transactions"" parts of the definition.

The PyDough code will perform the following steps:
1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered customers, determine two boolean flags:
    *   `is_active_with_transactions_flag`: True if the customer's `status` is 'Active' AND they have at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made)`). This corresponds to the customers counted in the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has at least one transaction. This corresponds to the customers counted in the denominator.
3.  Partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country, sum the flags calculated in step 2 to get:
    *   `numerator_count`: The total number of active customers with transactions.
    *   `denominator_count`: The total number of customers with transactions.
5.  Calculate the AR for each country using the formula. If `denominator_count` is zero, AR will be set to 0.0 to avoid division by zero and indicate no relevant transaction activity.
6.  The final result will include the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_filtered_and_flagged`:
    *   This expression starts by filtering the `Customers` collection to retain only customers who joined in the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`).
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered customers:
        *   `cust_country = country`: Selects the customer's country, aliasing it to `cust_country` for use as a partitioning key.
        *   `is_active_with_transactions_flag`: This boolean flag is `True` if a customer's `status` is 'Active' AND they have one or more transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This identifies customers contributing to the AR numerator.
        *   `has_transactions_flag`: This boolean flag is `True` if a customer has one or more transactions. This identifies customers contributing to the AR denominator.

2.  `country_aggregates`:
    *   This expression takes `customers_filtered_and_flagged` and partitions it by `cust_country` (the customer's country). Each partition group (`country_partition`) contains customers from a specific country.
    *   `CALCULATE` then operates on each country's group:
        *   `country_name_output = cust_country`: Preserves the country name for the final output.
        *   `numerator_count = SUM(is_active_with_transactions_flag)`: Counts how many customers in that country are 'Active' and have transactions by summing the `is_active_with_transactions_flag`.
        *   `denominator_count = SUM(has_transactions_flag)`: Counts how many customers in that country have transactions by summing the `has_transactions_flag`.

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country` (assigned to `result`):
    *   This final `CALCULATE` computes the Activity Ratio for each country from the aggregated counts.
    *   `country = country_name_output`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR = IFF(denominator_count > 0, (numerator_count * 100.0) / denominator_count, 0.0)`: Calculates the AR.
        *   `IFF(denominator_count > 0, ..., 0.0)`: This conditional logic prevents division by zero. If `denominator_count` (total customers with transactions) is greater than 0, AR is calculated as `(numerator_count * 100.0) / denominator_count`. The `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage.
        *   If `denominator_count` is 0 (meaning no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), AR is set to `0.0`.

3.  We then partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `active_with_tx_bool` flag. This counts customers who are active and have transactions. This forms the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `num_total_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `has_tx_bool` flag. This counts all customers who have transactions. This forms the denominator of the AR formula.
    (We assume `SUM` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, consistent with PyDough examples like `SUM(cust_info.is_active)`).
5.  Finally, we calculate the Activity Ratio (AR) using the provided formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `num_total_customers_with_transactions` is zero (i.e., no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), setting AR to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

2.  Convert the `name` field to lowercase using `LOWER()` for case-insensitive matching.
3.  Check if the lowercase name starts with ""j"" using `STARTSWITH()` OR ends with ""ez"" using `ENDSWITH()`.
4.  Convert the `state` field to lowercase using `LOWER()` for case-insensitive matching.
5.  Check if the lowercase state ends with ""a"" using `ENDSWITH()`.
6.  Combine these conditions using logical AND (`&`) and OR (`|`) operators within a `WHERE` clause.
7.  Count the resulting customers using `COUNT()`.
8.  Assign this count to a field in a `Broker.CALCULATE()` call to get a single result.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used to compute a single aggregated value from the `Customers` collection.
2.  `number_of_customers=COUNT(...)`: We are calculating a new field `number_of_customers` which will hold the count of customers meeting the criteria.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Customers` collection based on the specified conditions.
4.  `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's name to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
5.  `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"")`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with ""j"".
6.  `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with ""ez"".
7.  `(... | ...)`: The OR operator combines the two name conditions. A customer satisfies this part if their name starts with ""j"" OR ends with ""ez"".
8.  `LOWER(state)`: Converts the customer's state to lowercase.
9.  `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), ""a"")`: Checks if the lowercase state ends with ""a"".
10. `(... & ...)`: The AND operator combines the name condition group with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We are calculating a new field called `num_customers`. The value of this field will be the count of customers who meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.

5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` ends with 'ez'.
6.  **`(... | ...)`**: The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions, so a customer matches if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `state` ends with 'a'.
8.  **`(... & ...)`**: The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition (already an OR) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.

1.  **Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   Start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   For each transaction, calculate necessary fields:
        *   `ticker_sym`: The symbol of the ticker associated with the transaction.
        *   `trans_amount`: The amount of the transaction.
        *   `trans_tax`: The tax amount of the transaction.
        *   `trans_commission`: The commission amount of the transaction.
        *   `trans_type`: The type of the transaction (e.g., ""sell"").
        *   `trans_datetime`: The date and time of the transaction.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those where:
        *   `trans_type` is ""sell"".
        *   `trans_datetime` is within the last month (i.e., greater than or equal to one month ago from the current time). We use `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` to get the date one month ago.

2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the prepared and filtered transactions by `ticker_sym`. This groups all relevant sell transactions for each unique ticker symbol.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol):
        *   Calculate `total_amount_from_sells_calc`: This is the sum of `trans_amount` for all transactions in the group.
        *   Calculate `total_tax_plus_commission_calc`: This is the sum of (`trans_tax` + `trans_commission`) for all transactions in the group. To do this, we first calculate `cost_item = trans_tax + trans_commission` for each transaction within the group and then sum these `cost_item` values.

3.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, calculate the SPM for each ticker symbol.
    *   The SPM formula is: `(Total Amount from Sells - (Tax + Commission)) / Total Amount from Sells * 100`.
    *   In our terms: `(total_amount_from_sells_calc - total_tax_plus_commission_calc) / total_amount_from_sells_calc * 100.0`.
    *   We must handle the case where `total_amount_from_sells_calc` is zero to prevent division by zero. In such cases, SPM will be set to `0.0`.

4.  **Format Output**:
    *   The final result should include the `ticker_symbol` and its calculated `spm_value`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the PyDough code:

1.  **`daily_prices_enhanced`**:
    *   Starts with the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Extract the ticker symbol (`ticker_s_field`) from the related `ticker` record.
        *   Extract the year (`year_field`) and month (`month_field`) from the `date`.
        *   Alias the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices to new field names (`close_price_field`, `high_price_field`, `low_price_field`) for clarity in subsequent steps.

2.  **`ticker_group_partition`**:
    *   Partitions the `daily_prices_enhanced` data by `ticker_s_field`.
    *   The `name=""ticker_level_group""` assigns a name to these ticker-specific groups, which will be used later by the `PREV` function's `per` argument.

3.  **`month_level_partition_for_ticker`**:
    *   This operates on the sub-collection of daily prices within each `ticker_level_group` (i.e., for each specific ticker).
    *   It further partitions this ticker-specific daily data by `year_field` and `month_field`.
    *   `name=""month_level_group""` names these monthly groups within each ticker.

4.  **`monthly_aggregates`**:
    *   `CALCULATE` is applied to `month_level_partition_for_ticker`. For each month within each ticker:
        *   It carries forward the `ticker_s_field` (as `ticker_symbol_val`), `year_field` (as `year_val`), and `month_field` (as `month_val`).
        *   It calculates the average closing price (`avg_close_val`), maximum high price (`max_high_val`), and minimum low price (`min_low_val`) for that month using aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) on the corresponding fields from `daily_prices_enhanced` that fall into the current month's group.

5.  **`results_with_momc`**:
    *   This `CALCULATE` is applied to the `monthly_aggregates` (which contains one row per ticker per month with monthly stats).
    *   It selects and renames the ticker symbol, formats the month string as ""YYYY-MM"" (`month_output_str`), and includes the calculated monthly aggregates.
    *   Crucially, it calculates `prev_month_avg_close` using the `PREV` window function:
        *   `PREV(avg_close_val, ...)` gets the `avg_close_val` from the previous row.
        *   `by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC())` ensures rows are ordered chronologically before `PREV` is applied.
        *   `per=""ticker_level_group""` is essential: it tells `PREV` to reset its calculation for each new ticker group (defined by `ticker_group_partition`). This ensures the ""previous month"" is correctly identified within the same ticker.
        *   `default=None` handles the first month for each ticker, where there's no previous month.
    *   It then calculates `momc_calc` using the formula `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`. `IFF` is used to handle cases where `prev_month_avg_close` is `None` (first month) or zero (to prevent division by zero errors), returning `None` in such scenarios.

6.  **`final_report`**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`, and `MoMC`.

```python
# Step 1: Enhance DailyPrices with ticker symbol, year, and month, and alias price fields

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",112.98786568641664,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

2.  For each daily price record, extract the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the date, high price, and low price. We'll alias these for clarity (e.g., `ticker_s`, `price_date`, `high_p`, `low_p`). This effectively joins ticker information with daily prices.
3.  Filter these records to include only those where `price_date` is between ""2023-04-01"" and ""2023-04-04"", inclusive.
4.  Group (partition) the filtered records by the `ticker_s` (ticker symbol). This ensures we are looking at distinct stocks.
5.  For each distinct stock (each partition group):
    *   Calculate the overall highest high price (`period_max_high`) within the date range for that stock using `MAX(high_p)`.
    *   Calculate the overall lowest low price (`period_min_low`) within the date range for that stock using `MIN(low_p)`.
    *   Calculate the `price_difference` as `period_max_high - period_min_low`.
6.  From these per-stock price differences, select the top 3 stocks ordered by `price_difference` in descending order using `TOP_K`.
7.  Finally, select and return the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `price_change`.

This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  `prices_with_symbol_and_dates`: It starts by accessing `DailyPrices` and uses `CALCULATE` to include the `ticker_symbol` (from the related `Tickers` table via the `ticker` relationship), `ticker_id`, `date` (as `price_date`), `low` (as `low_price`), and `high` (as `high_price`).
2.  `filtered_prices`: It filters these records using `WHERE` to retain only those where `price_date` falls between ""2023-04-01"" and ""2023-04-04"", inclusive.
3.  `stock_performance_summary`: It then partitions the `filtered_prices` by `ticker_id` and `ticker_symbol`. For each distinct stock (each partition group named `stock_group`), it calculates the `overall_min_low` (the minimum of `low_price` within that group over the period) and `overall_max_high` (the maximum of `high_price`).
4.  `stock_price_changes`: This step calculates the `price_change_value` for each stock by subtracting `overall_min_low` from `overall_max_high`.
5.  `top_3_stocks_by_price_change`: It uses `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_value.DESC())` to select the 3 stocks with the highest `price_change_value`.
6.  `result`: Finally, it uses `CALCULATE` to output only the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `price_change` for these top 3 stocks.",41.67236542701721,"# Step 1 & 2: Access DailyPrices and include ticker symbol, date, low, and high

    *   `num_tx_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This counts the transactions for the current customer that satisfy a specific condition.

        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions made in the same month and year as the customer's `join_date` are counted. `date_time` refers to the transaction's timestamp, and `join_date` refers to the customer's signup date.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_tx_in_join_month.DESC())`: After calculating `num_tx_in_join_month` for all customers, this operation selects the top 1 customer based on this count in descending order. This effectively gives us the customer with the highest number of transactions in their signup month.

2.  **Group by Transaction Type**: The filtered transactions are then grouped by `transaction_type` using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each transaction type, we calculate:
    *   The number of distinct customers involved, using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`.
    *   The average number of shares transacted, using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`.
    The `transaction_type` itself is also selected from the partition key.

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(transaction_type == 'buy')`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to retain only records where the `transaction_type` field is equal to 'buy'.
2.  `.PARTITION(name=""distinct_customers"", by=(customer_id))`: This takes the filtered 'buy' transactions and groups them by the `customer_id`. The `name=""distinct_customers""` assigns a temporary name to these groups, though it's not directly used in the final `CALCULATE` for this specific query. The key part is `by=(customer_id)`, which ensures that subsequent operations will process each unique `customer_id` once.
3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)`: This step operates on the result of the `PARTITION`.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection, as each record in `Tickers` represents a unique ticker.
2.  Filter these tickers to find those that have at least one associated `DailyPrices` record (via the `historical_prices` sub-collection) meeting the date condition. The `HAS` function is suitable for this.
3.  The date condition is that the `date` of the daily price record must be on or after April 1, 2023. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to check this: `DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0`.
4.  For the tickers that satisfy this condition, select their unique identifier (`_id`) and present it as `ticker_id`.

```python
result = Tickers.WHERE(
    HAS(historical_prices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0)) == 1
).CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Tickers.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Tickers` collection and apply a filter.
2.  `HAS(historical_prices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0)) == 1`: This is the main filtering condition.
    *   `historical_prices` is a sub-collection of `Tickers` containing `DailyPrices` records for each ticker.
    *   `historical_prices.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date) >= 0)`: This filters the daily price records for each ticker, keeping only those where the `date` is on or after April 1, 2023.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", ""2023-04-01"", date)` calculates the number of full days from ""2023-04-01"" to the `date` of the price record.
        *   If this difference is greater than or equal to 0, it means the `date` is on or after ""2023-04-01"".
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one record in the filtered `historical_prices` sub-collection. If a ticker has at least one daily price record satisfying the date condition, it passes this filter.
3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id)`: For the tickers that pass the filter, this part selects the `_id` field (which is the unique identifier for a ticker in the `Tickers` collection) and renames it to `ticker_id` in the output.

Explanation:
-   `Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates the query on the `Tickers` collection.
    -   `ticker_s=symbol`: Selects the ticker's symbol and assigns it to an intermediate field `ticker_s`.
    -   `total_amount_calc=SUM(transactions_of.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions linked to the current ticker via the `transactions_of` relationship. This sum is stored in `total_amount_calc`.
    -   `num_transactions_calc=COUNT(transactions_of)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the current ticker and stores it in `num_transactions_calc`.
-   `.TOP_K(10, by=total_amount_calc.DESC())`: This function takes the result of the previous `CALCULATE` step (a collection of tickers with their calculated total amounts and transaction counts) and selects the top 10 tickers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_with_country_info`: This variable stores transactions that occurred within the last 30 days.
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 30)`: Filters transactions. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, ...)` calculates the difference in days. We select transactions where this difference is 30 days or less.
    *   `.CALCULATE(cust_country = customer.country)`: For each of these recent transactions, it retrieves the `country` of the associated `customer` and names it `cust_country`.

2.  `country_grouped_transactions`: This variable takes `transactions_with_country_info` and groups the records by `cust_country`.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(cust_country))`: This creates groups of transactions, where each group corresponds to a unique country.

3.  `top_countries_by_amount`: This variable calculates the required aggregates for each country group and then selects the top 5.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each country group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `country_name = cust_country`: Assigns the country name.
        *   `num_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions within that specific country's group.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions within that country's group.
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: Orders the countries by `total_transaction_amount` in descending order and selects the top 5.

I'll assume ""closest"" in your request is a typo and you meant ""closing"".

The query will:
1.  Access the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these prices for the ticker symbol ""VTI"".
3.  Further filter these prices to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". I'm interpreting ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days.
4.  Calculate the minimum `close` price from this filtered set.

    lowest_closing_price=MIN(

            (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)
        ).close
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We use the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
2.  `lowest_closing_price=MIN(...)`: This defines the output field `lowest_closing_price` and assigns it the minimum value of the expression that follows.
3.  `DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This starts with the `DailyPrices` collection and filters it based on conditions.
4.  `(ticker.symbol == ""VTI"")`: This condition filters for records where the `symbol` of the associated `ticker` is ""VTI"".
5.  `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters for records within the last 7 days (today and the 6 previous days).
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current date.
    *   `<= 6` ensures that we include records from today (0 days difference) up to 6 full days ago.
6.  `.close`: After filtering, `.close` accesses the closing prices of the selected `DailyPrices` records.
7.  `MIN(...)`: This aggregation function then finds the minimum value among these closing prices.

This can be achieved by checking if `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` is less than or equal to 6. (0 for today, 1 for yesterday, ..., 6 for 7 days ago).
3.  From these filtered daily prices, calculate the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
4.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (graph) level.

```python

The query needs to count the total number of transactions made by customers who have joined in the last 70 days.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  First, we filter the `Customers` collection to get only those customers whose `join_date` is within the last 70 days from the current date. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this.
2.  From this filtered set of customers, we access their `transactions_made`.
3.  Finally, we count all these transactions to get a single total number. This can be done by performing a `CALCULATE` operation on the `Broker` (the top-level collection).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, 'now') <= 70)`: This part filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, 'now')` calculates the number of days between the customer's `join_date` and the current date (`'now'`).
    *   `<= 70` ensures we only select customers who joined 70 days ago or more recently.
2.  `.transactions_made`: After filtering the customers, this accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection for all these recent customers. This results in a collection of all transactions made by them.
3.  `transactions_from_recent_customers = ...`: The resulting collection of transactions is assigned to the variable `transactions_from_recent_customers`.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This selects only customers who have at least one transaction. `HAS(transactions_made)` checks for the existence of records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: This includes the customer's original `_id` in the result.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: This calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This complex expression retrieves the date and time of the customer's first transaction:
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions.
                *   `RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"")`: Ranks the customer's transactions by their `date_time` in ascending order. The `per=""Customers""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer.
                *   `== 1`: Selects the transaction(s) with the earliest rank (i.e., the first transaction).

**Explanation:**

1.  `q1_2023_successful_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Selects transactions from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions in January, February, or March (the first quarter).
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only transactions marked as ""successful"".
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: For each filtered transaction, a new field `transaction_month` is created, storing the month of the transaction. The original `price` field of these transactions is implicitly available for subsequent operations.

2.  `monthly_avg_transaction_price_q1_2023 = q1_2023_successful_transactions.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the filtered transactions and groups them.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month))`: Groups the `q1_2023_successful_transactions` by the `transaction_month` field. Each group (partition) will contain all successful transactions from a specific month in Q1 2023.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This is applied to each monthly group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month (which is the key of the current partition) for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to the original `Transactions` collection that fall within the current month's partition.

4.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result set by month in ascending order (e.g., January, then February, then March).

The final variable `monthly_avg_transaction_price_q1_2023` will contain a table with two columns: `month` (1, 2, or 3) and `average_transaction_price` for that month in Q1 2023.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures we only consider transactions that were completed successfully.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitute the first quarter.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month_number = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, we create a new field `transaction_month_number` which stores the month of each transaction. The original `price` field from `Transactions` is implicitly available for later aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month_number))`: We then partition the filtered and augmented transactions into groups based on the `transaction_month_number`. Each group will contain all successful transactions for a specific month in Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month_number, average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each partition (i.e., for each month):
    *   `month = transaction_month_number`: We select the month number for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: We calculate the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` of the transactions belonging to the current partition.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the relevant time window.
    *   Calculate the start of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   From this, determine the start date of the oldest week in our range (8 weeks prior to the current week, so 56 days before the start of the current week) and the start date of the most recent week in our range (last week, so 7 days before the start of the current week). These will be `v_min_target_week_start` and `v_max_target_week_start`.

2.  **Filter Sales and Access Payments**:
    *   Start with the `Dealership` collection to access global values like the calculated date boundaries.
    *   Navigate to `Sales` records and filter for those with `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   Access the `payment` sub-collection for these sales, which contains `PaymentsReceived` records.

3.  **Process Each Payment**: For each payment associated with the filtered sales:
    *   Calculate `v_payment_week_start`: the start date of the week in which the payment occurred, using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   Calculate `v_is_weekend_int`: a flag (1 if the payment was on a weekend, 0 otherwise). This is done using `IFF(ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")), 1, 0)`.

4.  **Filter Payments by Time Window**:
    *   Filter the processed payments to include only those where `v_payment_week_start` falls within our defined 8-week window (i.e., `v_payment_week_start >= v_min_target_week_start` and `v_payment_week_start <= v_max_target_week_start`).

5.  **Group and Aggregate Payments**:
    *   Partition the filtered payments by `v_payment_week_start`. This groups all payments by the week they occurred in.
    *   For each week (each partition group):
        *   `week`: The start date of the week (`v_payment_week_start`).
        *   `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments in that week, using `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`.
        *   `weekend_payments_received`: The sum of `v_is_weekend_int` for payments in that week, effectively counting the weekend payments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    First, we establish the time frame of interest using `Dealership.CALCULATE`. `current_w_start_dt` marks the beginning of the current week (payments must be before this date). `eight_w_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of the 8-week period, calculated as 8 weeks prior to `current_w_start_dt` (payments must be on or after this date).

2.  **Filter Sales**:
    We select `Sales` records where `sale_price` exceeds $30,000. The date boundaries calculated in the previous step are implicitly available.

3.  **Filter Payments**:
    From the filtered high-value sales, we access their associated `payment` records. These payments are then filtered to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within our 8-week window (`>= eight_w_ago_start_dt` and `< current_w_start_dt`).

4.  **Augment Payment Data**:
    Each payment within the window is further processed using `CALCULATE` to add two new fields:
    *   `payment_week_start_dt`: Determined by truncating the `payment_date` to the start of its week using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
    *   `is_weekend_day_payment`: A boolean flag, true if the `payment_date` falls on a Saturday or Sunday, checked using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.

5.  **Group and Aggregate Payments by Week**:
    The augmented payments are then partitioned by `payment_week_start_dt` using `PARTITION`. This groups all payments that occurred in the same calendar week.
    For each group (i.e., for each week):
    *   `week_as_date`: The start date of the week (taken from the partition key `payment_week_start_dt`).
    *   `total_payments_in_week`: The total number of payments in that week is counted using `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`.
    *   `weekend_payments_in_week`: The number of payments made on a weekend is calculated by summing `1` for each payment where `PaymentsReceived.is_weekend_day_payment` is true (using `SUM(IFF(..., 1, 0))`).

6.  **Order Results**:
    Finally, the summarized weekly data is ordered by `week_as_date` in ascending order, presenting the report chronologically.

This query will return a list of weeks (represented by their start date) from the last 8 full calendar weeks (excluding the current one), along with the total number of payments and the count of weekend payments for sales over $30,000 in each of those weeks.

The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29)` ensures that the sale occurred between 0 and 29 days ago (inclusive), covering a 30-day period.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: Selects sales records where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`: Ensures that the `sale_date` occurred within the last 30 days (i.e., the difference in days between the `sale_date` and `DATETIME('now')` is 0, 1, ..., up to 29). This covers today and the 29 preceding days.
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only sales meeting all criteria are included.

**Explanation:**

The query starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
-   `sp_first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
-   `sp_last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
-   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made` sub-collection).
-   `calculated_num_sales`: The count of all sales associated with the salesperson.

The second `CALCULATE` then uses these intermediate values to produce the final output:
-   `first_name`: Renamed from `sp_first_name`.
-   `last_name`: Renamed from `sp_last_name`.
-   `total_sales_amount`: Renamed from `calculated_total_sales`.
-   `number_of_sales`: Renamed from `calculated_num_sales`.
-   `SR`: The sales rank, calculated using the `RANKING()` function on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order. This means salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank number.

Finally, `ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())` sorts the resulting list of salespersons by their sales rank in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",43.98172783851624,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code determines the highest sale price for each make and model of cars that have been sold and are confirmed to be no longer in inventory based on their latest status.

1.  **Filter Relevant Cars (`cars_meeting_criteria`):**
    *   It starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters cars based on three conditions:
        *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: Ensures the car has at least one sale record, meaning it has been sold.
        *   `HAS(inventory_snapshots) == 1`: Ensures the car has inventory snapshot records, which are necessary to determine its current inventory status.
        *   The car's most recent inventory status must be 'not in inventory'. This is determined by:
            *   Accessing the car's `inventory_snapshots`.
            *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`: This selects the inventory snapshot record with the most recent `snapshot_date` for that specific car. The `per=""Cars""` ensures the ranking is done individually for each car.
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the single resulting snapshot record into an accessible context.
            *   `.is_in_inventory == False`: Checks if the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot is `False`.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then creates aliases `car_mk` for `make` and `car_mdl` for `model`. These aliases are used as keys for partitioning. The `sale_records` associated with each car are implicitly available for later aggregation.

2.  **Group by Make and Model and Calculate Highest Sale Price (`grouped_by_make_model`):**
    *   The `cars_meeting_criteria` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""make_model_group"", by=(car_mk, car_mdl))`. This groups the cars by each unique combination of make (`car_mk`) and model (`car_mdl`).
    *   For each group, a `CALCULATE` clause computes:
        *   `make=car_mk`: The make of the current group.
        *   `model=car_mdl`: The model of the current group.
        *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the maximum `sale_price` from all `sale_records` associated with the cars within the current make-model partition group. Here, `Cars` refers to the subset of cars from `cars_meeting_criteria` that belong to this specific group.

3.  **Order Results (`result`):**
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())` sorts the make-model groups in descending order based on their calculated `highest_sale_price`.
    *   The final ordered list of makes, models, and their corresponding highest sale prices is assigned to the `result` variable.",94.02375197410583,"# Step 1: Filter cars to include only those that have been sold, have inventory snapshots,

1.  **Identify Cars with Known Inventory Status**: Start with the `Cars` collection. Filter for cars that have at least one entry in `inventory_snapshots`, as this is required to determine their latest inventory status. For each of these cars, calculate its make, model, and a boolean flag (`latest_inventory_status_bool`) indicating if it's currently in inventory based on its most recent snapshot. The most recent snapshot is found by ranking snapshots by `snapshot_date` in descending order and picking the top one.
2.  **Filter for Cars No Longer in Inventory**: From the above set of cars, filter further to retain only those where `latest_inventory_status_bool` is `False`. These are the cars confirmed to be no longer in inventory.
3.  **Get Sales Details for These Cars**: For the cars identified in step 2, access their `sale_records`. This effectively gives us all sales of cars that are confirmed to be no longer in inventory. For each sale, we extract the car's make and model (propagated from the parent car context) and the `sale_price` of that specific sale.
4.  **Group by Make and Model**: The resulting collection of individual sales (each with make, model, and price) is then partitioned by make and model.
5.  **Calculate Highest Sale Price per Group**: For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` among all sales in that group.
6.  **Order and Format Output**: Finally, order these grouped results by the calculated maximum sale price in descending order. The final output will include the make, model, and the highest sale price.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Cars` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   The condition `(LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%""))` filters for cars where:
        *   The lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"" (e.g., ""Ford"", ""FORD"", ""BigFord Co""). The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches.
        *   OR, the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"" (e.g., ""Mustang"", ""MUSTANG GT"").
    *   `LOWER()` is used on `make` and `model` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each car that matches the filter criteria, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   `make=make`: Selects the car's make.
    *   `model=model`: Selects the car's model.
    *   `year=year`: Selects the car's year.
    *   `color=color`: Selects the car's color.
    *   `vin_number=vin_number`: Selects the car's VIN number.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: Calculates the average sale price for the car.
        *   `sale_records` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each car.
        *   `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)` computes the average of the `sale_price` from all sale records associated with that specific car. If a car has no sale records, this average will typically be null.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
2.  **` (LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")) `**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase make name contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards, allowing ""ford"" to appear anywhere in the make name.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase model name contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The logical OR operator, so cars matching either condition are included.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this function is used to select the desired fields and calculate the average sale price for each car that met the criteria.

    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within those sale records.

This calculation is for the last 6 months, excluding the current month. The results should include all months within this period that had any sales activity, showing 0 for PMSPS/PMSR if no sales were made by the target salespersons in such a month. The output should be ordered by month.

Here's the breakdown of the PyDough code:

1.  **Define Time Period**: We establish the start and end dates for the 6-month window.
    *   `start_date_boundary`: The first day of the month, 6 months ago.
    *   `end_date_boundary`: The first day of the current month (making the period exclusive of the current month).

2.  **Prepare Sales Data**:
    *   Filter `Sales` to include only those within the defined 6-month period.
    *   In a `CALCULATE` step, we create:
        *   `sale_year_month_str`: A string representation of the sale's year and month (e.g., ""2023-01"") for grouping.
        *   `sale_price_val`: The sale price, to be summed for PMSR.
        *   `salesperson_hire_year_val`: The year the salesperson associated with the sale was hired. This is used to filter for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023.
        *   `sale_identifier`: The ID of the sale, used for counting unique sales for PMSPS.

3.  **Partition by Month**:
    *   The prepared sales data is then partitioned by `sale_year_month_str` using `PARTITION(name=""sales_per_month_group"", by=(sale_year_month_str))`. This groups all sales by their year-month.

4.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**:
    *   For each month partition, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `month`: The year-month string.
        *   `relevant_sales_this_month`: We filter the sales within the current month's partition (`sales_per_month_group.Sales`) to include only those made by salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023 (using `salesperson_hire_year_val`).
        *   `PMSPS`: Calculated by `COUNT(relevant_sales_this_month.sale_identifier)`. If no relevant sales occurred, this will be 0.
        *   `PMSR`: Calculated by `SUM(relevant_sales_this_month.sale_price_val)`. If no relevant sales occurred, this will be 0.

5.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month` in ascending order.

This approach ensures that if a month within the 6-month window had any sales activity (even if not by the target salespersons), it will appear in the results. If the target salespersons had no sales in such a month, PMSPS and PMSR for that month will correctly be 0. Months with no sales activity at all during the period will not be generated by this partitioning approach.

2.  **Identify Relevant Months**: We first find all unique months within this time window that have any sales activity at all. This forms the basis for our report, ensuring that we consider every month in the period that has data.
3.  **Filter Salespersons**: We are interested in salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each identified month, we will:
    *   Count the number of sales (PMSPS) made by the filtered salespersons.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_val` and `end_period_val` define the date range for the last six full months, excluding the current month. For example, if ""now"" is July 15th, 2024, this range would be from January 1st, 2024, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2024.
2.  `report_months_base`:
    *   First, we take all `Sales` and calculate `sale_month_dt` by truncating `sale_date` to the start of its month.
    *   We filter these to include only sales falling within our defined 6-month window (`start_period_val` to `end_period_val`).
    *   Then, we use `PARTITION` by `sale_month_dt` and `CALCULATE month_val = sale_month_dt` to get a distinct list of months within the window that had at least one sale (from any salesperson). This forms the set of months for our report.
3.  `result`:
    *   We iterate over each `month_val` from `report_months_base`.
    *   For each `month_val`, we calculate:
        *   `month`: This is simply `month_val`, representing the month of the report row.
        *   `PMSPS`: We count records in the `Sales` collection. These sales must satisfy two conditions:
            1.  Their `sale_date` (truncated to the month) matches the current `month_val`.
            2.  The sale was made by a salesperson whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
        *   `PMSR`: We sum the `sale_price` of sales records meeting the same two conditions as for `PMSPS`.
    *   If, for a given `month_val`, no sales meet these criteria (e.g., sales in that month were not by the specified salespersons), `COUNT` will be 0 and `SUM` will effectively be 0, satisfying the requirement to include months where metrics are 0.

    )

```
Explanation:
1.  The first `CALCULATE` on the `Dealership` collection computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_2023`: It filters the `Sales` collection for records where the year of `sale_date` is 2023. Then, it sums the `sale_price` of these filtered sales.
    *   `total_cost_2023`: Similarly, it filters `Sales` for 2023 and then accesses the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale using `Sales.car.cost`. It then sums these costs.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` takes these two aggregated values (`total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`) and computes the `gpm_2023`.
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `total_cost_2023` is not zero.
    *   If `total_cost_2023` is not zero, it calculates GPM using the formula `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures a floating-point result for the percentage.
    *   If `total_cost_2023` is zero (to prevent division by zero), it assigns `0.0` to `gpm_2023`. This value might be adjusted based on specific business requirements for handling undefined GPM.
The final result `gpm_calculation_2023` will be a collection with a single row and a single column `gpm_2023` representing the Gross Profit Margin for all car sales in 2023.",26.25860452651977,"gpm_calculation_2023 = Dealership.CALCULATE(

    gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across multiple sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For each of these sales, it accesses the `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all filtered sales to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale, it navigates to the associated `Car` record (via `Sales.car`) and then accesses its `cost`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used because the GPM calculation depends on `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`, which were defined in the first `CALCULATE`.
5.  `gpm_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100`: This line implements the GPM formula using the previously calculated totals. The result is assigned to `gpm_2023`.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as we are interested in sale prices and sale dates.
2.  For each sale, we need information about the car (make, model) and the sale itself (price, date). We use `CALCULATE` to make these fields available. Let's call the calculated sale date `the_sale_date` and sale price `the_price` to distinguish them.
3.  Filter these sales records. A sale is eligible if the car involved was marked as out of inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) on the *exact same day* as the sale (`snapshot_date == the_sale_date`).
    *   We access the car associated with the current sale using `Sales.car`.
    *   Then, we access its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection.
    *   We use a `WHERE` clause on these snapshots to find any that match `is_in_inventory == False` and `snapshot_date == the_sale_date` (where `the_sale_date` is the sale date of the current `Sales` record).
    *   The `HAS(...) == 1` function checks if at least one such inventory snapshot exists for the car on its sale date.
4.  From the filtered list of eligible sales, we use `TOP_K(1, by=the_price.DESC())` to find the single sale record that has the highest sale price.
5.  Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: `make`, `model`, and `sale_price`.

```python
result = Sales.CALCULATE(
    the_make = car.make,
    the_model = car.model,
    the_price = sale_price,
    the_sale_date = sale_date  # Calculate sale_date to be used in the sub-filter

).CALCULATE(
    make = the_make,
    model = the_model,
    sale_price = the_price
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each record in the `Sales` collection. For each sale, it retrieves the `make` and `model` of the associated car (`car.make`, `car.model`), the `sale_price`, and the `sale_date`. These are assigned to temporary variables `the_make`, `the_model`, `the_price`, and `the_sale_date`.
2.  `.WHERE(HAS(Sales.car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1)`: This filters the sales records. A sale is kept if:

    *   `.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == the_sale_date))`: It filters these snapshots to find any where the car was marked as not in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) and the `snapshot_date` matches `the_sale_date` (the date the car was sold).
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This condition is true if at least one such inventory snapshot exists, meaning the car went out of inventory on the same day it was sold.
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=the_price.DESC())`: From the sales that meet the criteria, this selects the single sale record with the highest `the_price`. If there are ties for the highest price, one will be chosen.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to find sales where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `car` associated with each sale.
    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

```python
# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory
sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(

result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(
    make=car.make,
    model=car.model,
    sale_price=sale_price
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:
        *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.
        *   `model=car.model`: Retrieves the `model` of the car.
        *   `sale_price=sale_price`: Retrieves the `sale_price` from the sale record.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `payment_time_info`: We start by taking the `PaymentsReceived` collection and adding two new calculated fields: `pay_year` (the year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (the month of `payment_date`).
2.  `monthly_payment_summary`: This step takes `payment_time_info` and partitions it by `pay_year` and `pay_month`. For each unique year-month combination, it calculates:
    *   `actual_year`: The year of the group.
    *   `actual_month`: The month of the group.
    *   `total_payments_for_month`: The sum of all `payment_amount` values within that year-month group. This uses `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)` to aggregate from the original `PaymentsReceived` data that falls into the current partition group.
3.  `final_monthly_report`: This final step takes the `monthly_payment_summary` (which contains one row per year/month with total payments) and calculates the Month-over-Month change:
    *   `year_val`, `month_val`, `total_monthly_payments`: These fields are carried over from the previous step for the final output.
    *   `mom_change`: This is calculated as the `total_payments_for_month` of the current row minus the `total_payments_for_month` of the previous row. The `PREV` function is used to get this previous value.
        *   `by=(actual_year.ASC(), actual_month.ASC())`: This tells `PREV` to consider rows in ascending order of year, then month, to correctly identify the ""previous"" month.
        *   `default=0.0`: If there is no previous month (e.g., for the earliest month in the data), `PREV` will return `0.0`, so the MoM change for the first month will effectively be its total payments.",55.36570811271668,"# Step 1: Extract year and month from payment_date

3.  `Dealership.Sales.WHERE(...)`: This accesses the `Sales` sub-collection of `Dealership` and applies a filter to it.
4.  `(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6)`: This is the filtering condition applied to each sale:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')`: Calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment (`'now'`).
    *   `>= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future (i.e., today or in the past).
    *   `<= 6`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is within the last 6 days from today (inclusive of today, making it a 7-day window).

1.  Filter out salespersons who have not made any sales, as ASP cannot be calculated for them.
2.  For each remaining salesperson, calculate their total sales amount (sum of `sale_price` from their sales) and the number of sales they made (count of their sales).
3.  Calculate their ASP using the formula: `ASP = total sales amount / number of sales`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have at least one sale record in `sales_made`. This is crucial to avoid division by zero when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name, asp_value=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))`:
    *   For each salesperson who has made sales, we calculate three new fields:
        *   `s_first_name`: The salesperson's first name (aliased to avoid potential conflicts).
        *   `s_last_name`: The salesperson's last name (aliased).
        *   `asp_value`: The Average Selling Price, calculated as the total sum of `sale_price` from all their `sales_made` divided by the total `COUNT` of their `sales_made`.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=asp_value.DESC())`: This selects the top 3 salespersons based on their `asp_value` in descending order (highest ASP first).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only salespersons who have at least one sale record in their `sales_made` sub-collection. The `HAS(sales_made) == 1` condition ensures that `COUNT(sales_made)` will be greater than zero, preventing division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this `CALCULATE` function computes new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Stores the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Stores the salesperson's last name.
    *   `calculated_asp=SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)`: Calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP). `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` aggregates the total sales amount from all sales made by the salesperson, and `COUNT(sales_made)` counts the total number of sales.
3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=calculated_asp.DESC())`: This function takes the result from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 3 salespersons. The ranking is based on the `calculated_asp` field, in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the highest ASP are ranked first.
4.  `.CALCULATE(first_name=sp_first_name, last_name=sp_last_name, ASP=calculated_asp)`: This final `CALCULATE` function formats the output for the top 3 salespersons, selecting their first name, last name, and their calculated ASP, renaming them to the requested output field names.",25.23335862159729,"top_3_salespersons_by_asp = Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start by accessing the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    *   `sale_records` is the sub-collection within `Cars` that lists all sales associated with a particular car.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection is empty for each car.
    *   `== 1` (or simply `HASNOT(sale_records)`) ensures we only keep cars for which this condition is true (i.e., they have no sales records).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**: This selects and renames the desired fields for the cars that met the filter criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Sales.PARTITION(name=""sales_by_customer"", by=(customer_id))`**:
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection, which contains records of all sales.
    *   The `PARTITION` method is used to group the sales records.
    *   `by=(customer_id)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `customer_id` field within each sale record. This creates groups where each group contains all sales made by a single, unique customer.
    *   `name=""sales_by_customer""` assigns a temporary name to these groups, though it's not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` in this specific query structure for distinct values.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)`**:
    *   After partitioning, `CALCULATE` is applied to each group (each unique customer).
    *   `customer_id=customer_id` selects the `customer_id` that defines the current group. Since each group corresponds to a unique `customer_id`, this effectively produces a collection where each record contains one distinct `customer_id` of a customer who has made at least one purchase.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made) == 1)`**: This filters the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sales_made` is the sub-collection linking salespersons to their sales records.
    *   `HASNOT(sales_made)` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection is empty for each salesperson.
    *   `== 1` ensures we select only those salespersons for whom `HASNOT(sales_made)` is true (i.e., they have no sales). This is conceptually similar to a left join where the right side (sales) is null.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function selects and renames the fields to be returned.
    *   `salesperson_id=_id`: Selects the `_id` field and renames it to `salesperson_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each salesperson.
    *   `s_first_name=first_name`, `s_last_name=last_name`: We select the first and last names, renaming them temporarily to avoid conflicts in subsequent calculations if needed (though not strictly necessary here, it's good practice).
    *   `sales_count_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30))`: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` (a list of their sales). We filter these sales to include only those made in the ""past 30 days"". The condition `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30` checks if the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp is less than 30 (covering a 30-day period ending today). `COUNT` then counts these filtered sales.
    *   `total_revenue_last_30_days=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30).sale_price)`: Similarly, we filter the sales for the last 30 days and then sum their `sale_price` to get the total revenue for that salesperson in that period.

2.  `.WHERE(sales_count_last_30_days > 0)`: This filters the results to include only those salespersons who made at least one sale in the last 30 days.

3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=sales_count_last_30_days.DESC())`: From the filtered list of salespersons, this selects the top 5 based on the `sales_count_last_30_days`, in descending order.

4.  `result = top_salespersons_by_sales_count.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects the desired output fields:

Explanation:
The PyDough code performs the following operations:
1.  `sales_with_state_info = Sales.CALCULATE(customer_state_key=customer.state)`: This line starts with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, it extracts the state of the customer (`customer.state`) and assigns it to a new field `customer_state_key`. This new field will be used for grouping.

        *   `number_of_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer._id)`: It calculates the count of distinct customers who made purchases within that state. `Sales.customer._id` refers to the customer ID from the original `Sales` records belonging to the current state partition.
        *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that state. `Sales.sale_price` refers to the sale price from the original `Sales` records belonging to the current state partition.
3.  `top_states_by_revenue = state_level_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This line takes the `state_level_summary` (which contains data for all states) and selects the top 5 states, ordered by `total_revenue` in descending order.

2.  Group the customers by `state` using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each state group, calculate:

    *   `num_unique_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers within the current state partition. Since customers are grouped by state, this effectively gives the number of unique customers for that state.
    *   `total_revenue_for_state=SUM(Customers.car_purchases.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for the current state. It accesses the `car_purchases` (list of sales) for all `Customers` within the state partition and sums their `sale_price`.

1.  **Partition by Payment Method**: We'll start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection and group the records by the `payment_method` field. This is done using the `PARTITION` function.
2.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each payment method group, we'll calculate:
    *   The `payment_method` itself (which is the partition key).
    *   The `total_number_of_payments` using `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`, which counts the number of payment records within that group.
    *   The `total_amount` received using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`, which sums up the payment amounts for that group.
3.  **Select Top 3**: After calculating these aggregates, we'll use `TOP_K(3, by=total_amount.DESC())` to select the top 3 payment methods based on the `total_amount` in descending order.

The resulting records will contain the `payment_method`, `total_number_of_payments`, and `total_amount` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_car_keys = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved in the sale using `car.make` and `car.model`. These are stored as `car_make_key` and `car_model_key` respectively, which will be used for grouping. The original `sale_price` from each sale record is implicitly carried forward.

2.  `model_performance_metrics = sales_with_car_keys.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the records from `sales_with_car_keys` based on unique combinations of `car_make_key` and `car_model_key`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(make = car_make_key, model = car_model_key, ...)`: For each group (each unique make and model):
        *   `make = car_make_key` and `model = car_model_key`: These lines select the make and model for the output.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records belonging to the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that model.
        *   `total_sales = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records in the current make/model group, giving the total number of units sold for that model.

3.  `top_models_by_revenue = model_performance_metrics.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This takes the aggregated data for all car models and selects the top 5 based on the `total_revenue`, sorted in descending order.

    *   `total_revenue_generated=SUM(...)`: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` (a list of their sales). We filter these sales to include only those where `sale_date` falls within our defined `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`. Then, we sum the `sale_price` of these filtered sales to get the total revenue for that salesperson in the period.

    num_payments=COUNT(PaymentsMade)

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `PaymentsMade` collection and then apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters the payments to include only those where the `vendor_name` is 'Utility Company'.
3.  **`& (ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday')))`**:
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)`: This function extracts the name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: This function checks if the extracted day name is either 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.
    *   The `&` operator combines this condition with the vendor name condition, so only payments meeting both criteria are selected.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(num_payments=COUNT(PaymentsMade))`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to count the number of resulting payment records. The `COUNT(PaymentsMade)` function counts the records in the filtered collection, and we assign this count to a new field called `num_payments`.

    *   The ""previous ISO week"" refers to the full week (Monday-Sunday) immediately preceding the current week.

2.  **Filter `PaymentsReceived`**: Select payments that fall within this calculated date range.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: Extract the actual day (ignoring time component) from `payment_date` and the `payment_method` for each relevant payment.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start by defining two key date boundaries at the `Dealership` (top) level.
    *   `start_of_current_iso_week`: Calculates the timestamp for Monday 00:00:00 of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_previous_iso_week`: Calculates the timestamp for Monday 00:00:00 of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.

2.  `payments_for_partitioning = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_of_previous_iso_week) & (payment_date < start_of_current_iso_week))`: This filters the payments to include only those that occurred during the previous ISO week. The range is inclusive of the `start_of_previous_iso_week` and exclusive of the `start_of_current_iso_week`, effectively covering Monday to Sunday of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(day_of_payment = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day'), p_method = payment_method)`:
        *   `day_of_payment`: For each filtered payment, this extracts just the date part (setting time to 00:00:00) from the `payment_date`. This is crucial for grouping payments by day, regardless of the time they occurred.
        *   `p_method`: Selects the `payment_method` field. These two calculated fields (`day_of_payment`, `p_method`) will be used as keys for partitioning.

3.  `daily_payments_by_method = payments_for_partitioning.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_groups"", by=(day_of_payment, p_method))`: This groups the records from `payments_for_partitioning` based on unique combinations of `day_of_payment` and `p_method`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `payment_day_output = day_of_payment`:  Outputs the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_output = p_method`: Outputs the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_received = SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all `PaymentsReceived` records that fall into the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(payment_day_output.ASC(), payment_method_output.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the payment day and then by the payment method for easier reading.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
    *   We'll calculate the start date (Monday) and end date (Sunday) of the week immediately preceding the current week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week.
    *   Subtracting 7 days from this gives the Monday of the previous week.
    *   Subtracting 1 day from the Monday of the current week gives the Sunday of the previous week.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated previous week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   Extract the calendar day from `payment_date` (by truncating it to the start of the day) to ensure daily aggregation.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for further processing.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered and prepared payments by the extracted calendar day and `payment_method`.
    *   For each group (each day and payment method combination), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.

5.  **Select and Order Results**:
    *   The final output will include the transaction date (day), the payment method, and the total amount for that combination.
    *   The results will be ordered by date and then by payment method for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.
        *   `payment_amount_from_data = payment_amount`: Aliases `payment_amount` for clarity.

3.  `result = payments_for_grouping.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_extracted, payment_method_from_data))`: This groups the `payments_for_grouping` data. Each group will consist of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_extracted` and have the same `payment_method_from_data`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `transaction_date = payment_day_extracted`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_type = payment_method_from_data`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_by_method = SUM(payments_for_grouping.payment_amount_from_data)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount_from_data` for all payments within the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(transaction_date.ASC(), payment_method_type.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the transaction date in ascending order, and then by payment method type, also in ascending order. This makes the output easy to read.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  For each of these sales, calculate two new attributes:
    *   `c_state`: The state of the customer who made the purchase, accessed via `customer.state`.
    *   `quarter_start_dt`: A string representing the first date of the quarter in which the sale occurred. This is determined using the month of the `sale_date`. For example, sales in January, February, or March will have `quarter_start_dt` as ""2023-01-01"".
3.  Partition these processed sales records by `c_state` and `quarter_start_dt`. This groups all sales by the customer's state and the specific quarter of 2023.
4.  For each group (i.e., for each state and quarter), calculate the sum of `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records within that group. This gives the total sales for that state in that quarter.

    *   `quarter_start_dt=IFF(...)`: This expression determines the first day of the quarter for each sale. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the `sale_date`:
        *   If the month is 1, 2, or 3, `quarter_start_dt` is ""2023-01-01"" (Q1).
        *   If the month is 4, 5, or 6, `quarter_start_dt` is ""2023-04-01"" (Q2).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, two new fields are derived for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: This extracts the `state` from the `customer` associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
        *   `q_start_date`: This determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the sale:
            *   Months 1, 2, 3 (Q1) map to ""2023-01-01"".
            *   Months 4, 5, 6 (Q2) map to ""2023-04-01"".
            *   Months 7, 8, 9 (Q3) map to ""2023-07-01"".
            *   Months 10, 11, 12 (Q4) map to ""2023-10-01"".
    *   The `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records is implicitly available for aggregation in the next step.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`result`):**
    *   The `sales_data_for_partition` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""quarterly_sales_groups"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   After partitioning, another `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_start_date = q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_sales = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific customer state and quarter. The `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records belonging to each partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation for each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
2.  `drug_name=drug_name`: This selects the name of the drug.
3.  `avg_ddd=AVG(...)`: This calculates the average DDD for the current drug. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
4.  `treatments_used_in`: This accesses the list of treatments associated with the current drug.
5.  `.WHERE((HAS(end_dt) == 1) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0))`: This filters the treatments:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: Ensures that the treatment has an end date, as specified by ""where end date is not null"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Calculates the duration of the treatment in days and ensures it's positive. This prevents division by zero or non-positive values when calculating DDD.
6.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the filter, this inner `CALCULATE` computes its individual DDD.
    *   `tot_drug_amt` is the total drug amount consumed for that specific treatment.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` is the duration of that treatment in days.
7.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This part extracts the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values from the collection of filtered and calculated treatments. This list of DDD values is then passed to the `AVG` function.
8.  The `AVG` function then computes the average of these individual DDDs for the drug. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria (e.g., all treatments have null end dates or non-positive durations), the `avg_ddd` will be `None`.",37.49722504615784,"avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(

```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code starts by iterating through each record in the `Drugs` collection.

For each drug:
-   It selects the `drug_name`.
-   It calculates `avg_ddd_value` using the `AVG` aggregation function. The input to `AVG` is a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`).
-   The process to get these individual DDD values is as follows:
    1.  `treatments_used_in.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments to only include those where `end_dt` is present (not null).
    2.  `.CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For these filtered treatments, it calculates the duration in days between `start_dt` and `end_dt`.
    3.  `.WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`: It further filters the treatments to ensure the calculated `treatment_duration_days` is positive, preventing division by zero and ensuring meaningful DDDs.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment=tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days)`: For treatments that pass both filters, it calculates the DDD using the formula `tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    5.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values, forming a collection of numbers that `AVG` can then average.

The final output `drug_avg_ddd` will contain each drug's name and its corresponding average DDD. If a drug has no valid treatments to calculate DDD (e.g., all treatments have null `end_dt` or zero/negative duration), its `avg_ddd_value` will typically be null.",41.74776887893677,"drug_avg_ddd = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Define Dynamic Date Ranges**: First, we establish the date ranges for the three relevant months:
    *   One month ago (e.g., if ""now"" is July, this is June).
    *   Two months ago (e.g., May).
    *   Three months ago (e.g., April).
    We also create string labels for these months in ""YYYY-MM"" format. These definitions are made at a global level using `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` so they can be referenced downstream.

2.  **Augment and Filter Treatments**:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection.
    *   For each treatment, we determine which of the three defined monthly periods its `start_dt` falls into. A `period_label` (YYYY-MM string) is assigned if it matches one of the target months; otherwise, it's marked for exclusion.
    *   We also extract the `patient_id` (as `p_id`) and a boolean flag `is_biologic` indicating if the treatment used a drug of type 'biologic'.
    *   Treatments not falling into any of the three target months are filtered out.

3.  **Partition by Month**: The augmented and filtered treatments are then partitioned by the `period_label`. This creates groups of treatments for each of the three months.

4.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `month`: The ""YYYY-MM"" label for the month.
    *   `patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct patient IDs (`NDISTINCT(p_id)`) among all treatments in that month's group. This gives the total number of unique patients treated in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct patient IDs for treatments that were flagged as `is_biologic`. This is done using `NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(p_id, is_biologic == True))`, which considers only patient IDs from biologic treatments for the distinct count.

5.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by month in descending order (most recent of the three months first).

2.  **Filter Treatments**: Select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this three-month period.
3.  **Enhance Treatment Data**: For each selected treatment, determine:
    *   The year and month of the treatment (`treatment_month_year_str`) for grouping.
    *   A flag (`is_biologic_treatment`) indicating if the treatment used a biologic drug (where `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`).
4.  **Group by Month**: Partition the enhanced treatment data by `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each month's partition:
    *   Count the total number of distinct patients (`distinct_patient_count`).
    *   Count the number of distinct patients who received at least one biologic treatment in that month (`biologic_treatment_patient_count`). This uses `KEEP_IF` to consider only patients associated with biologic treatments for the distinct count.

3.  For these treatments, it calculates a `treatment_month_year_str` (e.g., ""2023-07"") and an `is_biologic_treatment` flag.
4.  It then partitions these processed treatments by `treatment_month_year_str`.

    *   The start of the window (inclusive) is 6 months prior to the start of the current month. This can be calculated using `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-6 months')`.

2.  **Filter Treatments by Date**: Select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Filter Treatments by Patient Name**: From the date-filtered treatments, select those associated with a patient whose first name is ""Alice"". We'll assume ""Alice"" refers to the first name.

    *   `start_date_inclusive = DATETIME(end_date_exclusive, '-6 months')` sets the lower bound to six months before the start of the current month.
2.  It filters the `Treatments` collection to get `treatments_in_period` which includes all treatments whose `start_dt` is on or after `start_date_inclusive` and before `end_date_exclusive`.
3.  It then filters `treatments_in_period` to get `alice_treatments_in_period` by checking if the associated `patient.first_name` is ""Alice"".

2.  **Group Doctors by Specialty**: Partition the doctors based on their `speciality`. This will create groups of doctors, where each group belongs to the same specialty.
3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_drug_data = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`: This line processes the `Doctors` collection. For each doctor, it selects their `doc_id` (renamed to `doc_id_val`), `speciality` (renamed to `speciality_val`), and calculates `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` by counting the distinct drug IDs found in their `prescribed_treatments`.
2.  `doctors_partitioned_by_specialty = doctors_drug_data.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `doctors_drug_data` and groups the doctors by their `speciality_val`. The `name=""doctors_in_specialty_group""` means that for each specialty, there will be a sub-collection named `doctors_in_specialty_group` containing all doctors belonging to that specialty.
3.  `result = doctors_partitioned_by_specialty.doctors_in_specialty_group.CALCULATE(...)`: This line iterates through each `doctors_in_specialty_group` (i.e., for each specialty, it processes its doctors).

    *   It selects `num_distinct_drugs_prescribed` as `number_of_distinct_drugs_prescribed`.
    *   It calculates `SDRSDR` using the `RANKING` function. `by=num_distinct_drugs_prescribed.DESC()` means doctors who prescribed more distinct drugs get a lower rank number (e.g., rank 1 is the highest). `per=""doctors_in_specialty_group""` ensures this ranking is done independently within each specialty group.",89.23303580284119,"# Step 1: Calculate the number of distinct drugs prescribed by each doctor, along with their ID and specialty.

1.  **Calculate Metrics per Doctor**: For each doctor, we first calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed.

This result is stored in an intermediate collection `doctor_metrics`.

2.  **Partition Doctors by Specialty**: We then partition the `doctor_metrics` collection by the `speciality` field. This groups doctors based on their specialty. Each group (partition) is named `specialty_group`.

3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**: For each `specialty_group` (i.e., for each specialty), we access the `Doctors` records belonging to that group. For these doctors, we then:
    *   Select the required fields: `doc_id` and `speciality`.
    *   Use the previously calculated count of distinct drugs, renaming it to `number_of_distinct_drugs` for the final output.
    *   Calculate `SDRSDR` (Specialty Drug Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `by` the number of distinct drugs in descending order (so more drugs mean a better/lower rank number, e.g., rank 1) and `per=""specialty_group""` ensures the rank is calculated independently within each specialty.

This approach ensures that each doctor's rank is relative to other doctors within the same specialty.

This involves defining a time window, filtering treatments, grouping them by month, and then performing the respective counts.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Time Boundaries**:
    *   It first calculates two key dates using the `DermTreatment` (top-level) collection:
        *   `twelve_months_ago_start_date`: The start of the month that was 12 months prior to the current month's start. This marks the beginning of our 12-month analysis window.
        *   `current_month_start_date`: The start of the current month. Treatments included in the analysis must have a `start_dt` *before* this date.
    *   This setup ensures we are looking at the 12 full months preceding the current month.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatments**:
    *   It accesses the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the defined 12-month window (`>= twelve_months_ago_start_date` and `< current_month_start_date`).
    *   `CALCULATE` then extracts the year (`treatment_year_val`) and month (`treatment_month_val`) from the `start_dt` of these filtered treatments. These values will be used for grouping. The `patient_id` field from the `Treatments` collection is implicitly carried forward.

3.  **Partition by Month and Calculate Metrics**:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(treatment_year_val, treatment_month_val))` groups the prepared treatments by unique year-month combinations.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `year_month_str`: A formatted string representing the year and month (e.g., ""2023-06"") using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `pmpd_count`: This is PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses). It's calculated as `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`. This counts the number of unique patients who received at least one treatment (and thus an associated diagnosis) within that specific month.
        *   `pmtc_count`: This is PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count). It's calculated as `COUNT(Treatments)`, which counts the total number of treatments that occurred in that specific month.
    *   `ORDER_BY(treatment_year_val.ASC(), treatment_month_val.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically.

4.  **Final Output Selection**:
    *   The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `year_month`, `PMPD`, and `PMTC`.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first determine the relevant 12-month period. This period starts from the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current month and ends on the last day of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is July 15, 2024, the window will span from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each selected treatment, we extract the year and month from its `start_dt`. These will serve as keys for grouping. This step effectively truncates the `start_dt` to the month level as requested.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the filtered and prepared treatments by year and month. This creates distinct groups, each representing one month within our 12-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each monthly group, we count the number of unique `patient_id` values associated with the treatments in that month. This represents the number of distinct patients who received a diagnosis (as implied by a treatment record) during that month.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each monthly group, we count the total number of treatment records. This gives the total treatments administered in that month.
6.  **Format and Order**: We format the year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for clear presentation and order the results chronologically.

The final output will list each of the last 12 months along with its corresponding PMPD and PMTC values.

    *   The data from step 1 (each patient and their first treatment year) is then partitioned by `year_of_first_treatment`.
    *   For each year in the partition, we count the number of unique patients (`p_id`) whose first treatment occurred in that year. This gives us `num_new_patients` for each year.
    *   The results are ordered by year to facilitate the next step.

3.  **Calculate NPI (New Patients Increase)**:
    *   For each year's count of new patients, we use the `PREV` window function to access the `num_new_patients` from the immediately preceding year.
    *   The NPI is calculated as: `current_year_num_new_patients - previous_year_num_new_patients`.
    *   For the earliest year in the dataset, there is no previous year, so the NPI will be `None` (null).

The final result will list each year, the number of new patients for that year, and the calculated NPI.

1.  **Identify Each Patient's First Treatment**: For each patient, find all treatments they've received (`Patients.treatments_received`). Then, rank these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The treatment with rank 1 is the patient's first-ever treatment.
2.  **Filter for First Treatments**: Keep only those treatments that are identified as a patient's first treatment. Each record at this stage represents a patient becoming ""new"" to the system.
3.  **Determine Year of First Treatment**: For each of these first treatments, extract the year from its `start_dt`. This is the year the patient became a ""new patient"".
4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function is used here. For the earliest year in the data, NPI will be `None` as there's no preceding year for comparison.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year. If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the data), `PREV` returns `None`, making the `npi` also `None`.",86.58913064002991,"# Step 1: Access treatments for each patient and rank them by start date

The calculation must only include outcomes where PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100 are non-null.

Here's the step-by-step derivation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Filter Valid Outcomes**: We first create a subset of `Outcomes` that only includes records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (non-null). We use `HASNOT(field_name) == 0` to check for non-null fields, as `HASNOT(field_name) == 1` indicates a field is null or absent.
2.  **Calculate Average Scores**: Using the filtered outcomes, we calculate the overall average of `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score`. This is done at the `DermTreatment` graph level to get global averages.
3.  **Apply D7D100PIR Formula**: We then apply the D7D100PIR formula using these calculated averages.
    *   To prevent division by zero if `avg_d7_score` is 0, we use the `IFF` function to return `None` in such cases.
    *   We multiply by `100.0` to ensure the result is a percentage and to maintain floating-point precision.
4.  **Return the Value**: The final result will be a single record in the `DermTreatment` context containing the calculated percentage value.

```python
# Step 1: Filter outcomes to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.
# HASNOT(field_name) == 0 checks if the field is present (not null).
valid_outcomes_for_pasi = Outcomes.WHERE(
    (HASNOT(day7_pasi_score) == 0) & (HASNOT(day100_pasi_score) == 0)
)

# Step 2 & 3: Calculate overall D7D100PIR using the formula.
# The calculation is performed at the DermTreatment graph level.
overall_d7d100pir_calculation = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate the average PASI score on day 7 from valid outcomes

        (avg_d100_score - avg_d7_score) / avg_d7_score * 100.0
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`: This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. It keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (not null). The condition `(HASNOT(day7_pasi_score) == 0) & (HASNOT(day100_pasi_score) == 0)` achieves this, as `HASNOT(field) == 0` implies the field is not absent.
2.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the highest level of the graph (`DermTreatment`).
    *   `avg_d7_score = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
    *   `avg_d100_score = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step.
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = IFF(...)`: This computes the D7D100PIR.
        *   `IFF(avg_d7_score == 0, None, ...)`: This checks if `avg_d7_score` is zero. If it is, `None` (null) is returned to avoid division by zero errors.
        *   `(avg_d100_score - avg_d7_score) / avg_d7_score * 100.0`: If `avg_d7_score` is not zero, this part of the formula is executed. It calculates the improvement rate and multiplies by `100.0` to express it as a percentage and ensure floating-point arithmetic.

We then need to return the top 5 insurance types, sorted by the lowest average PASI score.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Filter Treatments**: We start by selecting only those treatments that ended in the year 2022. We also need the patient's insurance type for each of these treatments, as this will be our partitioning key.
2.  **Partition by Insurance Type**: We then group these filtered treatments by the `ins_type_for_partition` (derived from `patient.ins_type`).
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each insurance type group:
    *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: We calculate the average of `day100_pasi_score`. This score comes from the `outcome_records` associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group. The `AVG` function will consider all `day100_pasi_score` values from all outcome records of all relevant treatments within that group.
    *   `num_distinct_patients`: We count the number of unique patients associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`.
4.  **Sort and Select Top 5**: Finally, we sort these results by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (lowest first). We use `na_pos='last'` to ensure that any insurance types for which an average PASI score could not be calculated (resulting in a null) are placed at the end of the sort. We then select the top 5 records.

The resulting PyDough code is:

```python
# Step 1: Filter treatments that ended in 2022 and get the patient's insurance type for partitioning.
treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type = Treatments.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022).CALCULATE(
    ins_type_for_partition = patient.ins_type
)

# Step 2: Partition by insurance type. For each group, calculate the average day 100 PASI score
# and the number of distinct patients.
# - 'Treatments' inside AVG and NDISTINCT refers to the subset of treatments belonging to the current partition group.
# - 'Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score' accesses PASI scores from outcomes of these treatments.
# - 'Treatments.patient.patient_id' accesses patient IDs linked to these treatments.

    avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score),
    num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)
)

# Step 3: Select the top 5 insurance types, sorted by the lowest average PASI score.
# 'na_pos='last'' ensures that groups with no PASI scores (null average) are sorted to the end.
result = analysis_by_ins_type.TOP_K(
    5, by=avg_pasi_score_d100.ASC(na_pos='last')
)
```
This code will:

It also requires the count of distinct patients for each of these insurance types.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)`.
    *   For these filtered treatments, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve the patient's insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) and the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`). These are stored as `ins_type_val` and `patient_id_val` respectively. The `day100_pasi_score` will be accessed later from the `outcome_records`.

2.  **Group by Insurance Type**:
    *   The prepared treatment data (`treatments_info`) is then partitioned by `ins_type_val` using `PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(ins_type_val))`. This groups all treatments belonging to the same insurance type.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates per Insurance Type**:
    *   For each insurance group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `insurance_type_name`: The name of the insurance type (from `ins_type_val`).
        *   `avg_day100_pasi`: The average `day100_pasi_score`. This is calculated by `AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`, which averages all `day100_pasi_score` values from all `outcome_records` associated with the treatments in the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients`: The number of distinct patients. This is calculated by `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_val)`, counting the unique `patient_id_val` values within the current insurance type group.

4.  **Select Top 5 Insurance Types**:
    *   The resulting summary (`insurance_summary`) is then processed by `TOP_K(5, by=avg_day100_pasi.ASC())`. This selects the top 5 insurance types, sorting them in ascending order based on their `avg_day100_pasi` (lowest average PASI score first).

The final result will contain the insurance type, its average day 100 PASI score, and the count of distinct patients for these top 5 insurance types.

The approach is as follows:
1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  For each diagnosis, calculate:
    *   The diagnosis name (`diag_name`).
    *   The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score from its associated treatments and their outcome records. This is achieved using `MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`.
    *   The number of distinct patients treated for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`.
3.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The primary sorting criterion will be the maximum itch score in descending order. Diagnoses for which this score is not available (null) will be ranked last.
4.  Finally, select and rename the fields as requested: `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score`.

```python
result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate intermediate fields for each diagnosis
    diagnosis_name_val=diag_name,
    max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas),

    maximum_itch_score=max_itch_score_val
)
```
Explanation:
- The query starts by accessing the `Diagnoses` collection.
- In the first `CALCULATE` step, we compute three values for each diagnosis:
    - `diagnosis_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis, taken directly from the `diag_name` field.
    - `max_itch_score_val`: The highest `day100_itch_vas` score recorded across all outcome records associated with treatments for that particular diagnosis. This is found by navigating `treatments_for` (plural relationship to `Treatments`), then `outcome_records` (plural relationship from `Treatments` to `Outcomes`), and applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `day100_itch_vas` field.
    - `num_distinct_patients_val`: The count of unique patients who have received treatment for the diagnosis. This is determined by navigating `treatments_for`, then to the linked `patient` (singular relationship from `Treatments` to `Patients`), and using `NDISTINCT` on their `patient_id`.
- The `TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))` function then filters these results to keep only the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking is based on `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). The `na_pos='last'` argument ensures that any diagnoses without a `day100_itch_vas` score (resulting in a null `max_itch_score_val`) are placed at the end of the ranking and are less likely to be included in the top 3.
- Finally, the second `CALCULATE` step selects these three computed values and renames them to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested for the output.",49.61732864379883,"result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(

This analysis is restricted to treatments that commenced within the last six calendar months. The final output should list the specialty, the total number of treatments administered by that specialty within the period, and the corresponding total drug amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is augmented using `CALCULATE` to include:
        *   `treatment_start_dt_calc`: The start date of the treatment, derived from the `start_dt` field.
        *   `doc_specialty_calc`: The specialty of the doctor who prescribed the treatment, accessed via `doctor.speciality`.
    *   Original fields like `tot_drug_amt` remain accessible.

2.  **Filter by Date**:
    *   The augmented treatment data is filtered using `WHERE` to include only treatments where `treatment_start_dt_calc` is on or after the start of the calendar month that was five months prior to the current month's start. This effectively covers the ""past 6 calendar months"" (e.g., if 'now' is July, this includes treatments from February 1st onwards).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-5 months')` calculates this boundary date.

3.  **Group by Specialty and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered `recent_treatments_info` collection is then partitioned by `doc_specialty_calc` using `PARTITION(name=""docs_by_specialty"", by=(doc_specialty_calc))`.
    *   Within each specialty group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The doctor's specialty (from `doc_specialty_calc`).
        *   `number_of_treatments`: The count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered period, obtained using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments by that specialty in the filtered period, obtained using `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`.

4.  **Select Top 3 Specialties**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_summary` to retrieve the top 3 specialties ranked by `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount for the top 3 specialties.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code addresses the request by performing the following steps:

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   It starts with the `Drugs` collection.
    *   For each drug, it calculates three new fields:
        *   `d_name`: Stores the `drug_name`.
        *   `n_treatments`: Counts the number of treatments associated with the drug using `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`. The `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection linking drugs to their treatments.
        *   `avg_d_amount`: Calculates the average total drug amount for all treatments associated with the drug using `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`. `tot_drug_amt` is a field in the `Treatments` collection. If a drug has no treatments, `COUNT` will be 0 and `AVG` will likely result in `NULL` (or be handled gracefully by the aggregation).

2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=n_treatments.DESC())`**:
    *   This function selects the top 5 drugs.
    *   The ranking is determined by the `n_treatments` field in descending order (`DESC()`), meaning drugs with the highest number of treatments will be ranked higher. The phrase ""by number of treatments and average drug amount"" is interpreted as primarily ranking by the number of treatments, as `TOP_K`'s `by` parameter typically takes a single primary sorting expression.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Finally, this selects and renames the fields for the output, as requested:
        *   `drug_name`: From the calculated `d_name`.
        *   `number_of_treatments`: From the calculated `n_treatments`.
        *   `average_drug_amount`: From the calculated `avg_d_amount`.

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three conditions:
    *   The associated diagnosis name must contain 'psoriasis'. We will use `LOWER()` and `CONTAINS()` for a case-insensitive substring match.
    *   The drug used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. We check this by ensuring the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field for the drug exists (is not null) using `HAS()`.
    *   The treatment's `end_dt` must be within the last 6 months from the current date. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago and less than or equal to the current date. We use the `DATETIME()` function to achieve this.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be calculated at the `DermTreatment` graph level to provide a single total.

**Explanation:**

*   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to calculate a single aggregate value.
*   `number_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(...)`: This defines the output field, which will be the count of treatments meeting the criteria.
*   `Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Treatments` collection.
*   `CONTAINS(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), 'psoriasis')`: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `diag_name` (from the linked `diagnosis` record) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. This handles the case-insensitive wildcard match for 'psoriasis'.
*   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the `drug` linked to the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). The `HAS()` function checks for the existence (non-nullness) of this field.
*   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This compound condition filters treatments based on their `end_dt`:
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` ensures the treatment ended on or after that date (i.e., within the last 6 months).

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition filters treatments where the `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` contains the substring ""psoriasis"". `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `%` are wildcards for matching any sequence of characters.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the `drug` associated with the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`), implying it is FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition filters treatments that ended on or after the date 6 months prior to the current date. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition filters treatments that ended on or before the current date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Target Registration Year**:
    *   `year_context = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(target_registration_year = MAX(Doctors.year_reg) - 2)`:
        This line first determines the latest `year_reg` among all doctors. It then subtracts 2 from this maximum year to define `target_registration_year`. This interprets ""2 years ago"" relative to the most recent registration data available.

2.  **Filter Doctors and Identify First Treatment**:
    *   `year_context.Doctors.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Doctors` collection within the context of `year_context` (making `target_registration_year` available).
    *   `WHERE((year_reg == target_registration_year) & (HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1))`: This filters the doctors to include only those:
        *   Whose `year_reg` matches the calculated `target_registration_year`.
        *   Who have at least one treatment record (`HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`). This ensures that a ""first treatment"" can be found.

We need to return the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates of each qualifying concomitant medication.

Here's how to construct the PyDough query:
1.  Start with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments to include only those where `is_placebo` is true.
3.  Access the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for these placebo treatments.
4.  Filter these `concomitant_meds` based on their `start_dt`. The condition is that the concomitant medication's start date must be on or after the treatment's start date and no more than 14 days after the treatment's start date. This can be checked using `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)`, which should be between 0 and 14 (inclusive). Here, `treatment.start_dt` refers to the start date of the parent treatment, and `start_dt` refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, for each concomitant medication that meets these criteria, use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields:
    *   `treatment_id` from the parent treatment.
    *   `start_dt` from the parent treatment.
    *   `end_dt` from the parent treatment.
    *   `start_dt` from the concomitant medication.
    *   `end_dt` from the concomitant medication.

This will result in a table where each row represents a concomitant medication that satisfies the timing condition, along with details of its parent placebo treatment.

```python
result = Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True).concomitant_meds.WHERE(
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) &
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)

    treatment_end_datetime = treatment.end_dt,
    med_start_datetime = start_dt,
    med_end_datetime = end_dt
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`: This selects all treatments from the `Treatments` collection that are marked as placebo treatments.
2.  `.concomitant_meds`: For each selected placebo treatment, this accesses its associated concomitant medications.
3.  `.WHERE((DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14))`: This filters the concomitant medications.
    *   `treatment.start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` of the current concomitant medication.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the treatment's start and the medication's start.
    *   The condition ensures that the medication started on the same day as the treatment or up to 14 days after the treatment started (i.e., within two weeks).
4.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each concomitant medication that passes the filter, this step selects and renames the required fields:
    *   `treatment_identifier = treatment.treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_datetime = treatment.start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_datetime = treatment.end_dt`: The end date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `med_start_datetime = start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication.
    *   `med_end_datetime = end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

For each such pair, it retrieves the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates of the concomitant medication.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE(is_placebo == True)` to select only placebo treatments.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each selected placebo treatment.
4.  A second `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications. The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures that only medications started on or up to 14 days after the parent treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`) are included. `start_dt` here refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `concomitant_med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from its own `start_dt` field).
    *   `concomitant_med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication (from its own `end_dt` field).

Each row in the output will correspond to a specific concomitant medication that satisfies the conditions, along with details of its parent placebo treatment.

1.  Start with the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter the patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and `ins_type` is 'Private'.
3.  For these filtered patients, calculate their age in years by finding the difference between the current date and their `date_of_birth` using `DATEDIFF`.
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using `AVG`.
5.  Round the final average age to the nearest integer using `ROUND`.
6.  The result will be a single value representing the average age.

```python

This code does the following:
1.  Accesses the `Patients` collection through the main `DermTreatment` graph.
2.  Filters the `Patients` collection using `WHERE` to select only records where `gender` is ""Male"" AND `ins_type` is ""Private"".
3.  Within this filtered set, it uses a nested `CALCULATE` to compute the `age_in_years` for each patient. The age is determined by `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))`, which calculates the number of full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date.
4.  The `AVG` function then calculates the average of these `age_in_years`.
5.  Finally, `ROUND(..., 0)` rounds the calculated average age to the nearest whole number (integer).

3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (obtained using `DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  Round the resulting average age to the nearest integer using the `ROUND` function with 0 decimal places.

Explanation:
-   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want to compute a single aggregated value over the entire dataset.
-   `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'private'))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only male patients who have 'private' insurance. We assume 'private' is the value stored in the `ins_type` field for private insurance.
-   `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age.
    -   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This effectively gives the age in integer years.
    -   The result of this calculation is stored in a temporary field `current_age_in_years`.
-   `.current_age_in_years`: This accesses the calculated ages for the `AVG` function.
-   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients who met the filter criteria.
-   `ROUND(..., 0)`: This rounds the calculated average age to 0 decimal places, effectively providing an integer result as requested.
-   The final average age is assigned to the field `avg_male_patient_age_private_ins`.",31.42279314994812,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions with `status == ""completed""` are successful. We'll look at `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Count the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This can be done by taking `NDISTINCT` of the `coupon_id` from the filtered transactions. `NDISTINCT` will handle cases where no coupon was used (null `coupon_id`) by not counting them.
4.  Count the total number of distinct successful transactions. This is `COUNT` of the filtered successful transactions.
5.  Calculate CPUR using the formula: `number of distinct coupons used / number of distinct successful transactions`.

**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts by iterating through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` clause:
    *   `merchant_name_temp = name`: The merchant's `name` is stored in a temporary variable `merchant_name_temp`.
    *   `num_distinct_coupons_used = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`: This calculates the number of unique coupons. It first filters the `transactions_received` by the merchant to include only those with `status == ""completed""`. Then, `NDISTINCT(coupon_id)` counts the unique `coupon_id` values from these successful transactions.
    *   `num_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`: This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant by filtering `transactions_received` for `status == ""completed""` and then applying `COUNT`.
    *   `CPUR_calculated = IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR. The `IFF` function checks if `num_successful_transactions` is greater than 0.
        *   If true, CPUR is `(1.0 * num_distinct_coupons_used) / num_successful_transactions`. Multiplying by `1.0` helps ensure floating-point division.
        *   If false (i.e., no successful transactions), CPUR is set to `0.0`.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause is used to format the final output:
    *   `merchant_name = merchant_name_temp`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `CPUR = CPUR_calculated`: Selects the calculated CPUR and names the field `CPUR`.

    *   `distinct_transactions_count`: The number of distinct successful transactions. This is found by filtering the merchant's `transactions_received` for those with `status == ""completed""`, then counting the distinct `txid`.

4.  Use the `IFF` function to handle cases where `distinct_transactions_count` is zero (to prevent division by zero), defaulting `CPUR` to `0.0` in such instances.
5.  The final result will include the merchant's name (`name`) and the calculated `CPUR`.

        *   Navigates to `coupon.cid` for these filtered transactions.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter Users**: It starts by selecting `Users` whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""CA"".
2.  **Enhance Notifications Data**: For the `notifications` of these selected users, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start`: The starting date of the week in which the notification was `created_at`. This is achieved by truncating `created_at` to the 'start of week'.
    *   `is_weekend`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the notification was created on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", and `False` otherwise.
3.  **Filter for Past Weeks**: It then filters these enhanced notifications to include only those where `notification_week_start` is before the start of the current week. This ensures we only consider notifications from past full weeks.
4.  **Group by Week**: The filtered past notifications are then partitioned (grouped) by `notification_week_start`. This creates groups of notifications for each past week.
5.  **Aggregate Weekly Stats**: For each weekly group, it calculates:
    *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (the partition key).
    *   `total_notifications`: The total count of notifications within that week's group.
    *   `weekend_notifications`: The count of notifications that occurred on a weekend within that week's group. This is done by summing the `is_weekend` boolean flag (where True is treated as 1 and False as 0).

**Explanation:**

*   `Merchants`: We begin by selecting the `Merchants` collection.
*   `.WHERE((status == ""active"") & (LOWER(category) == ""retail"") & (HAS(coupons) == 1))`: This clause filters the merchants based on three conditions:
    *   `status == ""active""`: Ensures the merchant is currently active.
    *   `LOWER(category) == ""retail""`: Checks if the merchant's category is ""retail"", ignoring case by converting the `category` field to lowercase.
    *   `HAS(coupons) == 1`: Ensures that the merchant has at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS()` function checks for the existence of records in the `coupons` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons))`: For each merchant that passes the filter, this clause calculates two new fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the merchant.
    *   `total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`: Counts the number of coupons associated with each merchant using the `COUNT()` aggregation function on the `coupons` sub-collection.

97,How many wallet transactions were made by users from the US in the last 7 days inclusive of today? Return the number of transactions and total transaction amount.,"SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_transactions, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t JOIN users AS u ON t.sender_id = u.uid WHERE u.country = 'US' AND t.created_at >= DATE('now', '-7 days') AND t.created_at < DATE('now', '+1 day');",Ewallet,"The user wants to find out the number of ""wallet transactions"" and their total amount made by users from the ""US"" within the last 7 days, including today.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Identify US Users' Transactions**: We first need to filter the `Users` collection for those whose `country` is ""US"". Then, we access their sent transactions via the `transactions_sent` sub-collection.
2.  **Filter by Date**: For these transactions, we filter those where the `created_at` date falls within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. This can be achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`.
    *   If a transaction was created today, `DATEDIFF` would be 0.
    *   If a transaction was created 6 days ago, `DATEDIFF` would be 6.
    *   These conditions satisfy `DATEDIFF <= 6`.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: Finally, we use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to compute the total count of these filtered transactions using `COUNT()` and the sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **""Wallet Transactions"" Assumption**: The term ""wallet transactions"" is not explicitly defined by a specific `transaction_type` in the problem. Therefore, we assume all transactions in the `Transactions` collection initiated by users are considered ""wallet transactions"".

```python

2.  For these filtered balance records, group them by `user_id`.
3.  For each user, calculate their AMB by taking the average of their `balance` amounts from the records in their group. This aligns with ""average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". A user might have multiple balance entries if their balance was updated multiple times during the week; these will be averaged for that user.
4.  Finally, calculate the average of all these per-user AMBs. This will give the overall average AMB for wallets updated in the specified period.

2.  **Calculate AMB per User**:
    *   The filtered balances are then partitioned by `user_id`. This groups all recent balance entries for each user.
    *   For each user group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute `user_specific_amb = AVG(UserBalances.balance)`. This calculates the average balance for each specific user based on their balance entries from the past week, fulfilling the definition of AMB for that user over the specified period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, it calculates the average of all these `user_specific_amb` values. This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `user_specific_amb` field from the collection generated in the previous step. The result is stored in a field named `average_balance`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for entries updated in the past week (inclusive of 7 days ago).

1. Access each user.
2. For each user, look at all their balance entries in the `UserBalances` collection (accessed via `Users.balances`).
3. Identify the balance entry with the most recent `updated_at` timestamp.
4. Report the user's identifier (e.g., `uid`) and this latest balance amount.

We will filter out users who have no balance entries. For users with balance entries, we use the `RANKING` window function to find the latest balance.

```python
user_latest_balances = Users.WHERE(HAS(balances) == 1).CALCULATE(
    user_uid=uid,
    LUB=balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1).SINGULAR().balance
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(HAS(balances) == 1)`**:
    *   We start with the `Users` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(balances) == 1)` filters these users to include only those who have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (i.e., at least one `UserBalances` record).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each user who passes the filter, we calculate new fields.

3.  **`user_uid=uid`**:
    *   We select the `uid` of the user and name it `user_uid`.

4.  **`LUB=balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1).SINGULAR().balance`**:
    *   This expression calculates the Latest User Balance (LUB).
    *   **`balances`**: Accesses the `balances` sub-collection for the current user. These are records from the `UserBalances` collection.
    *   **`.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**:
        *   This filters the balance entries for the current user to find the most recent one.
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: Ranks the balance entries.
            *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Orders the balances by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (most recent first).
            *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures that this ranking is performed independently for each user (i.e., the rank is reset for each user's set of balances).
        *   `== 1`: Selects only the balance entry that is ranked first (the most recent one).
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause is designed to return exactly one balance record (the latest), `SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record, allowing access to its fields.
    *   **`.balance`**: Extracts the `balance` amount from that single, most recent user balance record. This value is assigned to `LUB`.

3.  To determine the `LUB`, we look into the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user. These are `UserBalances` records, each having an `updated_at` timestamp and a `balance` amount.

    *   `calculated_revenue = SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   This calculates the total revenue for each merchant.
        *   It accesses `transactions_received`, which are transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
        *   It filters these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where:
            *   `status == 'completed'` (successfully received).
            *   `receiver_type == 1` (confirming the transaction was intended for a merchant type receiver, as per the problem's filter requirement).
        *   `SUM(...)` then adds up the `amount` of these filtered transactions. If a merchant has no such transactions, this sum will typically be 0 or null.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant**:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue. This revenue is the sum of `amount` from their `transactions_received`.
    *   These transactions are filtered to include only those that were ""successfully received"" (assumed `status == ""completed""`) and where the `receiver_type` on the transaction record is 1 (as specified for merchants).
    *   The merchant's `name` and `category` are also selected. These intermediate results are stored in `merchant_data`.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Output**:
    *   Using the `merchant_data` (which now has `m_name`, `m_category`, and `m_revenue` for each merchant), we perform a second `CALCULATE`.
    *   We select the `merchant_name` (from `m_name`), `category` (from `m_category`), and `revenue_amount` (from `m_revenue`).
    *   The `revenue_rank` is computed using the `RANKING()` window function. It ranks merchants in descending order of their `m_revenue` (so rank 1 is the highest revenue), which aligns with the definition of MRR.
    *   The final result includes the merchant's name, category, their total revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition**:
    *   `current_month_start_date`: Marks the beginning of the current month. This is used as an exclusive end boundary for our period.
    *   `start_date_for_period`: Calculated as two months before `current_month_start_date`. This marks the inclusive start boundary. For example, if it's July, this period covers May and June.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`relevant_wallet_transactions`)**:
    *   The `Transactions` collection is filtered to include only records where:
        *   `created_at` falls within the defined date range (`start_date_for_period` to `current_month_start_date`).
        *   `sender_type` is `0`, as specified for wallet transactions relevant to PMDAU.

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`monthly_sender_activity`)**:
    *   A `CALCULATE` step transforms the filtered transactions:
        *   `activity_month`: The `created_at` timestamp is truncated to the first day of its month (e.g., ""2023-05-15"" becomes ""2023-05-01""). This will be used for grouping.
        *   `transaction_sender_id`: The `sender_id` is selected (and renamed for clarity) to be used for counting distinct senders.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`)**:
    *   `PARTITION(...)`: The `monthly_sender_activity` data is partitioned (grouped) by `activity_month`. Each partition, named `senders_per_month_group`, contains all activity for a specific month.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each month's partition:
        *   `year_and_month`: The `activity_month` (e.g., ""2023-05-01"") is selected as the identifier for the month.
        *   `pmdau`: The `NDISTINCT` function counts the number of unique `transaction_sender_id` values within the `senders_per_month_group` (i.e., for that specific month). This count represents the PMDAU for that month, according to the provided definition.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year_and_month.ASC())`: The final results are sorted by month in ascending order.

1.  **Determine the Date Range**: We need to identify transactions that occurred from the start of the month, two months prior to the current month, up to the start of the current month (exclusive). For example, if the current date is in July, we'll consider transactions from May 1st up to (but not including) July 1st.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this calculated date range and have a `sender_type` of 0, as per the PMDAU definition.
3.  **Extract Temporal Information**: For each relevant transaction, extract the year and month from its `created_at` timestamp. This is necessary for monthly aggregation. We also carry forward the `sender_id` for the distinct count.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the filtered transactions by year and month. For each year-month group, calculate the PMDAU by counting the number of distinct `sender_id`s.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by year and month for clarity.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python

final_pmdau_result = pmdau_calculation.ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `two_months_ago_start_date` and `current_month_start_date` are contextless expressions defining the time window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')` calculates the date for the start of the month that was two full months prior to the current month.
2.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified date range and were initiated by a sender of `sender_type = 0`.
3.  The first `CALCULATE` call on `relevant_transactions_for_pmdau` creates a new collection `transactions_with_month_info`. For each transaction, it adds `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` (extracted from `created_at`) and includes `sender_id` under the new name `sender_id_val`. This prepares the data for monthly aggregation.
4.  `PARTITION(name=""monthly_active_users_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))` groups the `transactions_with_month_info` data by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
5.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these monthly groups. It outputs `year_of_transaction` and `month_of_transaction` (which are the partitioning keys) and `pmdau`. The `pmdau` is calculated using `NDISTINCT(sender_id_val)`, which counts the unique sender IDs within each monthly group, fulfilling the PMDAU definition.
6.  Finally, `ORDER_BY(year_of_transaction.ASC(), month_of_transaction.ASC())` sorts the monthly PMDAU figures chronologically.",58.97687530517578,"# Define the date boundaries for the query:

2.  `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id, duration_in_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each filtered session, this calculates a new field `duration_in_seconds`. `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", ...)` computes the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds. The `user_id` is also carried forward.
3.  `sessions_filtered_with_duration.PARTITION(name=""user_sessions_group"", by=(user_id))`: This takes the records from the previous step (sessions with their individual durations) and groups them by `user_id`. Each group, named `user_sessions_group`, contains all sessions for a particular user.
4.  `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id, total_duration = SUM(user_sessions_group.duration_in_seconds))`: For each user group (partition), this calculates two fields:
    *   `user_id`: The ID of the user for that group.

    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).
    *   Filter these sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01T00:00:00"" and before ""2023-06-08T00:00:00"".
    *   For each filtered session, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`.
    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).
5.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested.

```python
# Calculate total session duration for each user within the specified date range
user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(
    # Store the user's ID (uid) for later use in the final output

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each user in the `Users` collection.
    *   `user_id_val = uid`: We store the user's unique identifier (`uid`) as `user_id_val`.
    *   `total_duration_val = SUM(...)`: For each user, we calculate the sum of session durations.
        *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the user's `sessions` (which are `UserSessions` records linked to this user) and filter them based on the `session_start_ts` to include only those within the range \[2023-06-01 00:00:00, 2023-06-08 00:00:00).
        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a contextless expression. It calculates the timestamp corresponding to exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`). This timestamp will serve as the lower bound for our time window.
2.  `sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)`: This line accesses the `UserSessions` collection and filters its records. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is greater than or equal to `one_month_ago_ts`. This effectively selects all sessions that occurred from one month ago up to the present.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month))`: This line calculates the final result.

3.  Among these, filter transactions that were ""successful"". We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` field is ""completed"".
4.  Count the number of successful transactions and the total number of transactions.
5.  Calculate STR using the provided formula: `STR = (number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We will express this as a percentage.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block determines the target year (`_previous_month_year`) and month (`_previous_month_month`) for ""the previous month"" by taking the current date, going to the start of the current month, and then subtracting one month.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` block computes two counts based on the `Transactions` collection:
    *   `_num_successful_transactions`: This counts transactions that occurred in the `_previous_month_year` and `_previous_month_month` AND have a `status` of ""completed"". This assumes ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction.
    *   `_num_total_transactions`: This counts all transactions that occurred in the `_previous_month_year` and `_previous_month_month`.
3.  The final `CALCULATE` block computes the `str_previous_month`:
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_num_total_transactions` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
    *   If there are total transactions, it calculates STR as `(_num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / _num_total_transactions` to get a percentage.

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll calculate the start and end dates for the previous month based on the current date. The previous month starts on the first day of the month preceding the current month and ends on the last day of that same month (or, equivalently, just before the first day of the current month).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated ""previous month"" period using their `created_at` timestamp.
3.  **Identify Successful Transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`. This is a common convention, but if a different status indicates success, this condition should be adjusted.
4.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions that occurred in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (as defined above) within that same period.
5.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We'll ensure this is a floating-point division and handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).

We will use contextless expressions to define the date boundaries and the initial filtered set of transactions for clarity. The final result will be a single value representing the STR for the previous month.

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the previous month using contextless expressions.
# _prev_month_start_boundary is the first moment of the previous month.
_prev_month_start_boundary = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-1 month')
# _current_month_start_boundary is the first moment of the current month, serving as the exclusive end for the previous month.
_current_month_start_boundary = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')

# ""Wallet transactions"" are assumed to be all transactions in the Transactions collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `_prev_month_start_boundary`: This contextless expression calculates the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, this will be June 1st, 00:00:00.
2.  `_current_month_start_boundary`: This calculates the first moment of the current month (e.g., July 1st, 00:00:00). This serves as the exclusive upper bound for the ""previous month"" period.
3.  `_transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `_prev_month_start_boundary` and before `_current_month_start_boundary`.
4.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `_transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is `""completed""`.
    *   `num_total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions in `_transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  The second `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `str_value`: Computes the Success Transaction Rate. It uses `IFF` to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero. If there are transactions, it calculates the ratio; otherwise, it defaults to `0.0`. The `1.0 *` ensures the division results in a float.
6.  The final `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `previous_month_str = str_value`: This selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str` for the final output, ensuring the result contains just this single requested value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_creation_details`: We first process the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, we use `CALCULATE` to extract their `mid` (aliased as `merchant_identifier`), `name` (aliased as `merchant_actual_name`), and derive their creation year (`merchant_creation_yr`) and month (`merchant_creation_mth`) from their `created_at` timestamp.
2.  `merchant_coupon_counts`: We then perform another `CALCULATE` on the result. For each merchant (with their derived creation year and month), we access their `coupons` sub-collection. We filter these coupons to include only those where the coupon's `created_at` year and month match the merchant's `merchant_creation_yr` and `merchant_creation_mth`. The `COUNT` function then counts how many such coupons exist for each merchant, storing this as `num_coupons_in_creation_month`.
3.  `top_merchant_by_coupons`: We use `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` to find the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. The `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest count.

    *   `merchant_create_year=YEAR(created_at), merchant_create_month=MONTH(created_at)`: We extract the year and month of the merchant's creation date.
2.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` is then piped into a second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `m_id=m_id, m_name=m_name`: We carry forward the merchant's ID and name.
    *   `num_coupons_in_creation_month=COUNT(...)`: This is the core logic.

        *   `(YEAR(created_at) == merchant_create_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == merchant_create_month)`: This condition ensures that we only consider coupons whose creation year and month match the `merchant_create_year` and `merchant_create_month` (calculated in the previous step for the current merchant).
        *   `COUNT(...)`: We count how many coupons satisfy this condition for the current merchant.
3.  `merchant_coupon_info.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `Users` collection and applying filters.

    *   **`HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`**: This condition checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: We look into the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `(notification_type == 'promotional')`: Filters for notifications that are 'promotional'.
        *   `(status == 'unread')`: Filters for notifications that have a status of 'unread'.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Ensures that only users who have one or more such notifications are included.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, we use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields.

    *   **`total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`**: Calculates the total number of unread promotional notifications for each selected user.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the notifications.
        *   `notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`: This is the same filter applied inside `HAS` to ensure we are counting the correct set of notifications.

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table. It selects transactions that:
    *   Occurred in 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   Were initiated by a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
    *   Were successful (`status == ""successful""`).
    *   Were sent by a user who is currently marked as active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
2.  `transactions_with_month_and_user_id`: This `CALCULATE` step processes the `filtered_transactions`. For each transaction, it:
    *   Derives `transaction_month_asat_date` by taking the `created_at` timestamp and truncating it to the start of its month (e.g., ""2023-01-15 10:00:00"" becomes ""2023-01-01 00:00:00""). This provides a consistent date value for each month.
    *   Extracts `sender_user_uid` which is the `uid` of the `sending_user`. This ID will be used for counting distinct users.
3.  `monthly_distinct_active_users`: This is the core aggregation step.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_sends"", by=(transaction_month_asat_date))` groups the records from `transactions_with_month_and_user_id` based on the `transaction_month_asat_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., each month).
        *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_asat_date`: Selects the month (which is the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(transactions_with_month_and_user_id.sender_user_uid)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_user_uid` values within that month's group. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
4.  `result`: This line orders the `monthly_distinct_active_users` by `month_as_date` in ascending order, so the earliest month appears first. The final result will contain two columns: `month_as_date` and `num_distinct_users`.",47.2325553894043,"# Step 1 & 2: Filter transactions for 2023, by active users (not merchants), and successful status.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions where `sender_type` is 0, indicating the sender was a user.
2.  For these filtered transactions, we use `CALCULATE` to create a new set of fields:
    *   `country_of_sender`: The country of the user who sent the transaction, obtained via `sending_user.country`.
    *   `sender_user_id_val`: The unique ID of the sending user, obtained via `sending_user.uid`. This is used for counting distinct users.
    *   `tx_amount_val`: The `amount` of the transaction. Renaming helps clarify its use in subsequent calculations.
3.  Next, we `PARTITION` these `enriched_transactions` by `country_of_sender`. This groups all transactions based on the country of the sending user.
4.  For each country group created by the partition, we `CALCULATE` the aggregate values:
    *   `country`: This is the `country_of_sender` (the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_senders`: The number of unique users who sent transactions from this country. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT` on the `sender_user_id_val` field from the `enriched_transactions` within the current country partition.
    *   `total_amount_sent`: The sum of all transaction amounts (`tx_amount_val`) sent from this country. This is calculated using `SUM` on the `tx_amount_val` field from the `enriched_transactions` within the current country partition.

1.  Define a common filter expression, `recent_merchant_transactions_filter`, to identify relevant transactions. These are transactions received by a merchant (`receiver_type == 1`) within the last 150 days (inclusive). The date condition `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150` checks if the transaction's `created_at` date is within this period.
2.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
3.  Filter these merchants using `WHERE(HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(recent_merchant_transactions_filter)) == 1)`. This ensures that we only consider merchants who have at least one transaction matching our defined filter. This pre-filtering step improves efficiency.
4.  Use the `CALCULATE` method to compute the required information for each of these merchants:
    *   `merchant_name`: The `name` of the merchant.
    *   `total_num_transactions`: The `COUNT` of transactions received by the merchant that satisfy the `recent_merchant_transactions_filter`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The `SUM` of the `amount` for transactions received by the merchant that satisfy the `recent_merchant_transactions_filter`.
5.  Finally, use `TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 2 merchants based on their `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

3.  For each of these filtered merchants, access their `balances` sub-collection. Since `balances` is a list and could potentially contain historical balance records, we need to identify the most current balance entry. We achieve this by using the `RANKING` function, ordering the balance entries by `updated_at` in descending order, partitioned per merchant (`per=""Merchants""`). We select the entry ranked as 1 (the latest).
4.  This gives us a collection of the most recent `MerchantBalance` records, one for each qualifying merchant.
5.  Finally, we calculate the `MEDIAN` of the `balance` attribute from these current balance records. This calculation is done at the `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single result.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == 'active'`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, 'retail')`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   `HAS(balances) == 1`: Ensures that the selected merchants have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (i.e., they have `MerchantBalances` records).
2.  `.CALCULATE(latest_balance_value = ...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered merchants. For each such merchant, it calculates a new field named `latest_balance_value`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This accesses the `balances` sub-collection for the current merchant. It then ranks these balance records by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each merchant. The `WHERE` clause filters these to keep only the top-ranked (most recent) balance record.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should yield exactly one record (the most recent balance), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record.
    *   `.balance`: This extracts the `balance` amount from that single, most recent `MerchantBalances` record.
    *   The result of this `CALCULATE` step is a new collection where each record corresponds to a filtered merchant and contains their `latest_balance_value`.
3.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_wallet_balance = MEDIAN(...))`: This takes the collection of `latest_balance_value`s (obtained by `.latest_balance_value` from the previous step's result) and calculates their median.
    *   `MEDIAN(collection.attribute)`: The `MEDIAN` function computes the median value of the specified `attribute` across all records in the `collection`.
    *   The final result is a single value representing the median wallet balance, assigned to the field `median_wallet_balance`.",68.88120651245117,"result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(

1.  Filter the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only snapshots taken in the year 2023.

3.  Filter these ranked snapshots to keep only those with rank 1, which correspond to the earliest snapshot(s) in 2023.
4.  Finally, calculate the average of `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` from this group of earliest snapshots. This will result in a single row containing the two average values.

**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only records where the `snapshot_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered 2023 snapshots.
    *   `tx_limit_daily_val = tx_limit_daily`, `tx_limit_monthly_val = tx_limit_monthly`: These expressions select the daily and monthly transaction limits, assigning them to new field names for clarity or further use.
    *   `date_rank = RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates a rank for each snapshot within the 2023 set. `by=snapshot_date.ASC()` orders them from earliest to latest. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest `snapshot_date`, they all receive rank 1.
3.  `snapshots_2023_ranked.WHERE(date_rank == 1)`: This filters the ranked snapshots, keeping only those that have `date_rank` equal to 1. These are the earliest snapshots from 2023.
4.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation is performed at the top `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single row of results.
    *   `average_tx_limit_daily = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_daily_val)`: This computes the average of the `tx_limit_daily_val` from all the snapshots identified as ""earliest"" in 2023.
    *   `average_tx_limit_monthly = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_monthly_val)`: Similarly, this computes the average of the `tx_limit_monthly_val` for the same set of earliest snapshots.

2.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
3.  Filter out merchants who have no coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
4.  Use `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `merchant_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `registration_date`.
    *   The ID (`cid`) of the earliest coupon as `earliest_coupon_id`, using the `earliest_coupon` expression.
    *   The start date (`start_date`) of the earliest coupon as `earliest_coupon_start_date`, also using the `earliest_coupon` expression.
5.  Use a subsequent `WHERE` clause to filter these records. The condition ensures that the `earliest_coupon_start_date` is:

    *   On or before one year after the `registration_date`. We use `DATETIME(registration_date, '1 year')` to calculate the date one year after registration.

4.  We then filter these merchants using a `WHERE` clause. The condition is that the earliest coupon's `start_date` must be within one year of the merchant's `created_at` (registration date). This is checked by ensuring that the difference in days, calculated by `DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant_registration_date, earliest_coupon_start_date)`, is between 0 and 365, inclusive.

    *   The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check if this filtered set of early notifications is empty. If it's empty, it means the user either had no notifications at all, or all their notifications occurred after their first year.
4.  Finally, for the users who meet this condition, we select their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`).

```python
users_no_early_notification = Users.WHERE(
    HASNOT(
        notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))
    ) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    username=username,
    email=email,
    signup_date=created_at
)
```
**Explanation:**

*   `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
*   `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This is the core condition. It checks if a user does *not* have any notifications meeting the criteria specified in the inner `WHERE` clause.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(created_at <= DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`: This filters a user's notifications to include only those whose `created_at` timestamp is less than or equal to one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp (signup date).
        *   `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`: This function calculates the timestamp exactly one year after the user's signup date. `Users.created_at` here refers to the `created_at` field of the current user being evaluated. The inner `created_at` refers to `Notifications.created_at`.
*   If the result of `notifications.WHERE(...)` is an empty collection (meaning no notifications were found within the first year), `HASNOT` will be true, and the user will be included.
*   `.CALCULATE(username=username, email=email, signup_date=created_at)`: For the users who satisfy the condition, this part selects their `username`, `email`, and their original `created_at` field, which is aliased as `signup_date` in the output.",34.72108054161072,"users_no_early_notification = Users.WHERE(

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, calculate two helper fields:
    *   `user_signup_date_field`: This will store the user's `created_at` timestamp, representing their signup date.
    *   `end_of_first_year_field`: This will be calculated as exactly one year after `user_signup_date_field` using the `DATETIME` function.
3.  Filter these users based on their notifications:
    *   A user is kept if they have *no* notifications whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the interval `[user_signup_date_field, end_of_first_year_field)`.
    *   This is achieved by using `HASNOT` on the `notifications` sub-collection. The sub-collection is first filtered to include only those notifications created on or after the user's signup date and strictly before the calculated `end_of_first_year_field`.
4.  Finally, for the users who meet this criterion, select their `username`, `email`, and their original signup date (which we stored in `user_signup_date_field` and will output as `signup_date`).

result = Users.CALCULATE(
    user_signup_date_field=created_at,
