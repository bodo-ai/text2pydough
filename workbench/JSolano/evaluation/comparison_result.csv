**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the entries in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates two fields:
    *   `customer_name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `success_rate=...`: Calculates the success rate.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'Completed'))`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer where the `status` field is exactly 'Completed'. This is assumed to represent a successful transaction.
        *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the total number of transactions for the customer.
        *   The division calculates the ratio of successful transactions to total transactions. Multiplying by `100.0` converts this ratio to a percentage and ensures the calculation uses floating-point arithmetic.
3.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: This sorts the resulting collection in ascending order based on the calculated `success_rate`. Customers with the lowest success rates will appear first.",23.338220834732056,"# Filter customers to include only those with at least 5 transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`**: This defines a Python tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies for easier reference in the query.
2.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` object because we want a single aggregated result (the total count). `CALCULATE` is used to compute this final value.
3.  **`num_faang_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define the output field `num_faang_customers` and use the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of customers that meet the specified criteria.
4.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply filtering conditions using `WHERE`.
5.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`**: This is the first condition. It filters customers whose `email` field ends with the string "".com"".

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the key date boundaries using the `Broker` top-level collection:
    *   `start_of_current_week`: Finds the date corresponding to the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday, depending on system settings) using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_period`: Calculates the date 8 weeks prior to the `start_of_current_week` using `DATETIME(..., '-8 weeks')`. This marks the beginning of our analysis window.

2.  **`transactions_in_period`**: We access the `Transactions` collection via `time_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates).
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: Filters transactions to include only those whose `date_time` falls on or after `start_of_period` and strictly before `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting the 8 full weeks preceding the current one.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction:
        *   `transaction_week_start`: Determines the start date of the week the transaction belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_flag`: Creates a numerical flag. It checks if the `DAYNAME` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using `ISIN`. If true, `IFF` returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

3.  **`weekly_transaction_summary`**: This performs the main aggregation.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_groups"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the `transactions_in_period` collection into distinct weeks based on the calculated `transaction_week_start` date.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week_starting_date`: Selects the `transaction_week_start` value (which is the same for all transactions in the group) to identify the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions`: Sums the `is_weekend_flag` for all transactions in the group using `SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_flag)`. Since the flag is 1 for weekend transactions and 0 otherwise, the sum gives the count of weekend transactions.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries in chronological order based on their start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate two key dates using the `Broker` top-level collection:
    *   `current_week_start_date`: The start date of the current week (e.g., the most recent Monday if the week starts on Monday).
    *   `eight_weeks_ago_start_date`: The start date of the week that began 8 weeks prior to the `current_week_start_date`.
2.  **`stock_transactions_info`**: We access `Transactions` through `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates, though not strictly necessary for this step but good practice).
    *   We filter transactions where the associated `ticker` has a `ticker_type` of 'Stock'.
    *   We calculate `transaction_week_start` for each transaction using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
    *   We calculate `is_weekend_transaction`, a boolean flag which is `True` if the transaction's `date_time` falls on a Saturday or Sunday (using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`), and `False` otherwise.
3.  **`transactions_last_8_weeks`**: We filter `stock_transactions_info` to keep only transactions whose `transaction_week_start` falls within the desired range: on or after `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` AND before `current_week_start_date`. This selects the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
4.  **`weekly_stock_counts`**:
    *   We partition the `transactions_last_8_weeks` collection by the `transaction_week_start` date. This groups all transactions from the same week together.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` applied to these weekly partitions:
        *   `week_starting_on`: We select the `transaction_week_start` date, renaming it for clarity in the output.
        *   `total_transactions_count`: We use `COUNT(Transactions)` to count all the original transactions within each weekly group.
        *   `weekend_transactions_count`: We use `SUM(stock_transactions_info.is_weekend_transaction)` to sum the boolean flag we calculated earlier. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in sums, this effectively counts the number of weekend transactions within the group.
    *   Finally, `.ORDER_BY(week_starting_on.ASC())` sorts the weekly results chronologically.
5.  **`result = weekly_stock_counts`**: The final result containing the weekly counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",36.0641565322876,"# Define the start date of the current week and the start date 8 weeks prior.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries at the top `Broker` level.
    *   `start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the timestamp for the beginning of the current week based on the current time ('now').
    *   `start_of_last_week = DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of week'), '-7 days')`: Calculates the start of the previous week by taking the start of the current week and subtracting 7 days.
2.  **`result = date_boundaries.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform the final aggregation, referencing the date boundaries calculated previously.
    *   **`num_transactions = COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of transactions that meet the specified criteria.
        *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(customer.country == ""USA"")`: Selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".
        *   `(date_time >= start_of_last_week)`: Ensures the transaction date is on or after the start of last week.
        *   `(date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Ensures the transaction date is before the start of the current week, effectively selecting only transactions from *last* week.
        *   The `&` operator combines these conditions.
    *   **`total_transaction_amount = SUM(...)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for the same set of filtered transactions.
        *   It applies the identical `WHERE` clause to filter transactions from US customers last week.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.

2.  **`result = date_boundaries.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform another `CALCULATE` operation, using the previously calculated date boundaries.
    *   **`num_transactions=COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(...))`**: This calculates the total number of transactions.
        *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Transactions` collection and filter it based on multiple conditions combined with `&` (AND).
        *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Filters for transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".
        *   `date_time >= start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred on or after the start of last week.
        *   `date_time < start_of_current_week`: Ensures the transaction occurred before the start of the current week, effectively defining the end boundary of ""last week"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions that satisfy all the `WHERE` conditions.
    *   **`total_transaction_amount=SUM(Transactions.WHERE(...).amount)`**: This calculates the sum of the transaction amounts for the *same* set of filtered transactions.
        *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: The same filter conditions as above are applied to select the relevant transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to compute three new fields for each customer:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with the customer using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)`.
2.  **`result = customer_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the intermediate `customer_stats` collection and performs another `CALCULATE`:
    *   It keeps the previously calculated `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.
    *   It calculates `CR` (Customer Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. `RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` ranks the customers based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1). Since no `per` argument is specified, the ranking is performed across all customers in the `customer_stats` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply two filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `transaction_type == 'buy'`: Selects only buy transactions.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: Filters transactions that occurred within the last 10 days (inclusive of today). `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days.
2.  **Calculate Ticker Symbol:** We use `CALCULATE` to add the `ticker_symbol` (obtained from the related `ticker` record) to each filtered transaction record. This is needed so `ticker_symbol` can be used as a simple field name in the `PARTITION` step.
3.  **Partition by Ticker:** We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions based on their `ticker_symbol`. Each group (`ticker_group`) contains all the recent buy transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **Count Transactions per Ticker:** We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `ticker_symbol` group:
    *   We select the `ticker_symbol` (which is the partition key).
    *   We use `COUNT(Transactions)` to count the number of original transaction records within that specific ticker symbol's group, naming this count `num_buy_transactions`.
5.  **Select Top 2:** Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 groups (ticker symbols) with the highest `num_buy_transactions`, ordered from highest to lowest count.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final result containing the top 2 ticker symbols and their corresponding buy transaction counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",22.12946438789368,"# Step 1: Filter transactions to include only 'buy' types within the last 10 days.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_with_symbol = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection and use `CALCULATE` to explicitly create a `ticker_symbol` field by accessing the related `ticker`'s `symbol`. This makes it easier to use as a partition key later.
2.  **`recent_buy_transactions = transactions_with_symbol.WHERE(...)`**: We filter these transactions based on two conditions combined with `&`:
    *   `transaction_type == ""buy""`: Selects only buy transactions.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: Selects transactions where the difference in days between the `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 10 days or less.
3.  **`partitioned_by_ticker = recent_buy_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: We group the filtered buy transactions using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""ticker_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not used directly in the final `CALCULATE`).
    *   `by=(ticker_symbol)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `ticker_symbol` we calculated earlier.
4.  **`ticker_buy_counts = partitioned_by_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we calculate:
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol`: We select the ticker symbol itself (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_buy_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: We count the number of transactions within that specific ticker symbol's group. Since we filtered *before* partitioning, this counts the relevant buy transactions from the last 10 days for that symbol.
5.  **`top_2_bought_tickers = ticker_buy_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: We use `TOP_K` to select the top results from the calculated counts.
    *   `2`: Specifies that we want the top 2 results.
    *   `by=num_buy_transactions.DESC()`: Orders the results by the `num_buy_transactions` field in descending order (highest count first) before taking the top 2.
6.  **`result = top_2_bought_tickers`**: The final result containing the top 2 ticker symbols and their buy transaction counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",25.04819083213806,"# Calculate the ticker symbol for each transaction first

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first define `start_date` (6 months before the start of the current month) and `end_date` (the start of the current month) using the `DATETIME` function to establish the time window.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Customers**: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the calculated `start_date` and `end_date`. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `signup_year` and `signup_month` from their `join_date`.
3.  **Partition by Signup Month**: The `customer_info` collection is partitioned using `PARTITION` based on the `signup_year` and `signup_month`. This groups customers who signed up in the same month.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: Within each monthly group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   `signup_period`: We create a formatted string ""YYYY-MM"" representing the signup month using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting (e.g., ""2023-05"").
    *   `pmcs`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` within each partition group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   `pmat`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT) by taking the average (`AVG`) of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within that specific signup month group.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, `ORDER_BY(signup_period.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically based on the signup month.",24.70271921157837,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the time window.
    *   `start_date` is calculated by taking the current date (`'now'`), going to the start of the current month (`'start of month'`), and subtracting 6 months (`'-6 months'`).
    *   `end_date` is calculated by taking the current date, going to the start of the current month, and subtracting 1 day (`'-1 day'`), effectively getting the last day of the previous month.
2.  **`customers_in_period = date_info.Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection via `date_info` (to use the calculated dates) and filter them using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `join_date` falls between `start_date` and `end_date` (inclusive).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(signup_year=..., signup_month=...)`**: For the filtered customers, we extract the `YEAR` and `MONTH` from their `join_date` and store them as `signup_year` and `signup_month`.
4.  **`monthly_customer_stats = customers_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `customers_in_period` collection.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups""`: Names the partition groups.
    *   `by=(signup_year, signup_month)`: Groups the customers based on the year and month they signed up.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition group (each month/year):
    *   `month_year = JOIN_STRINGS(...)`: Creates a formatted string ""YYYY-MM"" for display, using `LPAD` to ensure the month has two digits (e.g., ""09"").
    *   `pmcs = COUNT(Customers)`: Calculates the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` records within the current partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_daily_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `DailyPrices` collection to include only records where the `date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. It uses `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` to achieve this. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days between the record's `date` and now. A difference of 6 or less means the date falls within the desired 7-day window (today + previous 6 days).
2.  **`partitioned_by_type = recent_daily_prices.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered `recent_daily_prices` into groups based on the `ticker_type`. The `ticker_type` is accessed via the relationship `ticker.ticker_type`. Each group in `partitioned_by_type` corresponds to a unique `ticker_type` found within the filtered data.
3.  **`ticker_type_acp = partitioned_by_type.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result for each partition group.
    *   `ticker_type = ticker.ticker_type`: Selects the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP = AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: Calculates the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each group. It applies the `AVG` aggregation function to the `close` field of the `DailyPrices` records that belong to the current partition group (i.e., have the same `ticker_type` and fall within the 7-day window).
4.  **`result = ticker_type_acp`**: Assigns the final calculated data (ticker types and their corresponding ACPs) to the `result` variable.",23.63895273208618,"# Filter DailyPrices for records within the last 7 days, inclusive of today.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022_with_transactions`**:
    *   Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Filters customers using `WHERE` to include only those who joined in 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`) AND have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to select the `country` and create a new boolean/numeric field `is_active`. This field is `True` (evaluates as 1 in aggregations) if the customer's `status` is 'Active', and `False` (evaluates as 0) otherwise.

2.  **`country_activity_ratio`**:
    *   Takes the filtered `customers_2022_with_transactions`.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group these customers by their `country`. The group name is `country_group`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Selects the `country` for each group.
        *   Calculates the `AR` (Activity Ratio):
            *   `SUM(customers_2022_with_transactions.is_active)`: Sums the `is_active` flag for all customers within the current country partition. This effectively counts the number of active customers with transactions in that country.
            *   `COUNT(customers_2022_with_transactions)`: Counts the total number of customers within the current country partition (all of whom have transactions due to the initial filter).
            *   The ratio of these two counts is multiplied by `100.0` (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division) to get the percentage as defined by the AR formula.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_filtered`**: This variable filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`) AND have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
2.  **`country_groups`**: This partitions the `customers_filtered` data based on the `country` field. Each partition (`country_group`) contains customers from the same country who meet the initial filter criteria.
3.  **`country_activity_ratio`**: This calculates the required metrics for each country partition:
    *   `country=country`: Selects the country name (the partition key).
    *   `active_customers_count=SUM(IFF(Customers.status == 'Active', 1, 0))`: Counts the number of customers within the partition group whose `status` is 'Active'. `IFF` returns 1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise, and `SUM` adds these up.
    *   `total_customers_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the total number of customers within the partition group (all of whom joined in 2022 and have transactions).
    *   `AR=DEFAULT_TO(...)`: Calculates the Activity Ratio as per the definition: `(active_customers_count / total_customers_count) * 100.0`. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` is used as a safeguard against division by zero, setting AR to 0 in such unlikely cases.
4.  **`result`**: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the `country` and the calculated `AR` from the `country_activity_ratio` collection, providing the requested output format.",30.96515965461731,"# Step 1: Filter customers who joined in 2022 and have made at least one transaction.

2.  **`num_matching_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_matching_customers` and assign it the count of the records returned by the inner expression.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply filtering conditions using `WHERE`.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` / `LOWER(state)`**: We convert the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
5.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we need a single aggregated result (the count).
2.  **`customer_count=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `customer_count` which will hold the result of the `COUNT` aggregation.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the name condition.
    *   `LOWER(name)` converts the customer's name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `STARTSWITH(..., 'j')` checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')` checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|` (OR) combines these two conditions, so the customer's name must satisfy at least one of them.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This part checks the state condition.
    *   `LOWER(state)` converts the state name to lowercase.
    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'a')` checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
6.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines the name condition and the state condition. A customer must satisfy *both* sets of criteria to be included in the count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This selects records from the `Transactions` collection, filtering for those where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"" and the `date_time` is within the last month (from exactly one month ago up to the current time, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
2.  **`transactions_with_symbol`**: This takes the filtered transactions and calculates the `ticker_symbol` by accessing the related `ticker` collection. It also includes `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` so these values are available for aggregation after partitioning.
3.  **`ticker_groups`**: This partitions the `transactions_with_symbol` data into groups based on the unique `ticker_symbol`. Each group contains all the relevant sell transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **`ticker_aggregates`**: For each `ticker_group`, this calculates the sum of `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` using the `SUM` aggregation function applied to the `Transactions` within that group's context. It retains the `ticker_symbol` as the grouping key.
5.  **`result`**: This final step takes the aggregated results and calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) using the provided formula: `(Total Amount - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`. An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, preventing division by zero errors and assigning an SPM of 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sell_transactions_last_month`**: Filters the `Transactions` collection to include only records where `transaction_type` is ""sell"" and the `date_time` is within the last month (from exactly one month ago up to the current time, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
2.  **`transactions_with_ticker`**: Calculates the `ticker_symbol` for each filtered transaction by accessing the related `ticker` record. This symbol is needed for grouping. The original `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` fields remain accessible for later aggregation.
3.  **`ticker_groups`**: Partitions the `transactions_with_ticker` data into groups based on the unique `ticker_symbol`. Each group (`ticker_data`) contains all the relevant transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **`spm_per_ticker`**: Calculates the required values for each partition group:
    *   `ticker_symbol`: The partitioning key.
    *   `total_amount_val`: Sums the `amount` of all transactions within the current ticker group.
    *   `total_tax_val`: Sums the `tax` of all transactions within the current ticker group.
    *   `total_commission_val`: Sums the `commission` of all transactions within the current ticker group.
    *   `spm_calc`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) using the provided formula and the calculated sums. It uses `IFF` to check if `total_amount_val` is zero to prevent division by zero errors, returning `0.0` in that case. We multiply by `100.0` to ensure floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.
5.  **`result`**: Selects only the final required fields: `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `spm`.",25.35981726646424,"# Filter sell transactions from the last month (inclusive of 1 month ago)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a `month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting and sorting) and retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker`. It also selects the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices needed for later calculations.
2.  **`monthly_stats = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data first by `symbol` and then by `month`. Within each unique symbol-month group, it calculates:
    *   `avg_close`: The average of the `DailyPrices.close` values for that group.
    *   `max_high`: The maximum of the `DailyPrices.high` values for that group.
    *   `min_low`: The minimum of the `DailyPrices.low` values for that group.
    The result `monthly_stats` is a collection where each row represents a specific ticker for a specific month, along with its calculated statistics.
3.  **`result = monthly_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the `monthly_stats` and calculates the final required fields:
    *   It keeps `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`.
    *   **`prev_avg_close=PREV(...)`**: This is the core of the MoM calculation. The `PREV` window function looks at the previous row's `avg_close` value.
        *   `by=month.ASC()`: It orders the rows chronologically by `month` before looking back.
        *   `per=""symbol""`: Crucially, it does this calculation *independently for each symbol*. It only looks at the previous month *for the same ticker*.
        *   `default=None`: If there is no previous row (i.e., it's the first month of data for that ticker), it returns `None`.
    *   **`MoMC=IFF(...)`**: This calculates the Month-over-Month Change. It uses `IFF` to handle edge cases:
        *   It checks if `prev_avg_close` is not `None` (meaning a previous month exists) AND if `prev_avg_close` is not `0` (to prevent division by zero).
        *   If both conditions are true, it calculates `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
        *   Otherwise (first month or previous average was zero), it assigns `None` to `MoMC`.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted alphabetically by ticker symbol and then chronologically by month for easier reading.",39.18846154212952,"# Step 1: Prepare DailyPrices data by extracting month in 'YYYY-MM' format

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info`**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection and use `CALCULATE` to extract the `ticker_symbol` (via the `ticker` relationship), the `price_year`, and `price_month` from the `date`. We also keep the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices needed for later calculations.
2.  **`ticker_groups`**: We partition `price_info` by `ticker_symbol`. This creates groups, where each group contains all the price information for a single ticker.
3.  **`monthly_stats_per_ticker`**: Within each `ticker_group`, we access the associated `DailyPrices` again and partition them by `price_year` and `price_month`. Then, we `CALCULATE` the required monthly aggregates: `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low` for each month within that specific ticker's group.
4.  **`final_stats_with_prev`**: We take the `monthly_stats_per_ticker` results (which represent one row per ticker per month with aggregate values) and use `CALCULATE` again. Here, we apply the `PREV` window function to the `avg_close`. The `by=(price_year.ASC(), price_month.ASC())` argument ensures we look at the immediately preceding month *within the same ticker's data* (because this calculation happens within the `ticker_groups` context). `default=None` handles the first month for each ticker where there's no previous month.
5.  **`result`**: Finally, we access the `final_stats_with_prev` results through the `ticker_groups` partition (this allows us to easily retrieve the `ticker_symbol` associated with each group). We `CALCULATE` the final output fields:
    *   `ticker_symbol`: From the `ticker_groups` partition key.
    *   `month_str`: Created by joining the `price_year` and `price_month`.
    *   `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`: Carried over from the previous step.
    *   `momc`: Calculated using the formula `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`. The `IFF` function prevents division by zero or errors when `prev_avg_close` is null (e.g., for the first month of data for a ticker).",60.54852318763733,"# Step 1: Calculate necessary date components and retrieve ticker symbol for each daily price record.

    *   `price_change=...`: Calculates the difference between the maximum high price and the minimum low price found within the specified date range for that ticker's historical prices. The `WHERE` clause inside `MAX` and `MIN` ensures only prices from April 1st to April 4th, 2023, are considered for finding the overall highest high and lowest low during that period.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_month`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. In the first `CALCULATE`, we extract the `YEAR` and `MONTH` from the `join_date` for each customer and store them as `join_yr` and `join_mth`, respectively. We also select the customer's `_id` and `name`, renaming them to `cust_id` and `cust_name` for clarity.
2.  **`customer_transaction_counts`**: We take the result from the previous step. In the second `CALCULATE`, we access the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer. We use `WHERE` to filter these transactions, keeping only those where the `YEAR(date_time)` matches the customer's `join_yr` AND the `MONTH(date_time)` matches the customer's `join_mth`. We then use `COUNT()` on this filtered sub-collection to get the number of transactions made in the same month the customer joined, storing this count as `num_transactions_in_join_month`. We pass along `cust_id` and `cust_name`.
3.  **`top_customer`**: We apply `TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())` to the `customer_transaction_counts` collection. This sorts the customers in descending order based on their `num_transactions_in_join_month` and selects only the top one (the customer with the highest count).
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the `top_customer` result to select and rename the fields as requested: `_id` (from `cust_id`), `name` (from `cust_name`), and `num_transactions` (from `num_transactions_in_join_month`).",22.640258312225345,"# Calculate the join year and month for each customer

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_in_range = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those records where the `date_time` falls between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, inclusive. We use `>= ""2023-01-01""` for the start date and `< ""2023-04-01""` for the end date to correctly include all times on March 31st.
2.  **`grouped_by_type = transactions_in_range.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered transactions into groups based on the unique values in the `transaction_type` field. Each group represents a specific transaction type.
3.  **`type_metrics = grouped_by_type.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (transaction type) created by the partition, this calculates:
    *   `transaction_type=transaction_type`: Selects the transaction type (the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_customers=NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`: Counts the number of unique customer IDs within that transaction type group using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function on the `customer_id` field of the transactions belonging to the group.
    *   `average_shares=AVG(Transactions.shares)`: Calculates the average value of the `shares` field for all transactions within that group using the `AVG` aggregation function.
4.  **`top_3_transaction_types = type_metrics.TOP_K(...)`**: This takes the results from the previous step and selects the top 3 records based on the `num_distinct_customers` field, sorted in descending order (`DESC()`).
5.  **`result = top_3_transaction_types`**: The final result, containing the transaction type, distinct customer count, and average shares for the top 3 types, is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.037920236587524,"# Filter transactions to the specified date range (Q1 2023)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the state of the associated customer (`customer.state`) and the type of the associated ticker (`ticker.ticker_type`), assigning them to new fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`state_ticker_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition the `transaction_info` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups the transactions based on the unique combinations of the values in the `cust_state` and `tick_type` fields. Each group is named ""combinations"".
3.  **`combination_counts = state_ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` again. We select the partitioning keys (`cust_state` and `tick_type`, renaming them to `customer_state` and `ticker_type` for the final output) and calculate the total number of transactions within that specific group using `COUNT(Transactions)`. This gives us the count for each unique state-ticker type combination.
4.  **`top_5_combinations = combination_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())` to select the 5 combinations with the highest `num_transactions`, sorting them in descending order based on the transaction count.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`q1_successful_transactions`**: This variable filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Selects transactions only from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters these transactions to include only those from January (1), February (2), or March (3), representing the first quarter.
    *   `status == 'Completed'`: Filters for transactions marked as 'Completed'. We assume 'Completed' represents a successful transaction status as the schema doesn't explicitly define success values.
2.  **`transactions_with_month`**: This takes the filtered transactions and adds a new calculated field `transaction_month`.
    *   `JOIN_STRINGS('-', YEAR(date_time), LPAD(MONTH(date_time), 2, '0'))`: Creates a string in the format 'YYYY-MM' (e.g., '2023-01') by combining the year and the zero-padded month number. `LPAD` ensures months like January become '01'.
3.  **`monthly_average_prices`**: This performs the main aggregation.
    *   `.PARTITION(name='monthly_groups', by=(transaction_month))`: Groups the transactions based on the `transaction_month` field calculated previously.
    *   `.CALCULATE(month=transaction_month, average_transaction_price=AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each monthly group created by the partition, it calculates:
        *   `month`: The month identifier ('YYYY-MM').
        *   `average_transaction_price`: The average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to that specific month's group. It accesses the `price` from the original `Transactions` collection context within the partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result chronologically by month.",18.54976320266724,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 and 'Completed' status

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We first establish the time frame using `DATETIME`. `start_of_current_week` gets the date of the Monday (or configured start day) of the current week. `start_of_period` calculates the date 8 weeks prior to `start_of_current_week`.
2.  **Filter Relevant Payments:**
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection and filter for sales where `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   We access the associated payments using `.payment`.
    *   We then filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and strictly before `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting payments from the last 8 full calendar weeks.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping:**
    *   We use `CALCULATE` on the filtered payments (`relevant_payments`) to determine the start date of the week each payment belongs to using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')` and store it as `payment_week_start`.
    *   We also create a boolean flag `is_weekend` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` to easily identify weekend payments later.
4.  **Group by Week:**
    *   We use `PARTITION` on `payments_info` to group the records by the calculated `payment_week_start`. Each group in `weekly_groups` represents a unique week within our 8-week timeframe.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates:**
    *   We apply `CALCULATE` to the `weekly_groups`.
    *   `week=payment_week_start`: We select the partition key, renaming it to `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: For each week's group, we count all the associated `PaymentsReceived` records to get the total count for that week.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.is_weekend)`: For each week's group, we sum the `is_weekend` flag (where True is treated as 1 and False as 0). This efficiently counts the payments that occurred on a weekend within that group.
6.  **Order Results:**
    *   Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the weekly summaries by the week start date in ascending order.
7.  **Assign to Variable:** The final result is assigned to the `final_result` variable.",32.55540370941162,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week period before it

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first establish the time frame.
    *   `end_of_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Calculates the date of the beginning of the current week. Payments *before* this date are included.
    *   `start_of_period = DATETIME(..., '-8 weeks')`: Calculates the date 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week. Payments on or *after* this date are included. This defines the start of our 8-week window.
2.  **`filtered_payments = time_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `time_boundaries` context (which makes `start_of_period` and `end_of_period` available).
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these payments:
        *   `payment_date >= start_of_period`: Ensures the payment is within the last 8 weeks.
        *   `payment_date < end_of_period`: Excludes payments from the current week.
        *   `sale_record.sale_price > 30000`: Filters for payments linked to sales exceeding $30,000 by accessing the related `sale_record`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered payments, we calculate:
    *   `week_start_date = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the calendar week for each payment. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_payment = ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Creates a boolean flag indicating if the payment occurred on a weekend.
4.  **`weekly_payment_groups = filtered_payments.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_payments` data.
    *   `name=""weekly_groups"", by=(week_start_date)`: Groups the payments based on the calculated `week_start_date`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each weekly group (partition), we calculate:
    *   `week_date = week_start_date`: Selects the week's starting date for the output.
    *   `total_payments_received = COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts all payments belonging to that specific week group.
    *   `weekend_payments_received = COUNT(PaymentsReceived.WHERE(is_weekend_payment == True))`: Counts only the payments within that group where the pre-calculated `is_weekend_payment` flag is true.

    *   We access the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson, which contains their sales records.
    *   We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these sales.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 29`**: This condition calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date (`'now'`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%'))`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it.
    *   `UPPER(vin_number)` converts the `vin_number` field to uppercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%M5%')` checks if the uppercase VIN contains the substring 'M5'.
    *   The result is a collection of cars whose VIN contains 'M5'.
2.  **`model_sales_groups = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`**: This partitions the filtered cars (`cars_with_m5_vin`) into groups based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group is named `model_group`.
3.  **`sales_per_model = model_sales_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition group created in the previous step.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`toyota_sales_last_30_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these sales based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider cars that have been sold at least once.
    *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1).SINGULAR().is_in_inventory == False`: This is a more complex condition to check the latest inventory status.
        *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)`: We look into the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`: We rank the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order. `== 1` selects the most recent snapshot.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking filter ensures only one snapshot (the latest) is selected per car, `SINGULAR()` allows us to treat it as a single record.
        *   `.is_in_inventory == False`: We check if the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot is `False`, meaning the car is not currently in inventory according to the latest record.
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions, so `filtered_cars` contains only cars that have been sold *and* are confirmed not in inventory based on their latest snapshot.
2.  **`make_model_groups = filtered_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_cars` collection.
    *   `name=""make_model_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition context.
    *   `by=(make, model)`: Groups the cars based on their unique combination of `make` and `model`.
3.  **`max_prices_per_group = make_model_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we calculate the required information.
    *   `make=make, model=model`: We include the make and model, which are the partitioning keys.
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: We calculate the maximum `sale_price` found within the `sale_records` of all `Cars` belonging to the current `make_model_group`.
4.  **`result = max_prices_per_group.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the results based on the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first).",36.731961250305176,"# Step 1: Filter cars that have been sold and whose latest inventory snapshot indicates they are not in inventory.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_sales_info = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection. The `WHERE` clause filters these sales based on the status of the associated car (`car`).
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This checks if the car associated with the sale has at least one inventory snapshot meeting the inner `WHERE` conditions.
3.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC()) == 1`**: Inside the inner `WHERE`, this ranks the `inventory_snapshots` for the *specific car* of the current sale record based on `snapshot_date` in descending order. Rank 1 represents the most recent snapshot.
4.  **`is_in_inventory == False`**: This condition checks if the latest snapshot (rank 1) indicates the car is *not* in inventory.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(car_make=car.make, car_model=car.model, sale_price_val=sale_price)`**: After filtering, we extract the `make` and `model` from the associated `car` and the `sale_price` from the `Sales` record itself. These are needed for the subsequent partitioning and aggregation.
6.  **`filtered_sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered sales data (`filtered_sales_info`) into groups based on the unique combinations of `car_make` and `car_model`.
7.  **`.CALCULATE(make=car_make, model=car_model, highest_sale_price=MAX(filtered_sales_info.sale_price_val))`**: For each partition group (each make/model combination), we calculate the final output fields: `make`, `model`, and `highest_sale_price`. `MAX(filtered_sales_info.sale_price_val)` computes the maximum `sale_price_val` among all sales records within that specific make/model group.
8.  **`.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting make/model groups based on their calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first).",35.33805704116821,"# Step 1: Filter sales records. We only want sales where the associated car's

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`**: This condition filters for cars where the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity. The `|` operator represents the logical OR.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select and compute the desired output fields.
4.  **`car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year, car_color=color, car_vin=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields from the filtered cars and assign them to new names (`car_make`, `car_model`, etc.) for clarity.
5.  **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which contains all sales associated with the car) and applies the `AVG` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field within those records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it based on the specified criteria.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains the substring 'ford'. The `LIKE` function with '%' wildcards allows for partial matching, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains the substring 'mustang'.
    *   **`|`**: The OR operator combines the two conditions, so cars matching either the make or model criteria are included.
2.  **`result = filtered_cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the filtered cars and calculates the desired output fields.
    *   **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These select the standard car details directly from the filtered `Cars` records.
    *   **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to the `Sales` collection) and computes the average of the `sale_price` field within those linked sales records.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info`**: Calculates the start date of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the start date of the month 6 months prior (`six_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function. This defines the time window for filtering sales.
2.  **`relevant_salespersons`**: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
3.  **`sales_in_period`**:
    *   Accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection from the `relevant_salespersons`.
    *   Filters these sales using `WHERE` to include only those with a `sale_date` within the calculated 6-month window (greater than or equal to `six_months_ago_start` and less than `current_month_start`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month_str` field by formatting the `sale_date` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting). It also passes the `sale_price` through for later aggregation.
4.  **`monthly_sales_groups`**: Partitions the `sales_in_period` data based on the `sale_month_str`, grouping all sales from the same month together.
5.  **`monthly_metrics`**:
    *   Operates on the results of the partition.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to output the `sale_month` (renamed from `sale_month_str`).
    *   Calculates `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) by counting the number of `Sales` records within each month's partition group using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   Calculates `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) by summing the `sale_price` of the `Sales` records within each month's partition group using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
    *   Uses `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` to sort the final results chronologically by month.
6.  **`result = monthly_metrics`**: Assigns the final calculated and ordered monthly metrics to the `result` variable.

*Note*: This query calculates metrics for months within the specified range *that have sales data* matching the criteria. If a month within the last 6 months had zero sales from the selected salespersons, it will not appear in the output, as the `PARTITION` step only creates groups for existing `sale_month_str` values.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Date Range:**
    *   We first establish the time window using `Dealership.CALCULATE`.
    *   `current_month_start` gets the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_date_filter` calculates the date 6 months prior to `current_month_start` using `DATETIME(current_month_start, '-6 months')`.
    *   `end_date_filter` is set to `current_month_start`, making the range exclusive of the current month.
2.  **Filter Sales Data:**
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection, accessed via `date_calc.Sales` to bring the date filters into scope.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters sales records based on two criteria:
        *   The `sale_date` must be within the calculated range (`>= start_date_filter` and `< end_date_filter`).
        *   The associated salesperson (`Sales.salesperson`) must have a `hire_date` within the years 2022 or 2023 (`YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) >= 2022 & YEAR(salesperson.hire_date) <= 2023`).
    *   A `CALCULATE` step then prepares the data for partitioning:
        *   It creates `sale_month` by combining the year and month (padded with `LPAD` for correct YYYY-MM format) of the `sale_date`.
        *   It retains the `sale_price` needed for the revenue calculation.
3.  **Partition and Aggregate:**
    *   The `PARTITION` function groups the `filtered_sales_info` by the calculated `sale_month`.
    *   Inside the final `CALCULATE` applied to these monthly partitions:
        *   `sale_month` is selected.
        *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) is calculated using `COUNT(Sales)`, counting the sales records within each month's group.
        *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`, summing the sale prices within each group.
4.  **Order Results:**
    *   `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` sorts the final results chronologically by month.
5.  **Final Assignment:**

2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each sale, it checks if the associated car (`car`) has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) inventory snapshot (`inventory_snapshots`) that meets the criteria specified in the inner `WHERE`.
3.  **`inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))`**: This inner filter selects inventory snapshots for the car where `is_in_inventory` is `False` (meaning the car went out of inventory) AND the `snapshot_date` of that inventory record matches the `sale_date` of the current sale being evaluated.
4.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`**: After filtering to get only sales that occurred on the day the car left inventory, this selects the single sale (`1`) with the highest `sale_price` (ordered `DESC`endingly).
5.  **`.CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)`**: Finally, for the top sale found, this selects the `make` and `model` from the related car record (`car.make`, `car.model`) and the `sale_price` from the sale record itself.",20.22443437576294,"highest_priced_sale_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, it creates a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., ""2023-05"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure the month part is always two digits). It also keeps the `payment_amount`.
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `payment_info` data based on the calculated `payment_month_str`. For each unique month string, it creates a group.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(month_str=..., total_payments=SUM(...))`**: Within each monthly partition, this calculates the total sum of `payment_amount` for all payments received in that specific month. It accesses the original `PaymentsReceived` collection context within the `SUM` aggregation as per standard `PARTITION` usage.
4.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the aggregated monthly totals.
    *   It selects the `month` (renamed from `month_str`) and the `total_monthly_payments`.
    *   It calculates the `mom_change` using the `PREV` window function. `PREV(total_payments, by=month_str.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_payments` from the *previous* record when ordered by `month_str` ascending. The `default=0.0` ensures that for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the previous value is treated as 0, preventing errors or null results in the MoM calculation for that first month. The MoM change is then calculated as the current month's total minus this previous month's total.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted chronologically by month.

*Note*: This query calculates the total payments and MoM change *only for months where payments were received*.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   It creates a `year_month_str` field by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `payment_date`, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". This string format ensures correct chronological sorting later.
    *   It retains the `payment_amount` for summation.
2.  **`monthly_groups = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions (groups) the `payment_info` data based on the unique `year_month_str` values.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(year_month_str=..., total_monthly_payments=SUM(...))`**: Within each monthly partition (`months`), this calculates:
    *   `year_month_str`: Keeps the month identifier.
    *   `total_monthly_payments`: Sums the `payment_amount` for all `PaymentsReceived` records belonging to that specific month group.
4.  **`ordered_monthly_totals = monthly_groups.ORDER_BY(...)`**: This sorts the aggregated monthly results chronologically based on the `year_month_str`. Ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function to work correctly.
5.  **`result = ordered_monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step calculates the Month-over-Month (MoM) change:
    *   `month_identifier`: Selects the ""YYYY-MM"" string.
    *   `total_payments`: Selects the calculated total payments for the month.
    *   `mom_change`: Calculates the difference between the `total_monthly_payments` of the current month and the `total_monthly_payments` of the *previous* month.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=year_month_str.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_monthly_payments` from the preceding record in the ordered set.
        *   `by=year_month_str.ASC()` ensures `PREV` uses the same chronological order established earlier.
        *   `default=0.0` provides a value (0.0) for the `PREV` function when applied to the very first record (which has no preceding record), preventing errors and resulting in the MoM change for the first month being equal to its total payments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. Inside the first `CALCULATE`, we:
    *   Select the salesperson's `_id` (renamed to `salesperson_id`), `first_name`, and `last_name`.
    *   Calculate `total_sales_amount` by summing the `sale_price` from all associated sales records found in the `sales_made` sub-collection. `SUM` is used because `sales_made` represents a one-to-many relationship (one salesperson can have many sales).
2.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last'))`**: This selects the top 5 salespersons based on the `total_sales_amount` calculated in the previous step.
    *   `5`: Specifies the number of top records to retrieve.
    *   `by=total_sales_amount.DESC(na_pos='last')`: Sorts the salespersons by `total_sales_amount` in descending order (highest sales first) and ensures any potential NULL values are placed last.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The final `CALCULATE` selects the required fields (`salesperson_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`) from the top 5 results for the final output.",12.740403175354004,"# Calculate total sales amount for each salesperson and select the top 5

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_sales_condition`**: This defines a reusable condition to filter sales that occurred within the last 30 days from today using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`.
2.  **`salesperson_performance`**:
    *   Starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute metrics for each salesperson.
    *   `s_first_name`, `s_last_name`: Selects the first and last names.
    *   `recent_sales_count`: Counts the sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`) but only includes those matching the `recent_sales_condition`.
    *   `recent_revenue_total`: Sums the `sale_price` of the sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`), again only including those matching the `recent_sales_condition`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no recent sales (resulting in a null sum), we output 0.0 instead.
3.  **`top_performers`**:
    *   Takes the `salesperson_performance` results.
    *   Uses `WHERE(recent_sales_count > 0)` to filter out salespersons with no sales in the specified period.
    *   Uses `TOP_K(5, by=recent_sales_count.DESC())` to select the top 5 salespersons based on the number of recent sales in descending order.
4.  **`result`**:
    *   Takes the `top_performers`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to select and rename the final fields as requested: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_count`, and `total_revenue_amount`.",24.55579662322998,"# Define the condition for sales within the last 30 days

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_stats = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`sales_last_30_days=sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the first `CALCULATE`, we create an intermediate representation `sales_last_30_days` by filtering the `sales_made` subcollection for each salesperson. The filter keeps only sales where the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the intermediate `sales_last_30_days`.
    *   **`recent_sales_count=COUNT(sales_last_30_days)`**: Counts the number of sales records within the filtered `sales_last_30_days` for each salesperson.
    *   **`recent_revenue_amount=SUM(sales_last_30_days.sale_price)`**: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales within the filtered `sales_last_30_days`.
4.  **`top_salespersons = salesperson_stats.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the results to include only salespersons who actually made sales in the last 30 days (`recent_sales_count > 0`).
5.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=recent_sales_count.DESC())`**: We select the top 5 salespersons based on the `recent_sales_count` in descending order.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the fields to match the requested output: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_count`, and `total_revenue_amount`. `DEFAULT_TO` is used on revenue as a safeguard, ensuring a numeric value even if edge cases resulted in null (though the `WHERE` clause should prevent this).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Sales` collection. For each sale record, it calculates three new fields:
    *   `customer_state`: Retrieves the state from the associated customer record (`Sales.customer.state`).
    *   `sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price` from the sale record.
    *   `customer_key`: Retrieves the unique identifier (`_id`) from the associated customer record (`Sales.customer._id`). This is needed later to count unique customers.
2.  **`state_aggregates = sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This step takes the `sales_info` data and partitions (groups) it based on the `customer_state`.
    *   `name=""state_sales""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(customer_state)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `customer_state` calculated in the previous step.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this `CALCULATE` operates on each state group:
    *   `state=customer_state`: Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer_key)`: Calculates the number of distinct `customer_key` values within the sales records belonging to the current state partition. This gives the count of unique customers for that state.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records within the current state partition. This gives the total revenue for that state.
4.  **`top_5_states_by_revenue = state_aggregates.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This step takes the aggregated results for each state and selects the top 5 based on the `total_revenue`, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC()`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.PARTITION(name=""car_models"", by=(make, model))`**: This groups all records in the `Cars` collection based on unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group represents a specific car model.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`, `car_model=model`: Selects the make and model from the partition keys.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: For each car model group, it counts the total number of associated sales records by accessing the `sale_records` sub-collection linked to the cars within that group.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: For each car model group, it calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` from all associated `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""state_groups"", by=state)`**: This groups the `Customers` collection by the `state` field. Each group represents a unique state and contains all customers from that state. The group is temporarily named `state_groups`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(state=state, total_signups=COUNT(Customers))`**: For each state group created by the `PARTITION`, this calculates two fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This line defines the start date for our analysis period. It calculates the date exactly 3 months prior to the current date and time using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it. The `HAS(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider salespersons who have made at least one sale (`sales_made`) on or after the calculated `start_date_3_months_ago`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required information:
    *   `rep_first_name=first_name`, `rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`: Counts the number of sales records associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`) that fall within the specified date range.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` for all sales made by the salesperson within the specified date range.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This defines the beginning of the time window. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `'-3 months'` subtracts 3 months from it.
2.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those who have made at least one sale on or after the `start_date`. The `HAS(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date)) == 1` condition achieves this by checking if the sub-collection of sales within the date range is not empty.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each salesperson who passed the filter, we calculate:
    *   `rep_first_name=first_name`: Selects the salesperson's first name.
    *   `rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date).sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` of only those sales (`sales_made`) that occurred within the specified 3-month period (`WHERE(sale_date >= start_date)`).
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date))`: Counts the number of sales made by the salesperson within the same 3-month period.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 salespersons from the calculated results, ordering them in descending order based on their `total_revenue`.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Creates new fields for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `salesperson_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Concatenates the `first_name` and `last_name` fields with a space in between to create a full name.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`salesperson_employment_duration = Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to compute the `employment_days` for each salesperson by finding the difference between their `termination_date` and `hire_date` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", ...)`. We also select the first name, last name, and phone number, renaming them temporarily (`sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`, `sp_phone`) to avoid potential naming conflicts.
2.  **`.WHERE(employment_days != None)`**: We filter the results to include only those salespersons for whom the `employment_days` calculation is valid (i.e., they have a non-null `termination_date`). `DATEDIFF` would likely return null if `termination_date` is null, so this effectively filters for terminated employees.
3.  **`shortest_employment_salesperson = salesperson_employment_duration.TOP_K(1, by=employment_days.ASC())`**: We use `TOP_K(1, ...)` on the filtered results to find the single record (`k=1`) with the minimum (`ASC()`) value for `employment_days`.
4.  **`result = shortest_employment_salesperson.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the resulting single record to format the output as requested: combining the first and last names into `salesperson_name` using `JOIN_STRINGS`, selecting the `phone_number`, and the calculated `days_employed`.",22.777405977249146,"# Calculate the employment duration in days for each salesperson who has a termination date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`weekend_utility_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `PaymentsMade` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these payments based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `vendor_name == 'Utility Company'`: Selects payments where the `vendor_name` field is exactly 'Utility Company'.
    *   `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This checks if the day of the week for the `payment_date` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". `DAYNAME()` extracts the day name from the date, and `ISIN()` checks if that name is present in the provided tuple `(""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")`.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result at the top `Dealership` level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Dealership` collection.
    *   `start_curr_iso_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the start date (Monday) of the current week based on the current timestamp (`'now'`). We assume the system's week start is configured to Monday for ISO week compatibility.
    *   `start_prev_iso_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Calculates the start date (Monday) of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
2.  **`payments_last_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_prev_iso_week` and `start_curr_iso_week` available) and filter the payments. The `WHERE` clause selects payments whose `payment_date` is on or after the start of the previous week (`>= start_prev_iso_week`) and *before* the start of the current week (`< start_curr_iso_week`), effectively capturing all moments within the previous full ISO week.
3.  **`payments_info = payments_last_week.CALCULATE(...)`**: We prepare the filtered data for partitioning.
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field `payment_day` by truncating the original `payment_date` to midnight. This ensures all payments on the same calendar day are grouped together, regardless of the time.
    *   `pay_method=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` field, renaming it slightly for clarity within the partition step.
4.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `payments_info` collection.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_day, pay_method)`: Groups the records based on the unique combinations of the truncated payment day and the payment method.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group.
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the day (which is a partition key).
    *   `payment_method=pay_method`: Selects the payment method (the other partition key).
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific `payment_day` and `pay_method` group. We refer back to the original collection (`PaymentsReceived`) within the context of the partition group to perform the aggregation.
6.  **`result = daily_totals_by_method.ORDER_BY(...)`**: The final result is assigned to the `result` variable, and `ORDER_BY` is used to sort the output first by date (ascending) and then by payment method (ascending) for better readability.",31.07422089576721,"# Calculate the start date of the current ISO week (Monday) and the start date of the previous ISO week.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary date boundaries at the top level.
    *   `start_of_current_week_ts = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the exact timestamp when the current ISO week started (e.g., the most recent Monday at 00:00:00, depending on system configuration for the start of the week).
    *   `start_of_previous_week_date = DATETIME(..., '-7 days', 'start of day')`: Takes the start of the current week, subtracts 7 days to get to the start of the previous week, and truncates it to the beginning of that day (00:00:00).
    *   `end_of_previous_week_date = DATETIME(..., '-1 day', 'start of day')`: Takes the start of the current week, subtracts 1 day to get the last day of the previous week, and truncates it to the beginning of that day (00:00:00). We will use `<=` later, so this correctly includes the entire last day.

2.  **`payments_in_prev_week = time_info.PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This accesses the `PaymentsReceived` collection via the `time_info` context (which contains the calculated dates).
    *   `payment_day = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: For each payment, it extracts just the date part (setting the time to 00:00:00) for accurate daily grouping and comparison.
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: Filters these payments to include only those where `payment_day` falls on or between the calculated `start_of_previous_week_date` and `end_of_previous_week_date`.

3.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_in_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: This groups the filtered payments.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups"", by=(payment_day, payment_method)`: Creates partitions (groups) based on unique combinations of the payment day and the payment method.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Calculates results for each group.
        *   `payment_date_result = payment_day`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_result = payment_method`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount = SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all `PaymentsReceived` records belonging to the current partition (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, it calculates:
    *   `cust_state`: The state of the customer associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
    *   `quarter_number`: The quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4) derived from the `sale_date` using integer division `(MONTH(sale_date) + 2) // 3`.
    *   `sale_price`: Retains the `sale_price` for later aggregation.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_groups"", by=(cust_state, quarter_number))`**: Groups the `sales_info_2023` records based on unique combinations of customer state (`cust_state`) and quarter number (`quarter_number`).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   It selects the `state` and `q_num` (the partition keys).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter group. Note that `SUM` operates on the original `Sales` collection's context within the partition group.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after aggregation**: Takes the aggregated results and formats the output:
    *   `customer_state=state`: Renames `state` to `customer_state`.
    *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: Converts the numeric quarter (`q_num`) into the corresponding quarter start date string (e.g., 1 becomes '2023-01-01').

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  **`sales_with_quarter_info = sales_2023.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates necessary intermediate values for each sale in 2023:
    *   `s_price=sale_price`: Stores the sale price.
    *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state from the linked `customer` record.
    *   `sale_month=MONTH(sale_date)`: Extracts the month number (1-12).
    *   `month_start=DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of month')`: Calculates the first day of the month the sale occurred in.
    *   `q_start_date=IFF(...)`: Calculates the first day of the quarter. It uses nested `IFF` and `ISIN` functions:
        *   If the month is the first month of a quarter (1, 4, 7, 10), the `month_start` is the `q_start_date`.
        *   If the month is the second month of a quarter (2, 5, 8, 11), it subtracts 1 month from `month_start`.
        *   If the month is the third month of a quarter (3, 6, 9, 12), it subtracts 2 months from `month_start`.
3.  **`partitioned_sales = sales_with_quarter_info.PARTITION(...)`**: Groups the results from the previous step.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(cust_state, q_start_date)`: Specifies that grouping should be done based on the unique combinations of customer state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  **`quarterly_sales_by_state = partitioned_sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: Performs calculations on each group created by the partition.
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the customer state (from the partition key).
    *   `quarter_start=q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date (from the partition key).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter group by referring back to the original `Sales` collection context within the partition.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(customer_state.ASC(), quarter_start.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first by customer state alphabetically and then by the quarter start date chronologically.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Valid Treatments:** We start by accessing the `Treatments` collection. We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter only those treatments that have a non-null `end_dt` (`HAS(end_dt) == 1`) and where the duration between `start_dt` and `end_dt` is greater than 0 days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`). This prevents division by zero and adheres to the DDD definition requirement.
2.  **Calculate DDD per Treatment (Implicit within AVG):** Inside the main `CALCULATE` on `Drugs`, the `AVG` function operates on the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug. Within the `AVG`, we re-apply the same filters (`WHERE(...)`) to ensure we only consider valid treatments for that specific drug. Then, we use an inner `CALCULATE` to compute the `ddd_val` (which is `tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`) for each of these valid treatments.
3.  **Group by Drug and Average:** The `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)` structure effectively groups the results by drug. The `AVG(...)` function then calculates the average of the `ddd_val` computed in the previous step across all valid treatments associated *with that specific drug*.
4.  **Filter Drugs:** An outer `WHERE` clause is applied to the `Drugs` collection (`Drugs.WHERE(HAS(...) == 1)`) to ensure that we only include drugs that have at least one treatment meeting the validity criteria (non-null `end_dt` and duration > 0). This avoids calculating averages for drugs with no relevant treatment data.
5.  **Select Output Fields:** The final `CALCULATE` selects the `drug_name` and the calculated `average_ddd` for each qualifying drug.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final query result is assigned to the variable `result`.",32.72743105888367,"# Calculate DDD for each valid treatment first

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatment_ddd_calc`**:
    *   Starts with the `DermTreatment.Treatments` collection.
    *   Filters treatments using `WHERE` to include only those where:
        *   `end_dt` is not null (`HAS(end_dt) == 1`).
        *   The treatment duration (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`) is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero or negative durations.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute:
        *   `drug_key`: Extracts the `drug_id` from the related `drug` record to use for grouping later.
        *   `ddd_value`: Calculates the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each valid treatment according to the definition (`tot_drug_amt` / duration in days).

2.  **`avg_ddd_per_drug`**:
    *   Takes the `treatment_ddd_calc` collection (which contains individual DDD values per treatment linked to a drug key).
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group these records by `drug_key`. Each partition (`drug_group`) contains all DDD calculations for a specific drug.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   `drug_name`: Retrieves the actual `drug_name` by looking up the `drug_key` in the main `DermTreatment.Drugs` collection. `SINGULAR()` is used assuming each `drug_key` corresponds to exactly one drug record.
        *   `average_ddd`: Calculates the average of the `ddd_value` within each `drug_group` using the `AVG` aggregation function.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the start date of the current month (`start_current_month`) and the start date of the period 3 months prior (`start_period`) using the `DATETIME` function relative to 'now'. This defines the time window for our analysis (the last three full calendar months).
2.  **`treatment_info`**: We access the `Treatments` collection through `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates). We filter treatments whose `start_dt` falls within our calculated period (`>= start_period` and `< start_current_month`). For these treatments, we calculate:
    *   `treatment_month`: The year and month of the treatment start date, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"".
    *   `patient_key`: The `patient_id` associated with the treatment.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag indicating if the treatment used a drug with `drug_type` equal to 'biologic'.
3.  **`monthly_patient_counts`**: We partition the `treatment_info` data by the calculated `treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that started in the same month.
4.  **`CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`**: For each monthly group (`monthly_groups`):
    *   We select the `month` (which is the partition key `treatment_month`).
    *   `patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct `patient_key` values within that month's group using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)`. This gives the total unique patients treated in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: We calculate the number of distinct `patient_key` values *only for treatments where `is_biologic_treatment` is True* within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment == True).patient_key)`. This gives the unique patients receiving biologic treatments in that month.
5.  **`ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: The results are sorted chronologically by month.
6.  **`result = monthly_patient_counts`**: The final calculated data is assigned to the `result` variable.",34.03161025047302,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 3 full months, excluding the current month

2.  **Filter Treatments**: Select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Extract Key Information**: For each of these filtered treatments, we'll calculate:
    *   A `treatment_ym_label` (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") from the `start_dt` for grouping by month.
    *   The `p_id` (patient identifier) from the related `patient` record.
    *   An `is_biologic_drug` flag, which is true if the `drug_type` of the related `drug` record is 'biologic'.
4.  **Group by Month**: We then partition (group) these treatments based on the `treatment_ym_label`.
5.  **Calculate Distinct Patient Counts**: For each monthly group:
    *   `patient_count`: Count the number of distinct `p_id`s.
    *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count`: Count the number of distinct `p_id`s for treatments where `is_biologic_drug` is true.

**Explanation:**

1.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of patients).
2.  `num_patients = COUNT(...)`: This defines the output field `num_patients` which will hold the count of patients meeting the criteria.
3.  `Patients.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it.
4.  `HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This is the main filtering condition for patients.
    *   `treatments_received`: This accesses the list of treatments for each patient.
    *   `.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))`: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the treatments. It checks two conditions:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris'`: The name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment must be 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
        *   `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`: The type of the drug used in the treatment must be 'biologic'.
        *   The `&` operator ensures both conditions must be true for a treatment to be considered.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one treatment (for the current patient) that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause conditions. If a patient has one or more such treatments, `HAS` returns true (1).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as we want to retrieve information about adverse events.
2.  **`.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == 'topical')`**: We filter these events. For each adverse event, we navigate through its singular relationship `treatment` to the corresponding `Treatments` record, then through the treatment's singular relationship `drug` to the corresponding `Drugs` record. We check if the `drug_type` field of this drug is equal to 'topical'. Only adverse events linked to treatments using topical drugs are kept.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select and rename the desired fields for the filtered adverse events:
    *   `event_description=description`: Selects the `description` field from the `AdverseEvents` record.
    *   `treatment_identifier=treatment.treatment_id`: Selects the `treatment_id` from the related `Treatments` record via the `treatment` relationship.
    *   `drug_identifier=treatment.drug.drug_id`: Selects the `drug_id` from the related `Drugs` record by navigating through `treatment` and then `drug`.
    *   `drug_name_field=treatment.drug.drug_name`: Selects the `drug_name` from the related `Drugs` record, also navigating through `treatment` and `drug`.
4.  **`topical_drug_adverse_events = ...`**: The final result, containing the specified details for adverse events related to topical drug treatments, is assigned to the variable `topical_drug_adverse_events`.",16.645999908447266,"topical_drug_adverse_events = AdverseEvents.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == 'topical').CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as we are interested in adverse event details.
2.  Filter these adverse events. An adverse event is linked to a `treatment`. This `treatment` is, in turn, linked to a `drug`. We need to check if the `drug_type` of this associated drug is 'TOPICAL'.
3.  For the adverse events that satisfy this condition, select the required fields:
    *   `description` from the `AdverseEvents` record.
    *   `treatment_id` from the `AdverseEvents` record.
    *   `drug_id` from the associated `drug` record of the treatment.
    *   `drug_name` from the associated `drug` record of the treatment.

The PyDough code will use a `WHERE` clause to filter based on `treatment.drug.drug_type == 'TOPICAL'` and a `CALCULATE` clause to select and name the desired output fields.

1.  Calculate relevant metrics for each doctor: `doc_id`, their `speciality`, and the `num_distinct_drugs` they have prescribed. The number of distinct drugs is found by looking at all treatments prescribed by a doctor, then the drug associated with each treatment, and finally counting the unique drug IDs.
2.  Partition the doctors based on their `speciality`. This creates groups, where each group contains doctors of the same specialty. This step is necessary for the subsequent ranking within each specialty.
3.  For each doctor within their specialty group, calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`). The rank is determined by the `num_distinct_drugs` (more drugs mean a rank closer to 1). The `RANKING` function's `per` argument refers to the partition group created in step 2, ensuring ranking is performed independently for each specialty.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: Calculates the start date of the current month and the start date of the month 12 months prior using `DATETIME` functions. This defines the time window for analysis.
2.  **`filtered_treatments`**:
    *   Starts with the `Treatments` collection accessed via `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates).
    *   Filters treatments using `WHERE` to include only those with a `start_dt` within the calculated 12-month window (greater than or equal to 12 months ago start, and less than the current month start).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `treatment_year` and `treatment_month` from `start_dt`.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first establish the 12-month period of interest. This period starts 12 months before the beginning of the current month and ends just before the current month begins. We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the first day of the current month, and then adjust it to define our window.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this calculated 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each filtered treatment, we create a standardized year-month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") from its `start_dt`. This string will be used for grouping, effectively truncating the `start_dt` to the month.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the treatments based on the generated year-month string.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each month, we count the number of unique patients (`patient_id`) who received a treatment. This interprets ""patient diagnoses"" as the count of distinct patients involved in treatments (and thus associated diagnoses) during that month.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each month, we count the total number of treatments.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered chronologically by the year-month string.
7.  **Select Output Fields**: The final output will include the year-month string, PMPD, and PMTC.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`new_patient_info`**: This step filters the `Patients` collection to include only those who have received at least one treatment (`WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`). For each of these patients, it calculates the year of their earliest treatment start date using `YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt))` and assigns it to `first_treatment_year`.
2.  **`yearly_new_patients_count`**: This step takes the `new_patient_info` and partitions it by the `first_treatment_year`. For each year group, it calculates the `year` (which is the partition key) and the count of patients within that group (`num_new_patients=COUNT(Patients)`). The result is then ordered by year in ascending order, which is essential for the next step using the `PREV` function.
3.  **`npi_calculation`**: This step takes the yearly counts and calculates the New Patient Increase (`npi`). It does this by subtracting the number of new patients from the *previous* year (`PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's count (`num_new_patients`). The `PREV` function looks back one record based on the specified ordering (`by=year.ASC()`), and `default=0` handles the first year where there is no previous year.
4.  **`result = npi_calculation`**: The final calculated data including the year, number of new patients for that year, and the NPI compared to the previous year is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.082088232040405,"# Step 1: For each patient with treatments, find the year of their first treatment start date

A new patient is defined as a patient starting their first treatment. We then count these new patients per year and calculate the year-over-year increase.

Here's the step-by-step PyDough code:

1.  **Determine the Year Each Patient Became ""New""**:
    For each patient, find the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` of all their `treatments_received`. The year of this date is when they are considered a ""new patient"". We only consider patients who have received at least one treatment.

2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**:
    Group the information from step 1 by the ""new patient year"" and count the number of unique patients in each year. This gives the total number of new patients for each year. The result is ordered by year to facilitate the next step.

3.  **Calculate NPI**:
    For each year, calculate the NPI as the difference between the number of new patients in the current year and the number of new patients in the previous year. For the earliest year in the dataset, NPI will be `None` as there's no preceding year for comparison.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_details`:
    *   Starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`: Filters out patients who have never received any treatment.
    *   `CALCULATE(year_became_new=YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))`: For each remaining patient, it finds the minimum `start_dt` from their `treatments_received` (i.e., their first treatment date) and extracts the year. This year is stored as `year_became_new`.

2.  `annual_new_patient_counts`:
    *   Takes `patient_first_treatment_details`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""new_patients_annual_group"", by=year_became_new)`: Groups the patients by the `year_became_new`.
    *   `CALCULATE(year=year_became_new, number_of_new_patients=COUNT(Patients))`: For each group (i.e., for each year), it outputs the `year` and counts the number of distinct patients (`COUNT(Patients)`) who became new in that year, naming it `number_of_new_patients`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC())`: Sorts the results by year in ascending order, which is crucial for the `PREV` function to work correctly.

3.  `npi_results`:
    *   Takes `annual_new_patient_counts`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`valid_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. The condition `(field == field)` is a common way to check for non-null values when an explicit `IS NOT NULL` function isn't available or standard.
2.  **`overall_pasi_improvement = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This starts a calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`) because we need a single, overall result.
3.  **`avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(valid_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`**: Calculates the average `day7_pasi_score` using only the records stored in the `valid_outcomes` collection.
4.  **`avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(valid_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`**: Similarly, calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(d7d100pir = ...)`**: This second `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed averages (`avg_pasi_d7` and `avg_pasi_d100`) to apply the D7D100PIR formula: `(avg_d100 - avg_d7) / avg_d7 * 100.0`. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.

The calculation must only include outcomes where patients have non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

Here's the step-by-step derivation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Filter Relevant Outcomes**: First, we create a collection `outcomes_with_both_scores` that includes only those records from the `Outcomes` collection where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. This ensures that the averages for day 7 and day 100 PASI scores are calculated over the same set of outcome records.
2.  **Calculate Average PASI Scores**: Using the `outcomes_with_both_scores` collection, we calculate the overall average of `day7_pasi_score` (as `avg_pasi_d7_val`) and `day100_pasi_score` (as `avg_pasi_d100_val`). These calculations are performed at the top `DermTreatment` graph level to get overall averages.
3.  **Compute D7D100PIR**: Finally, we apply the D7D100PIR formula using the calculated averages. We use `IFF` to handle the case where `avg_pasi_d7_val` might be zero, returning `None` to prevent division by zero errors. The multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and that floating-point arithmetic is used.

The final result will be a single row containing the calculated `d7d100pir_percentage`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter Outcomes to include only records with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.
# This ensures that averages are based on the same population of outcome records.
outcomes_with_both_scores = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))

# Step 2 & 3: Calculate overall average PASI scores and then the D7D100PIR.
# Calculations are done at the DermTreatment graph level for overall values.
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate the average day 7 PASI score from the filtered outcomes.
    avg_pasi_d7_val = AVG(outcomes_with_both_scores.day7_pasi_score),
    # Calculate the average day 100 PASI score from the filtered outcomes.
    avg_pasi_d100_val = AVG(outcomes_with_both_scores.day100_pasi_score)
).CALCULATE(
    # Apply the D7D100PIR formula.
    # D7D100PIR = (avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100
    # Use IFF to handle potential division by zero if avg_pasi_d7_val is 0.
    d7d100pir_percentage = IFF(
        avg_pasi_d7_val == 0,
        None,  # Return None if avg_pasi_d7_val is zero
        (avg_pasi_d100_val - avg_pasi_d7_val) / avg_pasi_d7_val * 100.0
    )
)
```
This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  It defines `outcomes_with_both_scores` as a subset of `Outcomes` records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (not null).
2.  It then calculates `avg_pasi_d7_val` (average day 7 PASI score) and `avg_pasi_d100_val` (average day 100 PASI score) using these filtered `outcomes_with_both_scores`. These are global averages calculated via `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`.
3.  A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes `d7d100pir_percentage` using the previously calculated averages and the provided formula. It includes a check for division by zero, returning `None` if the average day 7 PASI score is zero. The result is multiplied by `100.0` to express it as a percentage.",57.15408158302307,"# Step 1: Filter Outcomes to include only records with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

1.  Iterate through each drug in the `Drugs` collection.

    a.  Is associated with a treatment where this drug was used.
    b.  Was reported in the same calendar month and year as the start date of that treatment.
3.  To do this, for each drug, we access its `treatments_used_in`.
4.  For each of these treatments, we determine its start year and start month.
5.  Then, we access the `adverse_events` associated with that treatment.
6.  We filter these adverse events, keeping only those where the `reported_dt` (adverse event's reported date) has the same year and month as the treatment's `start_dt`.
7.  The `COUNT` function then sums up all such filtered adverse events across all treatments for the current drug.
8.  After calculating this count for every drug, along with retaining the drug's ID and name, we use `TOP_K(1, ...)` to find the drug with the maximum count.

The query will return the `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and the calculated `num_matching_adverse_events` for the top drug.

3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""states"", by=(loc_state))`**: Groups the filtered doctors by their location state (`loc_state`). This ensures that each state appears only once in the result.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have at least one prescribed treatment where the associated drug's `drug_type` is 'Biologic'. We can use the `HAS` function in conjunction with a `WHERE` clause on the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection to check this condition. The condition inside the nested `WHERE` will be `drug.drug_type == 'Biologic'`.
3.  Once we have the filtered list of doctors, we need to find the distinct states they reside in. We can achieve this by using the `PARTITION` function, grouping the filtered doctors by their `loc_state`.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to output the `loc_state` for each group, which will give us the distinct states.

```python
distinct_doctor_states_for_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(
    HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1
).PARTITION(
    name=""state_group"", by=(loc_state)

**Explanation:**

1.  `Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1)`:
    *   This part starts with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1` checks if a doctor has at least one (`== 1`) prescribed treatment that satisfies the inner condition.
    *   The inner condition `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')` filters the treatments associated with a doctor to only those where the `drug_type` of the `drug` used in the treatment is 'Biologic'.

2.  `.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=(loc_state))`:
    *   This takes the doctors who passed the filter (i.e., doctors who prescribed biologic drugs).
    *   It then partitions these doctors into groups based on their `loc_state`. Each group will correspond to a unique state.

3.  `.CALCULATE(state = loc_state)`:
    *   For each group created by the `PARTITION` (i.e., for each distinct state), this selects the `loc_state` (which is the partitioning key) and names it `state` in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_filtered`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and filter it to include only those records where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)`. We then use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `ins_type` (insurance type) from the related `patient` record, creating a temporary field `insurance_type` needed for partitioning.
2.  **`insurance_type_groups`**: We partition the `treatments_filtered` data using `PARTITION`. The `name=""ins_type_group""` assigns a name to the partition context, and `by=(insurance_type)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `insurance_type` calculated in the previous step.
3.  **`insurance_type_stats`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `insurance_type` group:
    *   `ins_type = insurance_type`: We select the insurance type (the partition key).
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: We calculate the average of the `day100_pasi_score` found in the `outcome_records` associated with the `Treatments` belonging to the current insurance type group. `AVG` handles the aggregation over the potentially multiple treatments and outcomes within the group.
    *   `distinct_patient_count = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: We count the number of unique patients (`patient_id`) associated with the `Treatments` in the current insurance type group using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  **`top_5_insurance_types`**: We use `TOP_K(5, by=avg_day100_pasi.ASC())` to select the top 5 records from `insurance_type_stats`, ordering them by the calculated `avg_day100_pasi` in ascending order (lowest score first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Treatments**: The code starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to include only those treatments where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022.
2.  **Prepare for Partitioning**: It then creates a new view `treatments_with_insurance_info` by adding `p_ins_type` (patient's insurance type, derived from `patient.ins_type`) to each filtered treatment record. This is necessary because partition keys must be direct fields of the collection being partitioned.
3.  **Partition by Insurance Type**: The `treatments_with_insurance_info` collection is partitioned by `p_ins_type`. This groups all treatments belonging to the same patient insurance type together.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each insurance type group, the code calculates:
    *   `insurance_type`: The patient insurance type.
    *   `avg_pasi_score_d100`: The average `day100_pasi_score` found in the `outcome_records` of all treatments within that insurance group. The `AVG` function handles the aggregation across potentially multiple outcome records per treatment and multiple treatments per group.
    *   `num_distinct_patients`: The number of unique `patient_id`s associated with the treatments in that insurance group, ensuring each patient is counted only once per group.
5.  **Select Top 5**: Finally, the `TOP_K` function selects the top 5 insurance types, sorted in ascending order based on their `avg_pasi_score_d100` (lowest average PASI score first). The final result includes the insurance type, the calculated average PASI score at day 100, and the number of distinct patients for these top 5 insurance types.",54.81962466239929,"# Step 1: Filter treatments that ended in the year 2022.

1.  **`Diagnoses.WHERE(...)`**: Starts with the `Diagnoses` collection and filters it to include only those diagnoses that have at least one associated treatment (`treatments_for`) which in turn has at least one outcome record (`outcome_records`) where the `day100_itch_vas` score is not null. This ensures we only consider diagnoses with relevant data for the ranking.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered diagnosis:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Selects the name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score_d100=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score found within all `outcome_records` linked to the treatments (`treatments_for`) associated with the current diagnosis.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cutoff_date_calc`**: We first calculate the date marking the beginning of our 6-month window. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months', 'start of month')` gets the current date, subtracts 6 months, and then finds the first day of that resulting month. This ensures we capture full calendar months.
2.  **`recent_treatments_info`**: We filter the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `six_months_ago_start`. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `speciality` from the linked `doctor` record, naming it `doc_specialty` to prepare for partitioning.
3.  **`specialty_groups`**: We use `PARTITION` to group the `recent_treatments_info` collection by the `doc_specialty`. Each group in `specialties` represents a unique doctor specialty.
4.  **`specialty_stats`**: For each specialty group created by the partition, we `CALCULATE` the required aggregates:
    *   `specialty=doc_specialty`: We retrieve the specialty name (which was the partition key).
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments)`: We count the number of `Treatments` records within each specialty group (using the original `Treatments` context available within the partition).
    *   `total_drug_amount=SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: We sum the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within each specialty group.
5.  **`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`**: We apply `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` to the `specialty_stats` to select the top 3 records based on the calculated `total_drug_amount` in descending order.
6.  **`result = ...`**: The final result containing the top 3 specialties, their treatment counts, and total drug amounts is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.33077478408813,"# Calculate the start date for the 6-month window (start of the month, 6 months ago)

For example, if today is August 15, 2024, this period would cover February 1, 2024, to July 31, 2024, inclusive.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select `Treatments` that have a `start_dt` within this defined period.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For these filtered treatments, we access the `speciality` of the prescribing `doctor`. This specialty will be used as the key for grouping.
4.  **Group by Specialty and Aggregate**: We use `PARTITION` to group the prepared treatment data by `doctor.speciality`. For each specialty group, we:
    *   Count the number of treatments (`COUNT(Treatments)`).
    *   Sum the `tot_drug_amt` for these treatments (`SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`).
5.  **Select Top 3**: We use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 specialties based on the `total_drug_amount` in descending order.
6.  **Format Output**: The final result will include the `specialty`, `number_of_treatments`, and `total_drug_amount`.

We will interpret ""top 5 by X and Y"" as primarily sorting by X (number of treatments) to determine the top 5.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:
1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  Filter out drugs that have no associated treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in) == 1)`. This ensures that `COUNT` and `AVG` operations are meaningful.
3.  For the remaining drugs, use a `CALCULATE` clause to:
    *   Alias `drug_name` as `drug_name_output`.
    *   Calculate the total number of treatments for each drug as `num_treatments_output` using `COUNT(treatments_used_in)`.
    *   Calculate the average total drug amount per treatment as `avg_drug_amount_output` using `AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`.
4.  Use `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments_output.DESC())` to select the top 5 drugs. The sorting is based on `num_treatments_output` in descending order.
5.  A final `CALCULATE` clause is used to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `drug_name`, `number_of_treatments`, and `average_drug_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need to perform a global count aggregation.
2.  **`num_matching_treatments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a result field `num_matching_treatments` and assign it the count of the filtered `Treatments`.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and apply a filter based on the specified conditions.
4.  **`(CONTAINS(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), 'psoriasis'))`**: This checks the first condition. It accesses the linked `diagnosis`, gets its `diag_name`, converts it to lowercase using `LOWER` for case-insensitivity, and then uses `CONTAINS` to check if 'psoriasis' is a substring.
5.  **`(drug.fda_appr_dt != None)`**: This checks the second condition. It accesses the linked `drug` and verifies that its `fda_appr_dt` field is not null, indicating it has an FDA approval date.
6.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This checks the third condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time exactly 6 months before the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   The condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` falls strictly after 6 months ago and is less than or equal to the current moment.

1.  Access the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filter these treatments based on three conditions:
    *   The associated diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitively, using wildcards). This is checked using `LIKE(LOWER(Treatments.diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`.
    *   The drug used in the treatment has been FDA-approved. This is checked by ensuring the `fda_appr_dt` field in the associated `Drugs` record is not null, using `HAS(Treatments.drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   The treatment ended within the last 6 months from today. This is checked by comparing the `Treatments.end_dt` with the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`) and today (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition is `(Treatments.end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (Treatments.end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`.
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all the above conditions. This count will be calculated on the `DermTreatment` graph.

```python
# Define the filtering conditions for treatments
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Condition for diagnosis name
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &  # Condition for FDA-approved drug

This PyDough code snippet first defines a collection `filtered_treatments` by applying all the specified conditions to the `Treatments` collection.
- It checks if the lowercase version of the diagnosis name (accessed via `Treatments.diagnosis.diag_name`) contains ""psoriasis"" using `LIKE` for wildcard matching.
- It verifies that the drug used in the treatment is FDA-approved by checking for the existence of an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) in the linked drug record (`Treatments.drug.fda_appr_dt`).
- It ensures the treatment's `end_dt` falls within the last 6 months from the current date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`**: This calculates the registration year we are interested in by getting the current year using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))` and subtracting 2.
2.  **`doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection to include only those whose `year_reg` matches the `target_year` and who have at least one prescribed treatment (`HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`).
3.  **`result = doctors_registered_2_years_ago.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates the first calculation step on the filtered doctors.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's registration year.
    *   `first_treatment_record=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`: This finds the first treatment for each doctor.
        *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1)`: Ranks the treatments within the context of each doctor (`per=""Doctors""`) based on the `start_dt` in ascending order. It then filters to keep only the treatment ranked first (the earliest one).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the ranking filter yields exactly one treatment record per doctor, allowing us to treat it as a singular record.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This second `CALCULATE` is used to access the fields *within* the `first_treatment_record` that was created in the previous step.
    *   `doc_last_name=doc_last_name`: Passes through the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=doc_year_reg`: Passes through the doctor's registration year.

2.  Filter Doctors: We'll select doctors from the `Doctors` collection who were registered in that target year and have at least one prescribed treatment (using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`).
3.  Identify the First Treatment: For each selected doctor, we need to find their earliest treatment. We can do this by ordering their `prescribed_treatments` by `start_dt` in ascending order and taking the top one using `TOP_K(1, by=start_dt.ASC())`. We then use `.SINGULAR()` to get this single treatment record.
4.  Extract Information: We'll use a `CALCULATE` operation to get the doctor's `last_name` and `year_reg`. We'll create an intermediate field for the first treatment record.

**Explanation:**

1.  `target_reg_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`: This line defines a variable holding the year that was two years prior to the current year.
2.  `selected_doctors = Doctors.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `year_reg == target_reg_year`: It keeps doctors whose registration year matches the calculated `target_reg_year`.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`: It ensures that only doctors who have at least one treatment record are included.
3.  `result = selected_doctors.CALCULATE(...)`: The first `CALCULATE` processes each doctor from `selected_doctors`.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's year of registration.
    *   `first_treatment_record=prescribed_treatments.TOP_K(1, by=start_dt.ASC()).SINGULAR()`: This part identifies the first treatment for the current doctor.
        *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the doctor.
        *   `.TOP_K(1, by=start_dt.ASC())`: Sorts these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order and selects the top one (the earliest). This returns a collection containing a single treatment.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the single-item collection into a single treatment record.
4.  The second `.CALCULATE(...)`: This takes the output of the first `CALCULATE` and further refines it.
    *   `doc_last_name=doc_last_name`, `doc_year_reg=doc_year_reg`: Passes through the doctor's information.
    *   `first_treatment_id=first_treatment_record.treatment_id`: Extracts the `treatment_id` from the `first_treatment_record` obtained in the previous step.
    *   `first_treatment_date=first_treatment_record.start_dt`: Extracts the `start_dt` (start date) from the `first_treatment_record`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection as we are primarily interested in finding specific adverse events.
2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: We filter these events based on their timing relative to the treatment start date.
3.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)`**: This calculates the difference in days between the start date of the associated treatment (`treatment.start_dt`) and the date the adverse event was reported (`reported_dt`).
4.  **`(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: This condition selects adverse events where the report date is on or after the treatment start date (`>= 0`) and no more than 10 days after the treatment start date (`<= 10`).
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select the required fields for the filtered adverse events:

1.  Start with the `AdverseEvents` collection.
2.  For each adverse event, access its related `treatment` record to get the `start_dt` (treatment start date) and `treatment_id`.
3.  Filter these adverse events by checking two conditions:
    *   The `reported_dt` (adverse event date) must be on or after the `treatment.start_dt`.
    *   The difference in days between `treatment.start_dt` and `reported_dt` must be less than or equal to 10. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)` for this.
4.  Use `CALCULATE` to select the required fields: `treatment.treatment_id`, `treatment.start_dt`, `reported_dt`, and `description`.

```python
adverse_events_within_10_days = AdverseEvents.WHERE(

1.  It starts with the `AdverseEvents` collection.
2.  The `WHERE` clause filters these events:

    *   `reported_dt >= treatment.start_dt`: This ensures that the adverse event occurred on or after the treatment started.
3.  The `CALCULATE` clause then selects and renames the required fields:

2.  **`qualifying_meds = placebo_treatments.concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each of the previously filtered `placebo_treatments`. It then applies another `WHERE` clause to filter these concomitant medications.
3.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`**: This calculates the difference in days between the start date of the parent treatment (`treatment.start_dt`) and the start date of the concomitant medication (`start_dt`). It ensures the medication started on or after the treatment began.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`**: This ensures the difference calculated above is less than or equal to 14 days (2 weeks).
5.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines the two `DATEDIFF` conditions, so only concomitant medications starting 0 to 14 days (inclusive) after the treatment start date are kept.

For each such pair, it should display the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates of the concomitant medication.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to select only those records where `is_placebo` is true.
2.  For these placebo treatments, it uses `CALCULATE` to preserve the original `treatment_id`, `start_dt` (treatment start date), and `end_dt` (treatment end date) under new names (`orig_treatment_id`, `orig_treatment_start_dt`, `orig_treatment_end_dt`). This makes these parent treatment details available to the subsequent operations on their sub-collections.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each of these selected placebo treatments.
4.  A `WHERE` clause filters these `concomitant_meds`. A medication qualifies if its `start_dt` (medication start date) is on or after the `orig_treatment_start_dt` (treatment start date) and no more than 14 days after it. This is checked using `DATEDIFF(""days"", orig_treatment_start_dt, start_dt)`, ensuring the difference is between 0 and 14 days, inclusive.
5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used on the qualifying `concomitant_meds` to select the desired information:
    *   `treatment_record_id`: The ID of the placebo treatment (from `orig_treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start`: The start date of the placebo treatment (from `orig_treatment_start_dt`).
    *   `treatment_end`: The end date of the placebo treatment (from `orig_treatment_end_dt`).
    *   `concomitant_med_start`: The start date of the qualifying concomitant medication (its own `start_dt`).
    *   `concomitant_med_end`: The end date of the qualifying concomitant medication (its own `end_dt`).

The result will be a collection of records, where each record represents a specific concomitant medication that met the timing criteria, along with details of its parent placebo treatment.

1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` (insurance type) is 'Private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (`DATETIME('now')`), specifying ""years"" as the unit.
4.  Compute the average of these calculated ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  Round the final average age to 0 decimal places to ensure it's an integer, as requested.
6.  The final result will be a single value representing this average age.

1.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private'))`: This part filters the `Patients` collection to select only those patients who are male and have private insurance.
2.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_age = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each patient in the filtered set, this calculates their current age.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This result is stored in a temporary field named `calculated_age`.
3.  `AVG(...)`: This function takes the average of the `calculated_age` values for all patients who met the criteria.
4.  `ROUND(AVG(...), 0)`: The average age, which might be a floating-point number, is rounded to 0 decimal places, effectively converting it to an integer.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_name=name`**: Selects the merchant's name.
3.  **`distinct_successful_tx=COUNT(...)`**: This calculates the denominator for CPUR.
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'successful')`: Filters the transactions received by the merchant to include only those marked as 'successful'.
    *   `.txid`: Accesses the transaction ID field.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of successful transaction IDs for the merchant. We use `COUNT` assuming `txid` is unique per transaction.
4.  **`distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(...)`**: This calculates the numerator for CPUR.
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'successful') & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: Filters the received transactions for those that are 'successful' AND have an associated coupon (`HAS(coupon) == 1`).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` field from these filtered transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s used in successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  **`cpur_rate=IFF(...)`**: This calculates the CPUR.
    *   `IFF(distinct_successful_tx > 0, ... , 0.0)`: Uses the `IFF` function to prevent division by zero. If the count of distinct successful transactions is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used / distinct_successful_tx`: Performs the division to get the CPUR.
    *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions (`distinct_successful_tx` is 0), the CPUR is set to 0.0.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_name=merchant_name, CPUR=cpur_rate)`**: This final `CALCULATE` step selects only the `merchant_name` and the calculated `cpur_rate` (renamed to `CPUR`) for the final output, as requested.",26.01082420349121,"# Calculate CPUR for each merchant based on successful transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary time boundaries using `Ewallet.CALCULATE`. `start_of_current_week` is the beginning of the current week, and `start_of_3_weeks_ago` is the beginning of the week three weeks prior to the current week's start.
2.  **`filtered_users`**: We filter the `Users` collection to include only those whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA' using `WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`.
3.  **`relevant_notifications`**: We access the `notifications` sub-collection for the `filtered_users`. We then filter these notifications using `WHERE` to keep only those created within the desired time frame (`>= start_of_3_weeks_ago` and `< start_of_current_week`). Inside `CALCULATE`, we determine the start of the week (`notification_week`) for each notification using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')` and create a boolean flag `is_weekend` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`.
4.  **`weekly_groups`**: We partition the `relevant_notifications` using `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=(notification_week))`. This groups the notifications based on the week they were sent.
5.  **`weekly_counts`**: For each partition (each week), we use `CALCULATE` to compute:
    *   `week_start_date`: The partitioning key itself (the start date of the week).
    *   `total_notifications`: The total count of notifications in that week's group, obtained using `COUNT(Notifications)`.
    *   `weekend_notifications`: The count of notifications sent on weekends within that week. This is calculated by summing the `is_weekend` flag (where True counts as 1 and False as 0) using `SUM(Notifications.is_weekend)`. We access the calculated `is_weekend` field through the `Notifications` sub-collection within the partition context.
6.  **`result`**: Finally, we select the required columns (`week_start_date`, `total_notifications`, `weekend_notifications`) and order the results by the week start date in ascending order for readability using `ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())`.",31.06267166137696,"# Define the time boundaries for the last 3 weeks (excluding the current week)

    *   `is_weekend_day`: A boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the notification was created on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using the `DAYNAME` function.
4.  Define the target time period: This period spans the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
    *   `target_period_starts_on`: The Monday three weeks before the start of the current week.
    *   `target_period_ends_on`: The Monday of the current week (this date is exclusive, so it covers up to the end of last week).

    *   `sending_user.country == ""US""`: This filters the transactions to include only those where the sending user's country is 'US'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters transactions to those created within the last 7 days, inclusive of the current day. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days between `created_at` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). A value of `0` means today, `1` means yesterday, and so on, up to `6` for six days ago.
2.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: We then use the top-level `Ewallet` collection to calculate global aggregates from the `filtered_us_transactions`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_user_balances`: This variable stores records from the `UserBalances` collection that have been updated within the last 7 days (inclusive). The `DATEDIFF` function calculates the difference in days between the `updated_at` timestamp and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
2.  `per_user_amb`: This variable calculates the Average Monthly Balance (AMB) for each individual user.
    *   It starts with `recent_user_balances`.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""user_balance_group"", by=(user_id))` groups these balances by `user_id`.
    *   `CALCULATE(amb_for_this_user = AVG(UserBalances.balance))` then computes the average of the `balance` amounts for each user within their respective group. This average is the AMB for that user over the specified period, based on their recorded balance updates.
3.  `average_amb_result`: This final step calculates the overall average of the `amb_for_this_user` values obtained in the previous step. The `Ewallet.CALCULATE` is used because we expect a single aggregated value. The result is stored in a field named `average_balance` as requested.

3.  **`LUB=DEFAULT_TO(...)`**: This part calculates the Latest User Balance (LUB).
    *   **`balances`**: This refers to the `UserBalances` sub-collection associated with each user.
    *   **`.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This window function is applied to each user's `balances`.

The `per=""Users""` clause ensures that this ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
        *   `== 1`: We filter these ranked balances to keep only the one with rank 1, which corresponds to the most recent balance entry for that specific user.
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause with `RANKING(...) == 1` ensures that at most one balance record is selected per user, `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record. This allows us to access its fields directly.

2.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.

    *   `per=""Users""`: This crucial part ensures the ranking is done *independently for each user*. Snapshots are only ranked against other snapshots belonging to the same user.
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the snapshot with rank 1, which is the latest one for that specific user.
3.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause guarantees that only one snapshot (the latest) is selected per user, we use `SINGULAR()` to treat the result as a single record within the context of each user.
4.  **`result = Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We then perform a `CALCULATE` operation on the `Users` collection.
5.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's ID (`uid`) and rename it to `user_id`.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant (`merchant_revenues_calc`):**
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we use the `CALCULATE` function to compute new fields:
        *   `m_name`: The merchant's `name`.
        *   `m_category`: The merchant's `category`.
        *   `rev_amount`: This is the total revenue for the merchant. It's calculated by:
            *   Accessing `transactions_received`, which is a sub-collection of transactions where the current merchant is the receiver.
            *   Filtering these transactions using `WHERE` to include only those where:
                *   `status == ""completed""` (ensuring the transaction was successful).
                *   `receiver_type == 1` (as specified in the request, assuming `1` denotes a merchant receiver type within the transaction data).
            *   Summing the `amount` of these filtered transactions using the `SUM()` aggregation function. If a merchant has no such transactions, their `rev_amount` will typically be 0 or null, and they will be ranked accordingly.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Final Output (`mrr_results`):**
    *   We take the `merchant_revenues_calc` collection (which now has `m_name`, `m_category`, and `rev_amount` for each merchant).
    *   Another `CALCULATE` function is used to:
        *   Select the desired output fields: `merchant_name` (from `m_name`), `category` (from `m_category`), and `revenue_amount` (from `rev_amount`).
        *   Calculate `revenue_rank`: The `RANKING()` window function is applied to rank merchants based on their `rev_amount`.
            *   `by=rev_amount.DESC()` ensures that merchants with higher revenue get a lower (better) rank (e.g., rank 1 for the highest revenue).
            *   The default behavior of `RANKING` regarding ties (`allow_ties=False`) is used, meaning ranks will be unique (e.g., 1, 2, 3,...).

2.  **Filter Transactions**: We select transactions that fall within this calculated date range and have `sender_type == 0`.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For these filtered transactions, we extract the year and month from the `created_at` field. This will be used as the key for partitioning. `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')` truncates the date to the first moment of its month.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: We partition the prepared transaction data by the extracted year-month. For each month group, we calculate the PMDAU by counting the number of distinct `sender_id` values from the `Transactions` collection (respecting the prior filters).

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two date boundaries:
    *   `current_month_start_val`: The first moment of the current month. This serves as the exclusive upper bound for our transaction date range.
    *   `two_months_ago_start_val`: The first moment of the month that was two months before the current month. This is the inclusive lower bound.
    For example, if today is July 15th, `current_month_start_val` would be July 1st 00:00:00, and `two_months_ago_start_val` would be May 1st 00:00:00.

2.  `monthly_transactions_base = date_info.Transactions.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with `date_info.Transactions` to access all transactions while having the calculated dates available.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions:
        *   `created_at >= two_months_ago_start_val`: Includes transactions from the start of the month two months ago.
        *   `created_at < current_month_start_val`: Excludes transactions from the current month.
        *   `sender_type == 0`: Filters for transactions where the sender is of type 0, as per the PMDAU definition.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause derives `transaction_year_month` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp of each transaction to the start of its month (e.g., '2023-05-15 10:30:00' becomes '2023-05-01 00:00:00'). This field will be used for grouping.

3.  `pmdau_final_results = monthly_transactions_base.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_year_month))`: This groups the records from `monthly_transactions_base` based on their `transaction_year_month`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these monthly groups:
        *   `aggregation_month_col=transaction_year_month`: Selects the month for which the PMDAU is being calculated.
        *   `pmdau_val=NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`: Calculates the PMDAU for that month. `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)` counts the unique `sender_id` values from the `Transactions` collection, implicitly within the current partition (month) and respecting the filters (date range, `sender_type`) applied when creating `monthly_transactions_base`.

The `pmdau_final_results` variable will hold a collection where each record contains a month (`aggregation_month_col`) and the corresponding PMDAU value (`pmdau_val`) for that month, covering the last two full months prior to the current one.",67.22172856330872,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the last 2 months, excluding the current month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users`**: We start with the `Users` collection, as the request focuses on users.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to process each user record and derive new fields or select existing ones.
3.  **`user_id=uid`**: This selects the `uid` field from each user record and assigns it to the new field name `user_id` in the output.
4.  **`total_transactions_sent=COUNT(transactions_sent)`**: This calculates the total number of transactions sent by each user.
    *   `transactions_sent` is the sub-collection linking a user to the transactions they have sent.
    *   `COUNT()` is an aggregation function that counts the number of records in the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for the current user.
    *   The result of the count is assigned to the new field name `total_transactions_sent`.
5.  **`user_transaction_counts = ...`**: The final result, containing the `user_id` and `total_transactions_sent` for each user, is assigned to the variable `user_transaction_counts`.

This query iterates through all users and, for each one, counts how many transactions are listed in their `transactions_sent` list, effectively giving the total number of transactions sent by that user.

3.  Count the number of such sessions.

We will use the `DATETIME` function to define the start and end of the period.

3.  `sessions_in_defined_period = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `UserSessions` collection. It keeps only those sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is greater than or equal to `one_month_ago_timestamp` AND less than or equal to `current_timestamp`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`prev_month_info`**: We first calculate the year (`prev_month_year`) and month (`prev_month_month`) corresponding to the previous month using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
2.  **`prev_month_transactions`**: We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions where the `created_at` date matches the calculated `prev_month_year` and `prev_month_month`.
3.  **`transaction_counts`**: We calculate two values:
    *   `total_tx`: The total count of transactions found in the previous month.
    *   `successful_tx`: The count of transactions from the previous month where the `status` is 'completed' (assuming 'completed' signifies a successful transaction).
4.  **`previous_month_str`**: We calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR).
    *   We use the `IFF` function to check if `total_tx` is greater than 0.
    *   If `total_tx` > 0, we calculate STR as `(successful_tx / total_tx) * 100.0` to get a percentage. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division.
    *   If `total_tx` is 0, we return `0.0` to avoid division by zero errors.
    *   Finally, `.str_value` selects only the calculated STR value.",15.916045188903809,"# Calculate the year and month of the previous month

1.  **Identify the Previous Month**: We calculate the year and month corresponding to the month immediately preceding the current one. This is achieved by taking the current date, going to the start of the current month, and then subtracting one month.
2.  **Count Total Transactions**: We count all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that occurred within this previously identified year and month.
3.  **Count Successful Transactions**: We count all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that occurred within the same previous month and have a `status` of `""completed""`. We assume `""completed""` signifies a successful transaction.
4.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is then calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100`. We handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero, returning `0.0` in such a scenario.

All transactions in the `Transactions` table are considered ""wallet transactions"" for this query, as no specific `transaction_type` for ""wallet transactions"" is provided.

        (100.0 * num_successful_tx) / num_total_tx,
        0.0
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block determines `target_year_val` and `target_month_val` which represent the year and month of the previous month relative to the current date. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')` gets a date within the previous month, and `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` extract the respective parts.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` block uses these values to:
    *   Calculate `num_successful_tx`: It filters `Transactions` for those created in the `target_year_val` and `target_month_val` and where the `status` is `""completed""`. It then counts these transactions.
    *   Calculate `num_total_tx`: It filters `Transactions` for all transactions created in the `target_year_val` and `target_month_val`, and then counts them.
3.  The third `CALCULATE` block computes the `str_for_previous_month`:
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `num_total_tx` is greater than 0.
    *   If true, it calculates the STR as `(100.0 * num_successful_tx) / num_total_tx` to get a percentage. The `100.0` ensures floating-point arithmetic.
    *   If `num_total_tx` is 0 (to prevent division by zero), it returns `0.0`.

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: Starts by accessing the `Users` collection and applying filters.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: Filters users whose country is 'US', ignoring case by converting the `country` field to lowercase.
3.  **`& (HAS(...) == 1)`**: Adds a second condition using the logical AND (`&`). The `HAS` function checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the inner criteria.
4.  **`notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))`**: This inner `WHERE` clause filters the `notifications` sub-collection for each user, selecting only those notifications where `notification_type` is exactly 'promotional' and `status` is exactly 'unread'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering the users, this step selects and calculates the final output fields for each matching user.
6.  **`user_name=username`**: Selects the `username` field and renames it to `user_name`.
7.  **`total_unread_promotional=COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of notifications for the current user that satisfy the same conditions used in the `HAS` check (`notification_type == 'promotional'` and `status == 'unread'`) and assigns the count to the `total_unread_promotional` field.",19.66500473022461,"result = Users.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_in_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on several criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Filters transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures that the sender was a user, excluding transactions sent by merchants.
    *   `status == 'completed'`: Includes only transactions that were successfully completed.
    *   `sending_user.status == 'active'`: Filters for transactions where the sending user has an 'active' status in the `Users` collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_month = ...)`**: For the filtered transactions, it calculates a new field `transaction_month` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `created_at` timestamp, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". This format is suitable for grouping and ordering chronologically.
3.  **`monthly_active_users = transactions_in_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transactions_in_2023` collection into groups based on the unique values of `transaction_month`. Each partition (`monthly_group`) contains all the filtered transactions for a specific month.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(month_date = ..., num_distinct_active_users = ...)`**: Within each monthly partition, this calculates:
    *   `month_date`: Selects the `transaction_month` value for the output.
    *   `num_distinct_active_users`: Uses `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sending_user)` to count the number of unique sending users within that specific month's transaction group. `Transactions.sending_user` refers back to the sending users associated with the transactions within the current partition.
5.  **`result = monthly_active_users.ORDER_BY(month_date.ASC())`**: Finally, this sorts the results based on the `month_date` in ascending order (from earliest month to latest).

We need to consider only successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (as a date) and the count of distinct active users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions (`relevant_transactions`)**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions based on several criteria:
        *   The transaction must have occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
        *   The sender must be a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
        *   The transaction status must be successful (`status == ""successful""`).
        *   The sending user must be active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`). This accesses the `status` of the related `Users` record via the `sending_user` link.
    *   For the filtered transactions, it calculates two new fields:
        *   `transaction_month_start_date`: This derives the first day of the month for each transaction's `created_at` date. This will be used for grouping and as the output date for the month.
        *   `s_user_uid`: This extracts the `uid` of the sending user from the related `Users` record. This ID will be used for counting distinct users.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users (`monthly_active_senders`)**:
    *   The `relevant_transactions` are then partitioned by `transaction_month_start_date`. This groups all transactions that occurred in the same month.
    *   For each month group, it calculates:
        *   `month_as_date`: This is the `transaction_month_start_date` (the partition key), representing the month.
        *   `num_active_users`: This counts the number of distinct sending user UIDs (`NDISTINCT(Transactions.s_user_uid)`) within that month's group of transactions. `Transactions.s_user_uid` refers to the `s_user_uid` field of the transactions belonging to the current month's partition.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_as_date` in ascending order, so the earliest month comes first.

4.  **Assign to `result`**:
    *   The final result of these operations is assigned to the variable `result`.

For these top countries, we need to return the country name, the number of distinct users who sent transactions, and the total transaction amount.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  We start with the `Users` collection because the aggregation is based on user attributes (country) and their sent transactions.
2.  We use `PARTITION` to group users by their `country`.
3.  Within each country partition, we use `CALCULATE` to compute the required metrics:
    *   `country`: This is the country from the partition key.
    *   `num_distinct_users_who_sent`: We count the number of `Users` within the current country partition who have at least one transaction in their `transactions_sent` list where the `sender_type` is 0. This is achieved using `COUNT(Users.WHERE(HAS(transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)) == 1))`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: We sum the `amount` of all transactions in `transactions_sent` for users in the current country partition, filtered to include only those transactions where `sender_type` is 0. This is done using `SUM(Users.transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0).amount)`.
4.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 5 countries with the highest total transaction amounts.

    *   `num_distinct_users_who_sent=COUNT(Users.WHERE(HAS(transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)) == 1))`: Counts the number of distinct users within the current country who have sent at least one transaction where `sender_type` is 0.
        *   `Users.transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)`: Filters the sent transactions of each user to include only those with `sender_type == 0`.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if a user has at least one such transaction.
        *   `COUNT(Users.WHERE(...))`: Counts the users satisfying this condition within the country group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider merchants who have received at least one transaction (`transactions_received`) that meets the specified criteria.
3.  **`transactions_received.WHERE((DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150) & (receiver_type == 1))`**: Inside the `HAS`, `COUNT`, and `SUM` functions, we filter the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant. The filter keeps only transactions where:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150`: The transaction occurred within the last 150 days (inclusive). We use `DATEDIFF` to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` timestamp and the current time (`'now'`).
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: The transaction's `receiver_type` is 1, explicitly matching the request, even though `transactions_received` implies the merchant is the receiver.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the merchants who passed the `WHERE` filter, we calculate three fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: The name of the merchant.
    *   `total_transactions=COUNT(...)`: The count of transactions received by this merchant that satisfy the date and receiver type conditions.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(...).amount`: The sum of the `amount` for those same filtered transactions received by this merchant.

2.  `.CALCULATE(latest_balance_today = ...)`: For each merchant selected in the previous step, this calculates a new field named `latest_balance_today`.

-   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1)`: On the filtered 2023 snapshots, this applies a second filter. `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)` assigns a rank to each snapshot based on its `snapshot_date` (earliest date gets rank 1). `allow_ties=True` ensures all snapshots on the very earliest date receive rank 1. The `WHERE ... == 1` condition then selects only these earliest snapshots.
-   `.CALCULATE(average_tx_limit_daily = AVG(tx_limit_daily), average_tx_limit_monthly = AVG(tx_limit_monthly))`: This final step takes the set of earliest snapshots (from 2023) and calculates the average of their `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` values, naming them `average_tx_limit_daily` and `average_tx_limit_monthly` respectively.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line first accesses the `UserSessions` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to compute the duration of each session in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. It also explicitly includes `device_type` so it can be used as a partitioning key in the next step. The result is stored in the `session_durations` variable.
2.  **`session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the `session_durations` data and partitions it into groups based on the unique values in the `device_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `device_groups`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This `CALCULATE` operates on each partition created in the previous step.
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for the current group (which is the partitioning key).
    *   `avg_duration_seconds=AVG(UserSessions.session_duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `session_duration_seconds` (computed in the first step) for all sessions belonging to the current `device_type` group. We refer back to `UserSessions` within the aggregation to access the data belonging to the partition group.
4.  **`result = avg_session_duration_by_device`**: Assigns the final computed collection (containing `device_type` and `avg_duration_seconds` for each type) to the `result` variable.",19.497945070266724,"# Calculate duration in seconds for each session

1.  Start with the `UserSessions` collection.
2.  For each session, calculate its duration in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts`. We'll store this as `session_duration_seconds`. We also need to ensure `device_type` is carried forward for partitioning.
3.  Partition the resulting data by `device_type`. This will group all sessions by their device type.
4.  For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the `session_duration_seconds`.
5.  The final result will show each `device_type` and its corresponding average session duration in seconds.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create a new intermediate collection (`sessions_with_duration`).
    *   `device_type = device_type`: This ensures the `device_type` field is available for partitioning and in the final output.
    *   `session_duration_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: This calculates the duration of each session in seconds by finding the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` and names this new calculated field `session_duration_seconds`.

2.  `average_session_duration_by_device_type = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `sessions_with_duration` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_by_device"", by=(device_type))`: This partitions the records in `sessions_with_duration` into groups based on unique values of the `device_type` field. Each group is named `sessions_by_device` internally for this operation.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type = device_type, avg_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_with_duration.session_duration_seconds))`: This final `CALCULATE` operates on each partition (each group of `device_type`):

        *   `avg_duration_seconds = AVG(sessions_with_duration.session_duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `session_duration_seconds` for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. The result is named `avg_duration_seconds`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters out any merchants that do not have associated coupons using the `HAS` function.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates intermediate values for each remaining merchant:

    *   `earliest_coupon=coupons.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1).SINGULAR()`: This finds the earliest coupon for the *current* merchant.
        *   `coupons`: Accesses the list of coupons associated with the merchant.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: Filters these coupons. `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns a rank to each coupon based on its `start_date` (ascending), restarting the rank for each merchant (due to `per=""Merchants""`). We select the coupon with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which is technically a collection containing one coupon) into a single record so we can access its fields like `cid` and `start_date`.
3.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the merchants based on the date comparison:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", m_created_at, earliest_coupon.start_date)`: Calculates the difference in days between the merchant's creation date and the earliest coupon's start date.
