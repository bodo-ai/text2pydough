**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates:
        *   `c_name`: The customer's name.
        *   `num_total_transactions`: The total number of transactions made by the customer, using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `num_successful_transactions`: The number of successful transactions. This is calculated by counting transactions in `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `""Completed""`. **Note:** This assumes that a transaction status of `""Completed""` signifies a successful transaction, as the definition of ""success"" was not provided in the problem description.

2.  **`eligible_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`**:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It keeps only those customers who have `num_total_transactions` greater than or equal to 5, as per the requirement.

3.  **`customer_success_data = eligible_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `eligible_customers` and calculates their transaction success rate.
    *   It selects:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer (renamed from `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculated as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and performs floating-point division. Division by zero is not a concern here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures `num_total_transactions` is at least 5.

4.  **`ordered_customer_success_rates = customer_success_data.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, this step sorts the `customer_success_data` by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest), as requested.
    *   The `ordered_customer_success_rates` variable will contain the final list of customer names and their success rates, ordered appropriately.",31.627638816833496,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer.

    success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers, keeping only those for whom the count of their `transactions_made` (i.e., total transactions) is greater than or equal to 5.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   For each customer passing the filter, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: This selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0`:
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: This counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be the count of successful transactions.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: This counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The division of these two counts gives the ratio of successful transactions to total transactions.
            *   Multiplying by `100.0` converts this ratio to a percentage.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate`) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`.ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.",25.9496431350708,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in conjunction with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol`.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering and then counting records from the `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, obtained by using `Broker.CALCULATE`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple of FAANG stock ticker symbols. This is a contextless expression used for better readability in the query.
2.  `com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`: This condition checks if the customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that involves a FAANG stock.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: This filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through `transactions_made.ticker.symbol`) is present in the `faang_tickers` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function returns true if the preceding filtered sub-collection (`transactions_made` for FAANG stocks) is not empty for the customer.

3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_of_customers = COUNT(com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks))`:

3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition. It checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions for each customer.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

We'll use `CALCULATE` for this, with `COUNT(transactions_made)` for the number of transactions and `SUM(transactions_made.amount)` for the total transaction amount.
3.  On the result of the previous step, calculate the customer rank (CR). The rank is based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1). This can be done using the `RANKING` window function.
4.  The final `CALCULATE` will select the customer's name, the calculated number of transactions, the total transaction amount, and the computed rank (CR).

1.  The first `CALCULATE` operation processes the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it computes:

    *   `n_transactions`: The total count of transactions linked to the customer via the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `total_transaction_val`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by the customer.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the output of the first step (`customer_aggregates`). It selects the previously calculated fields and adds the `CR` (Customer Rank):
    *   `customer_name`: Renamed from `c_name`.
    *   `number_of_transactions`: Renamed from `n_transactions`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Renamed from `total_transaction_val`.
    *   `CR`: This is computed using the `RANKING(by=total_transaction_val.DESC())` function.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Broker` level to define `start_period_date` (6 months ago, start of that month) and `end_period_date` (start of the current month). These dates define our window of interest.
2.  `.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them to include only those whose `join_date` is within our calculated `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month_str=...)`: For these filtered customers, we create a new field `signup_month_str` by combining the year and month of their `join_date` (e.g., ""2023-07""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""signup_months_group"", by=(signup_month_str))`: We then partition these customers into groups based on their `signup_month_str`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month=signup_month_str, PMCS=COUNT(Customers), PMAT=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount))`: For each group (i.e., for each signup month):
    *   `signup_month`: We output the signup month string.
    *   `PMCS`: We calculate `COUNT(Customers)` which counts the number of customers within that specific `signup_month_str` group.
    *   `PMAT`: We calculate `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions (`transactions_made`) from all customers who signed up in that particular month and computes the average of their transaction `amount`.
6.  `.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`: Finally, the results are ordered chronologically by the `signup_month`.",37.4290337562561,"customer_signup_metrics = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `active_with_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer's status is ""active"" AND they have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). Otherwise, it's `False`.
    *   `has_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer has made at least one transaction. Otherwise, it's `False`.
3.  We then partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `active_with_tx_bool` flag. This counts customers who are active and have transactions. This forms the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `num_total_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `has_tx_bool` flag. This counts all customers who have transactions. This forms the denominator of the AR formula.
    (We assume `SUM` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, consistent with PyDough examples like `SUM(cust_info.is_active)`).
5.  Finally, we calculate the Activity Ratio (AR) using the provided formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `num_total_customers_with_transactions` is zero (i.e., no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), setting AR to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

The AR is defined as `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Here's how the PyDough code implements this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: It first selects customers who joined in 2022 using `Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`. For each of these customers, it creates a flag `is_active_flag` which is true (1) if the customer has made any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) and false (0) otherwise. This collection is named `filtered_customers`.

2.  **Group by Country and Aggregate**: The `filtered_customers` are then partitioned by their `country` using `PARTITION(name=""country_data"", by=(country))`. For each country group:
    *   `num_active_customers_in_country`: This is calculated by summing the `is_active_flag` for all customers in that country group (`SUM(filtered_customers.is_active_flag)`). This effectively counts customers who joined in 2022, belong to the specific country, and have transactions.
    *   `total_customers_in_country_cohort`: This is the total count of customers within that country group (`COUNT(filtered_customers)`), representing all customers who joined in 2022 and belong to that country.

3.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `activity_ratio_value`.
    *   The AR is `(num_active_customers_in_country * 100.0) / total_customers_in_country_cohort`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country_cohort` might be zero (i.e., no customers joined from that country in 2022) to prevent division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   This interpretation assumes that for the cohort ""customers who joined in 2022"", ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" refers to those in the cohort with transactions, and ""Total Number of Customers"" (in the denominator of the AR formula) refers to all customers in that cohort for the given country.

4.  **Format Final Result**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `country` and `AR` as requested.

    *   For the name condition, convert the `name` field to lowercase using `LOWER()`. Then, check if it either `STARTSWITH(""j"")` OR `ENDSWITH(""ez"")`.
    *   For the state condition, convert the `state` field to lowercase using `LOWER()`. Then, check if it `ENDSWITH(""a"")`.
    *   Combine these two conditions using an AND (`&`) operator.
3.  Count the number of customers that satisfy these conditions using the `COUNT()` function.
4.  Assign this count to a field in a `CALCULATE` expression on the `Broker` (top-level) collection.

```python
filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(
    num_matching_customers=COUNT(
        Customers.WHERE(
            (

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count of customers meeting the criteria).
2.  **`number_of_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `number_of_customers` that will hold the count.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`**: The `LOWER()` function is used on the `name` and `state` fields to ensure case-insensitive matching as requested.
5.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This part checks the first condition for the customer's name:
    *   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`: Checks if the lowercase name starts with 'j'.
    *   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two name conditions.
6.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This part checks the second condition: if the lowercase state ends with 'a'.
7.  **`&`**: The AND operator combines the name condition (itself a combination of two ORed conditions) and the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria.
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: After filtering, `COUNT()` counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy all the specified conditions.",13.495714664459229,"customer_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection to process each ticker individually.
2.  For each ticker, define a sub-collection `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. This sub-collection filters its `transactions_of` to include only those that:
    *   Have `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred on or after one month ago from the current date (`date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
3.  Filter out tickers that have no such sell transactions in the past month using `WHERE(HAS(sell_transactions_in_past_month) == 1)`.
4.  For the remaining tickers, calculate:
    *   `total_amount`: The sum of the `amount` from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`.
    *   `total_tax_comm`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. An inner `CALCULATE` is used to sum the combined `tax + commission` per transaction, adhering to PyDough syntax for expressions within aggregations.
5.  Calculate the `SPM` using the formula: `(total_amount - total_tax_comm) / total_amount * 100.0`.
    *   An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, setting SPM to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions**:
    The code first filters the `Transactions` collection to select only those transactions that:
    *   Are of `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred within the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"". This is achieved by checking if `date_time` is between `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` (exactly one month ago) and `DATETIME('now')` (the current moment).

2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate Metrics**:
    *   The filtered sell transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `ticker.symbol` using `filtered_sell_transactions.PARTITION(name=""sells_by_ticker"", by=(ticker.symbol))`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol with sell transactions in the specified period), the code calculates:
        *   `total_amount_sells`: The sum of the `amount` for all sell transactions of that ticker.
        *   `total_tax_and_commission`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) for all sell transactions of that ticker.

3.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) is calculated for each ticker symbol.
    *   The formula `SPM = (total_amount_sells - total_tax_and_commission) / total_amount_sells * 100.0` is applied.
    *   An `IFF` condition (`IFF(total_amount_sells == 0, 0.0, ...)` is used to handle cases where `total_amount_sells` might be zero. If it's zero, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors; otherwise, the SPM is calculated normally.

4.  **Final Output**:
    The `result` variable will contain a collection where each record includes the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding calculated `SPM` for sell transactions in the past month.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",116.09452176094057,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

1.  Start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  For each daily price record, calculate necessary fields:
    *   `stock_sym_calc`: The ticker symbol, accessed from the related `ticker` object (`ticker.symbol`).
    *   `price_dt_calc`: The date of the price record.
    *   `h_price_calc`: The high price for that day.
    *   `l_price_calc`: The low price for that day.
3.  Filter these records to include only those within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"".
4.  Partition the filtered data by `stock_sym_calc`. This groups all price records for the same stock together.
5.  For each stock group (partition):
    *   Calculate `overall_max_h`: The maximum `h_price_calc` (highest high price) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   Calculate `overall_min_l`: The minimum `l_price_calc` (lowest low price) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   The `ticker_symbol_output` will be the `stock_sym_calc` for that group.
6.  Calculate `price_change_output` as `overall_max_h - overall_min_l` for each stock.
7.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_output.DESC())` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest price change in descending order.
8.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `ticker_symbol` and `price_change` for the output.

```python
result = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(
    stock_sym_calc = ticker.symbol,
    price_dt_calc = date,

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates the process by iterating through each customer.
    *   `num_transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: For each customer, this calculates the number of transactions they made in the same month and year they joined.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It accesses the list of transactions for the current customer and filters them.
        *   `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions occurring in the same calendar month and year as the customer's `join_date` are considered. `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions extract the respective parts from the date fields.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the transactions that satisfy the condition.
    The result of this step is a collection of customers, each with their original fields plus the new `num_transactions_in_join_month` field.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This takes the collection from the previous step and selects the top 1 customer.
    *   `by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC()`: The selection is based on the `num_transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order, so the customer with the highest count is chosen.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, name=name, number_of_transactions=num_transactions_in_join_month)`: This final step formats the output.
    *   It selects the `_id` and `name` (original fields from the `Customers` collection that were carried through).

2.  **Partition by Transaction Type**: The filtered transactions are then grouped (partitioned) by their `transaction_type`.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Type**: For each transaction type group, we calculate:
    *   `num_distinct_customers`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`.

1.  **Filter Transactions by Date**: We start by selecting transactions that occurred within the specified date range. The `date_time` field will be used for this, ensuring we include transactions from January 1, 2023, up to and including March 31, 2023. We use `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"")` for the start and `DATETIME(""2023-04-01"")` for the exclusive end of the range.
2.  **Partition by Transaction Type**: The filtered transactions are then grouped (partitioned) by their `transaction_type`.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Type**: For each transaction type group, we calculate:
    *   `num_distinct_customers`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`.
    *   `avg_shares_val`: The average number of shares involved in transactions of this type. This is calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`.
    The partition key `transaction_type` is also carried forward as `transaction_type_val`.
4.  **Identify Top 3 Types**: We then select the top 3 transaction types based on the `num_distinct_customers`, ordered in descending order, using the `TOP_K` function.
5.  **Format Output**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to present the results with the requested field names: `transaction_type`, `number_of_distinct_customers`, and `average_number_of_shares`.

5.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select the `_id` of the filtered tickers, renaming it to `ticker_id` as requested. Since `_id` is unique for each ticker in the `Tickers` collection, the resulting list of `ticker_id`s will be distinct.

**Explanation:**

1.  `ticker_transaction_summary = Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`:

    *   It calculates `num_transactions` by counting all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection for each ticker.
    *   It also calculates `total_transaction_amount` by summing the `amount` field from all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.
    *   The original `symbol` field from `Tickers` is implicitly carried forward.

2.  `top_10_tickers_by_total_amount = ticker_transaction_summary.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `TOP_K(10, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the `ticker_transaction_summary` and selects the top 10 records based on the `total_transaction_amount` field, sorted in descending order.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=symbol, number_of_transactions=num_transactions, total_transaction_amount=total_transaction_amount)`: This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:
        *   The `symbol` field (carried from the original `Tickers` collection) and renames it to `ticker_symbol`.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter DailyPrices for 'VTI' and for the last 7 calendar days (today + 6 previous days)
vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (ticker.symbol == 'VTI') &

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.
        *   `<= 6` ensures the date is within the 6 days prior to today, or is today itself (0 days difference). This covers a total of 7 distinct calendar days.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final result at the top `Broker` level.
    *   `lowest_vti_close_price_past_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`: It computes the minimum value of the `close` field from the `vti_prices_last_7_days` collection.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `DailyPrices` collection, which contains daily stock price information.
    *   The `WHERE` clause applies two conditions:
        *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This filters the records to include only those where the associated `ticker` has a `symbol` of ""VTI"".
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This filters the records to the last 7 days. `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the price record's `date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`). A value of 0 means today, 1 means yesterday, and so on. So, `<= 6` includes records from today up to 6 days ago, covering a 7-day period.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We use `Broker.CALCULATE` (assuming `Broker` is the top-level graph object) to compute a single aggregated value.
    *   `lowest_closing_price_vti_past_7_days = MIN(filtered_vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`: This calculates the minimum (`MIN`) closing price (`close`) from the `filtered_vti_prices_last_7_days` collection obtained in the previous step. The result is assigned to a new field named `lowest_closing_price_vti_past_7_days`.

The final `result` will be a collection with a single row and a single column containing the lowest closing price for VTI in the specified period.

**Explanation:**

*   `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers who have at least one transaction recorded in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.

        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter this collection to include only customers who have at least one ""sell"" transaction recorded on the specific date ""2023-04-01"". We use the `HAS` function for this, checking the `transactions_made` sub-collection. The date is matched by comparing the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` of the `date_time` field.
3.  For the filtered customers, use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select the customer's `_id`.
    *   Select the customer's `name`.
    *   Calculate `number_of_transactions` by counting their ""sell"" transactions on ""2023-04-01"". This involves filtering the `transactions_made` sub-collection again by `transaction_type` and the specific date.
4.  Use `TOP_K(1, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())` to find the single customer with the highest `number_of_transactions`. If there's a tie, one of the top customers will be returned. If no customer made any such transactions, the result will be empty.

```python
result = Customers.WHERE(
    HAS(transactions_made.WHERE( # Check if the customer has any 'sell' transactions on the specified date
        (transaction_type == ""sell"") &

    *   `_id = _id`: Selects the customer's ID.
    *   `name = name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(...))`: Counts the number of ""sell"" transactions on ""2023-04-01"" for that customer. The `WHERE` clause here is identical to the one in `HAS` to ensure the count is for the correct set of transactions.
*   `.TOP_K(1, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`: This takes the resulting collection of customers (those who made at least one relevant transaction) and their transaction counts, then selects the top 1 customer based on `number_of_transactions` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_prepared = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions in January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""completed""`: Filters for successful transactions. **Note:** We are assuming ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction. If ""successful"" corresponds to a different value in the `status` field, this condition should be adjusted.
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time), transaction_price_val = price)`: This selects and prepares the data needed for the next steps. It creates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from `date_time`, and it selects the `price`, renaming it to `transaction_price_val` for clarity.

2.  `monthly_average_prices = transactions_prepared.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `transactions_prepared` data and groups it.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups"", by=(transaction_month)`: Partitions the data by the `transaction_month`. Each group will correspond to a unique month (1, 2, or 3).
    *   `.CALCULATE(month_num = transaction_month, avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val))`: For each monthly group, this calculates:
        *   `month_num = transaction_month`: The month number for the group.
        *   `avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val)`: The average of `transaction_price_val` for all transactions within that specific month's group.

3.  `result = monthly_average_prices.CALCULATE(...)`: This line formats the final output.
    *   `month = month_num`: Selects the month number.

    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Orders the final result by month in ascending order (January, February, March).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Transactions` collection.

2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, this step calculates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from the `date_time` field. This new field will be used as the key for partitioning. The original `price` field of the filtered transactions remains available for aggregation.

# aggregated weekly for the last 8 calendar weeks (excluding the current week).

# 1. Define Time Boundaries:
#    - `current_week_start_val`: Calculates the start date of the current week using DATETIME('now', 'start of week').
#    - `eight_weeks_ago_start_val`: Calculates the start date of the week that was 8 weeks before the current week's start.
#      This is done by taking the `current_week_start_val` and subtracting 8 weeks using DATETIME(..., '-8 weeks').

#    - Filter these processed payments using `WHERE`:
#        - Keep only payments whose `payment_week_start_date` falls within the defined 8-week window.

#        - `week`: This field takes the value of `payment_week_start_date` (the partition key), representing the start date of the week.
#        - `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments received in that week for the filtered sales. `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)` counts the relevant records within each partition.
#        - `weekend_payments_received`: The count of payments received on a weekend in that week. `SUM(IFF(is_weekend_payment_flag, 1, 0))` sums 1 for each payment where `is_weekend_payment_flag` is true.

#    - `current_week_start_val`: Calculates the start date of the current week using DATETIME('now', 'start of week').
#    - `eight_weeks_ago_start_val`: Calculates the start date of the week that was 8 weeks before the current week's start.
#      This is done by taking the `current_week_start_val` and subtracting 8 weeks using DATETIME(..., '-8 weeks').
#    These variables define the 8-week window of interest. Payments whose week start falls into the current week are excluded.
current_week_start_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')
eight_weeks_ago_start_val = DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-8 weeks')

# 2. Filter Sales and Access Payments:
#    - Start with the `Sales` collection.
#    - Filter these sales using `WHERE(sale_price > 30000)` to include only those with a sale price greater than $30,000.
#    - Access the `payment` sub-collection for these filtered sales. This sub-collection contains `PaymentsReceived` records.
payments_from_high_value_sales = Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000).payment

# 3. Process Payments and Filter by Relevant Weeks:
#    - For each payment obtained in the previous step:
#        - `CALCULATE` two new fields:
#            - `payment_week_start_date`: The start date of the calendar week in which the `payment_date` falls. This is determined using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`.
#            - `is_weekend_payment_flag`: A boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the `payment_date` was a Saturday or Sunday. This is checked using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
#    - Filter these processed payments using `WHERE`:
#        - Keep only payments whose `payment_week_start_date` falls within the defined 8-week window.
#          The condition is `(payment_week_start_date >= eight_weeks_ago_start_val) & (payment_week_start_date < current_week_start_val)`.
#          This ensures payments are from the 8 weeks prior to the current week.
payments_in_scope = payments_from_high_value_sales.CALCULATE(
    payment_week_start_date = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week'),
    is_weekend_payment_flag = ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))
).WHERE(
    (payment_week_start_date >= eight_weeks_ago_start_val) & (payment_week_start_date < current_week_start_val)
)

# 4. Aggregate Payments Weekly:
#    - `PARTITION` the `payments_in_scope` collection. The partition is named ""payments_per_week"" and is done `by=(payment_week_start_date)`.
#      This groups payments based on the week they belong to.
#    - For each weekly group, `CALCULATE` the required aggregates:
#        - `week`: This field takes the value of `payment_week_start_date` (the partition key), representing the start date of the week.
#        - `total_payments_received`: The total count of payments received in that week for the filtered sales. `COUNT(PaymentsReceived)` counts the relevant records within each partition.
#        - `weekend_payments_received`: The count of payments received on a weekend in that week. `SUM(IFF(is_weekend_payment_flag, 1, 0))` sums 1 for each payment where `is_weekend_payment_flag` is true.
weekly_payment_summary = payments_in_scope.PARTITION(name=""payments_per_week"", by=(payment_week_start_date)).CALCULATE(
    week = payment_week_start_date,
    total_payments_received = COUNT(PaymentsReceived),
    weekend_payments_received = SUM(IFF(is_weekend_payment_flag, 1, 0))
)

# 5. Order Results:
#    - Sort the `weekly_payment_summary` by the `week` start date in ascending order using `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())`.
#    - The final result is assigned to `final_result`.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: Calculate the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week analysis period (which is 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week). This is done at the `Dealership` (top-level graph) scope.
2.  **Filter Sales**: Select sales records where the `sale_price` is greater than $30,000. These calculations will have access to the date boundaries defined in step 1.
3.  **Access Payments**: For these filtered sales, access their associated `payment` records.
4.  **Filter Payments by Date**: Keep only those payments that fall within the 8-week analysis period. The period is from `analysis_period_start_dt` (inclusive) up to `current_week_start_dt` (exclusive).
5.  **Augment Payment Data**: For each payment in the analysis window:
    *   Calculate the start date of the week in which the payment occurred (`payment_week_start_date_attr`). This will serve as our weekly grouping key.
    *   Create a flag (`is_weekend_payment_attr`) which is 1 if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday, and 0 otherwise.
6.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the augmented payment data by `payment_week_start_date_attr`. For each week:
    *   Output the week start date as `week`.
    *   Count the total number of payments (`total_payments_received`).
    *   Sum the `is_weekend_payment_attr` flag to get the count of weekend payments (`weekend_payments_received`).
7.  **Order Results**: Sort the final summary by the `week` in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter `Cars`**:
    *   The query starts by selecting from the `Cars` collection.
    *   It filters these cars using `WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`. This condition selects cars where their `vin_number` contains 'M5'.
        *   `LOWER(vin_number)` converts the VIN number to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%m5%')` performs a partial match, finding 'm5' anywhere within the lowercase VIN number.

2.  **Partition by Car Model**:
    *   The filtered cars are then partitioned using `.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`.
    *   This groups the cars by unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group in `model_group` represents a distinct car model that met the VIN criteria.

3.  **Calculate Sales per Model**:
    *   Finally, `.CALCULATE(...)` is applied to each group created by the partition.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` of the car model (which is a partitioning key).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` of the car model (also a partitioning key).
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for each car model group.
        *   `Cars` within this `CALCULATE` refers to the sub-collection of cars belonging to the current (make, model) partition.
        *   `Cars.sale_records` accesses all sale records associated with these cars.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts these sale records to get the total number of sales for that specific car make and model.

        *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This condition ensures that we only consider sales where the `make` of the associated `car` (accessed via `Sales.car.make`) is ""Toyota"".
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This condition filters sales that occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 29` ensures that sales from today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago are included, covering a 30-day period.

2.  **`toyota_sales_summary = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use `Dealership.CALCULATE` to create a result with aggregated values. `Dealership` is the top-level collection representing the entire database context.
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(filtered_toyota_sales)`: This calculates the total number of sales that met the criteria defined in `filtered_toyota_sales` and assigns it to the field `number_of_sales`.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(filtered_toyota_sales.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in `filtered_toyota_sales` and assigns it to the field `total_revenue`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: Selects sales records where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`: Ensures that the `sale_date` occurred within the last 30 days (i.e., the difference in days between the `sale_date` and `DATETIME('now')` is 0, 1, ..., up to 29). This covers today and the 29 preceding days.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step:
    *   Select the `first_name` and `last_name` of the salesperson, aliasing them to temporary names (e.g., `sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`) because they will be used in a subsequent `CALCULATE`.

```
**Explanation:**

The query starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
-   `sp_first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
-   `sp_last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
-   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made` sub-collection).
-   `calculated_num_sales`: The count of all sales associated with the salesperson.

The second `CALCULATE` then uses these intermediate values to produce the final output:
-   `first_name`: Renamed from `sp_first_name`.
-   `last_name`: Renamed from `sp_last_name`.
-   `total_sales_amount`: Renamed from `calculated_total_sales`.
-   `number_of_sales`: Renamed from `calculated_num_sales`.
-   `SR`: The sales rank, calculated using the `RANKING()` function on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order. This means salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank number.

Finally, `ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())` sorts the resulting list of salespersons by their sales rank in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",44.36732244491577,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

1.  **Identify Cars with Known Inventory Status**: Start with the `Cars` collection. Filter for cars that have at least one entry in `inventory_snapshots`, as this is required to determine their latest inventory status. For each of these cars, calculate its make, model, and a boolean flag (`latest_inventory_status_bool`) indicating if it's currently in inventory based on its most recent snapshot. The most recent snapshot is found by ranking snapshots by `snapshot_date` in descending order and picking the top one.
2.  **Filter for Cars No Longer in Inventory**: From the above set of cars, filter further to retain only those where `latest_inventory_status_bool` is `False`. These are the cars confirmed to be no longer in inventory.
3.  **Get Sales Details for These Cars**: For the cars identified in step 2, access their `sale_records`. This effectively gives us all sales of cars that are confirmed to be no longer in inventory. For each sale, we extract the car's make and model (propagated from the parent car context) and the `sale_price` of that specific sale.
4.  **Group by Make and Model**: The resulting collection of individual sales (each with make, model, and price) is then partitioned by make and model.
5.  **Calculate Highest Sale Price per Group**: For each make/model group, calculate the maximum `sale_price` among all sales in that group.
6.  **Order and Format Output**: Finally, order these grouped results by the calculated maximum sale price in descending order. The final output will include the make, model, and the highest sale price.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and applying a filter.
2.  **` (LIKE(LOWER(make), ""%ford%"")) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), ""%mustang%"")) `**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%ford%"")`: Checks if the lowercase make name contains ""ford"". The `%` are wildcards, allowing ""ford"" to appear anywhere in the make name.
    *   `LIKE(..., ""%mustang%"")`: Checks if the lowercase model name contains ""mustang"".
    *   `|`: The logical OR operator, so cars matching either condition are included.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, this function is used to select the desired fields and calculate the average sale price for each car that met the criteria.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: These select the specified car details.
    *   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales for each car, and `sale_price` is a field within those sale records. The `AVG()` function aggregates these prices to compute the average for that specific car. If a car has no sales, the `avg_sale_price` will typically be null.",20.08211779594421,"car_details_and_avg_price = Cars.WHERE(

1.  Access the `Cars` collection.
2.  Filter these cars using a `WHERE` clause. The condition will check if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang', using the `LIKE` operator for partial and case-insensitive matching.
3.  For the filtered cars, use the `CALCULATE` method to:
    *   Select the `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, and `vin_number`.
    *   Calculate the average sale price for each car using `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`. The `sale_records` sub-collection links cars to their sales, and `sale_price` is a field in the `Sales` collection.

)
```
Explanation:
-   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    -   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""NewFord"", ""FordMotors"" would all match if ""ford"" is present). `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    -   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains ""mustang"".
    -   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'ford' OR its model contains 'mustang'.
-   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each car that meets the filter criteria, this function computes the specified output fields.
    -   `car_make=make`, `car_model=model`, `car_year=year`, `car_color=color`, `car_vin_number=vin_number`: These select the respective details of the car.
    -   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for the car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales associated with the car, and `sale_price` is the price from each sale.

1.  **Define the Reporting Period**: Calculate the start and end dates for the last 6 months, excluding the current month. The period starts 6 months prior to the beginning of the current month and ends at the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Create a Month Scaffold**: To ensure all relevant months appear in the result (even with zero metrics for specific salespersons), we first identify all unique months within this reporting period that had any sales activity globally. This is done by looking at all sales in the `Dealership.Sales` collection, filtering them by the reporting period, truncating their `sale_date` to the start of the month, and then finding the distinct months.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**: For each distinct month obtained from the scaffold:
    *   Identify sales made by salespersons who were hired between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023.
    *   Filter these sales to include only those that occurred within the specific month being processed.
    *   **PMSPS**: Count the number of such sales.
    *   **PMSR**: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales. If no such sales occurred, these metrics will correctly be 0.
4.  **Format and Order**: The month will be formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". The results will be ordered by month in ascending order.

This approach ensures that any month within the last six (excluding the current) that had at least one sale globally will be listed, and the PMSPS/PMSR for the specified salespersons in that month will be calculated (defaulting to 0 if no relevant sales).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`**:
    *   We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection because each payment record is directly associated with a sale and has a payment date.
    *   For each payment, we access its corresponding sale information via `sale_record`.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment. This difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_difference`.

2.  **`AVG(...)`**:
    *   The `AVG()` function then calculates the average of all the `days_difference` values computed in the previous step across all payment records.

3.  **`ROUND(..., 2)`**:
    *   The `ROUND()` function takes the calculated average and rounds it to 2 decimal places, as requested.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue for these sales by summing their `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost for these sales by summing the `cost` of the `car` associated with each sale.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.0`.
The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to yield a single GPM value.

    gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`:
    *   This line creates a contextless expression named `sales_in_2023`.
    *   It filters the `Sales` collection to retain only records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.

2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database graph (`Dealership`). This is suitable for calculating a single aggregate value for the entire dataset.

3.  `calculated_total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`:
    *   Inside the first `CALCULATE`, this defines `calculated_total_revenue`.
    *   It computes the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records present in the `sales_in_2023` collection (i.e., sales from 2023).

4.  `calculated_total_cost = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`:
    *   This defines `calculated_total_cost`.
    *   It computes the sum of the `cost` of the cars associated with each sale in `sales_in_2023`. `sales_in_2023.car` navigates from a sale record to its associated car record, and `car.cost` accesses the cost of that car.

5.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`:
    *   This second `CALCULATE` operates on the output of the first one (which is a single row containing `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost`).
    *   `gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost`:
        *   This line computes the Gross Profit Margin using the GPM formula provided: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
        *   `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost` (derived in the previous `CALCULATE` step) are used here.
        *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures that the division results in a floating-point number and the final value is expressed as a percentage.
        *   The final GPM value is assigned to a field named `gpm_2023`.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across all relevant sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For these filtered sales, it accesses their `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change as follows:

1.  **Extract Date Parts**: First, it processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, it extracts the `pay_year` (year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (month of `payment_date`) using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions, respectively. This augmented data is stored in `payments_with_date_parts`.

2.  **Aggregate Monthly Payments**:
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` method to group the records in `payments_with_date_parts` by `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
    *   For each unique year-month group, it calculates `total_payments_this_month` by summing up the `payment_amount` of all payments belonging to that group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`. The result is stored in `monthly_aggregated_payments`.

3.  **Calculate MoM Change**:
    *   On the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection (which contains one record per year/month with total payments), it calculates the `mom_change`.
    *   The `mom_change` is computed as `total_payments_this_month - PREV(total_payments_this_month, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()))`.
    *   The `PREV()` function retrieves the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding record, determined by ordering records by `year_val` (ascending) and then `month_val` (ascending).
    *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV()` will return `None` (as there's no preceding month), resulting in `mom_change` being `None` for that first month.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the `final_monthly_payments_report` is ordered by `year` and then `month` in ascending order for a clear and chronological presentation.

It's important to note that this query will only include months for which there is at least one payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.

5.  Calculate the `mom_change` as (`current month total_payments` - `previous month total_payments`). For the earliest month in the dataset, where there is no preceding month, the `PREV` function will use a default value of `0.0`, so its MoM change will be equal to its total payments.
6.  The results will be ordered by year and month.

We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current moment. If this difference is less than or equal to 6, it means the sale occurred today or in the preceding 6 days, covering a total of 7 days.

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    *   `<= 6`: This condition ensures that we include sales from today (0 days difference), yesterday (1 day difference), and so on, up to 6 days ago (6 days difference). This covers a total span of 7 days, inclusive of today.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` will give us the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_in_last_7_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to 'now'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is within the last 6 days from 'now' (inclusive of 'now', making it a 7-day window).
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only sales within this 7-day period are selected.
2.  `total_sales_count_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(TSC = COUNT(sales_in_last_7_days))`: This line calculates the final result.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start by accessing the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records)==1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    *   `sale_records` is the sub-collection within `Cars` that links to sales information.

    *   `HASNOT(sale_records) == 1` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection for each car is empty (i.e., the car has no associated sales records). It returns `True` (or `1`) if there are no sales records.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, make=make, model=model, year=year)`**:

3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=_id)`**: For each customer who passed the filter:
    *   We select their `_id` field, which represents the unique identifier for the customer.

   - We can navigate from a salesperson to all payments associated with all their sales using `sales_made.payment`.
   - We then filter these payments using `.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`.
   - The `HAS(...) == 1` function checks if there is at least one such cash payment for the salesperson.
3. For the salespersons who satisfy this condition, we use `CALCULATE` to select their `_id` and present it as `salesperson_id`. Since `_id` is unique for each salesperson, this will result in a distinct list of salesperson IDs.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code performs the following steps:

1.  **`Salespersons`**: It starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`**: This filters the salespersons.
    *   `sales_made.payment`: For each salesperson, this navigates through their `sales_made` (a list of `Sales` objects) and then to the `payment` attribute of each sale (a list of `PaymentsReceived` objects). This effectively gathers all payments associated with all sales made by the current salesperson.
    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`: This filters the collected payments, keeping only those where the `payment_method` is 'cash'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This checks if the filtered collection of cash payments is not empty (i.e., the salesperson has received at least one cash payment for any of their sales).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id)`**: For each salesperson who meets the `WHERE` condition, this step selects their `_id` field and renames it to `salesperson_id`.

    *   `== 1` ensures we select only those salespersons for whom `HASNOT(sales_made)` is true (i.e., they have no sales). This is conceptually similar to a left join where the right side (sales) is null.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function selects and renames the fields to be returned.

We then filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days from the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). `COUNT` then gives us the number of such sales.
    *   `total_recent_revenue=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30).sale_price), 0.0)`: Similarly, we filter the `sales_made` for the last 30 days and then `SUM` their `sale_price` to get the total revenue. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no recent sales, their revenue is 0.
2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=num_recent_sales.DESC())`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons. The ranking is based on `num_recent_sales` in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the most recent sales appear first.

4.  Order these car models by their total revenue in descending order.

Here's the PyDough code to achieve this:

```python

sales_with_car_details = Sales.CALCULATE(

# The result will contain make, model, total_revenue, and total_sales_count for the top 5 models.
result = top_5_models_by_revenue
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_car_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to create two new fields: `car_make_val` (from `Sales.car.make`) and `car_model_val` (from `Sales.car.model`). These fields will be used as keys for partitioning. The original `sale_price` from `Sales` is implicitly available for aggregation.
2.  `model_sales_summary = sales_with_car_details.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We `PARTITION` the `sales_with_car_details` collection using `car_make_val` and `car_model_val` as partition keys. This groups all sales by their car's make and model.
    *   Within each partition group (each unique make/model combination), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `make = car_make_val`: The make of the car model for this group.
        *   `model = car_model_val`: The model of the car for this group.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` of all sales records belonging to the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that specific car model.
        *   `total_sales_count = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make/model group, representing the total number of units sold for that car model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue = model_sales_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: We then take the `model_sales_summary` (which contains aggregated data per car model) and use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 entries. The sorting is done by `total_revenue` in descending order (`.DESC()`), so the models generating the most revenue are ranked highest.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car via the `car` relationship. These are aliased as `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model` to be used as partition keys.
2.  `grouped_by_model = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: The `sales_with_details` collection is then partitioned. The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by unique combinations of `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model`. Each group is named `sales_per_model_group`.
3.  `model_summary = grouped_by_model.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `make`: The car make (from the partition key `resolved_car_make`).
    *   `model`: The car model (from the partition key `resolved_car_model`).
    *   `total_number_of_sales`: The total count of sales for that specific make and model, obtained using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales of that specific make and model, obtained using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
4.  `top_models_by_revenue = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, `TOP_K` is applied to the `model_summary` to get the top 5 entries, ordered by `total_revenue` in descending order.

4.  Use `TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC(na_pos='last'))` to find the single salesperson with the minimum non-negative employment duration. `na_pos='last'` ensures any unexpected nulls are sorted last.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
    *   We'll calculate the start date (Monday) and end date (Sunday) of the week immediately preceding the current week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week.
    *   Subtracting 7 days from this gives the Monday of the previous week.
    *   Subtracting 1 day from the Monday of the current week gives the Sunday of the previous week.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated previous week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   Extract the calendar day from `payment_date` (by truncating it to the start of the day) to ensure daily aggregation.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for further processing.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered and prepared payments by the extracted calendar day and `payment_method`.
    *   For each group (each day and payment method combination), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.

5.  **Select and Order Results**:
    *   The final output will include the transaction date (day), the payment method, and the total amount for that combination.
    *   The results will be ordered by date and then by payment method for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.
        *   `payment_amount_from_data = payment_amount`: Aliases `payment_amount` for clarity.

3.  `result = payments_for_grouping.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_extracted, payment_method_from_data))`: This groups the `payments_for_grouping` data. Each group will consist of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_extracted` and have the same `payment_method_from_data`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `transaction_date = payment_day_extracted`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_type = payment_method_from_data`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_by_method = SUM(payments_for_grouping.payment_amount_from_data)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount_from_data` for all payments within the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(transaction_date.ASC(), payment_method_type.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the transaction date in ascending order, and then by payment method type, also in ascending order. This makes the output easy to read.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Access the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   Filter these payments to include only those made within the calculated date range of the previous ISO week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   For each filtered payment, extract the actual calendar day (`payment_actual_day_key`) using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. This ensures payments on the same day are grouped together, regardless of the time.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` as `payment_method_key` for grouping.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Use `PARTITION` to group the prepared payment records by `payment_actual_day_key` and `payment_method_key`.

1.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data**: We start with the `Sales` collection.
    *   Filter sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In a `CALCULATE` step, we retrieve the customer's state (`customer.state`) and determine the first date of the quarter for each sale. The quarter's first date (e.g., ""2023-01-01"" for Q1, ""2023-04-01"" for Q2, etc.) is calculated based on the `MONTH(sale_date)`. These derived fields will be used for partitioning.

2.  **Partition Data**: We then use the `PARTITION` method on the prepared sales data.
    *   The data is grouped by the calculated customer state (`customer_s`) and the quarter start date string (`quarter_dt_str`).

3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: Within each partition group (each unique combination of state and quarter):
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to output the customer's state and the quarter representation.
    *   We calculate the `total_quarterly_sales` by summing the `sale_price` of all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`. The `Sales.sale_price` here refers to the original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records that match the initial 2023 filter and fall into the current partition group.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by customer state and then by the quarter start date for better readability.

**Explanation:**

    *   `customer_s = customer.state`: Extracts the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `quarter_dt_str = IFF(...)`: Determines the first date of the quarter for the `sale_date`. For example, if a sale is in February 2023 (month 2), `quarter_dt_str` will be ""2023-01-01"".
*   `.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_sales_group"", by=(customer_s, quarter_dt_str))`: Groups the filtered sales data by the combination of the customer's state (`customer_s`) and the calculated quarter start date string (`quarter_dt_str`).
*   The second `.CALCULATE(...)` operates on each group created by the partition:

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters sales to include only those made in the year 2023.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` derives two new fields for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: Stores the `state` from the linked `customer` record.
        *   `q_start_date`: Determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. This is done using nested `IFF` functions based on the month of the sale. String literals like ""2023-01-01"" are used to represent these dates.

2.  `result = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`: Groups the records from `sales_info` based on unique combinations of `c_state` (customer state) and `q_start_date` (quarter start date).
    *   `.CALCULATE(customer_state=c_state, quarter_start_date=q_start_date, total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price))`: For each group created by the partition:
        *   `customer_state=c_state`: Selects the customer state for the output.
        *   `quarter_start_date=q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the output.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific state and quarter group. `Sales.sale_price` refers to the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records that fall into the current partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(customer_state.ASC(), quarter_start_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final result first by customer state in ascending order, and then by the quarter start date in ascending order. This ensures a structured and predictable output.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",60.105292320251465,"# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

6.  For these valid treatments, we calculate the DDD as `tot_drug_amt / duration_days`.

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Drugs` collection and use `CALCULATE` to output the `drug_name` and the computed `average_ddd` for each drug.
*   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
*   `average_ddd=AVG(...)`: Calculates the average DDD. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug.
*   `treatments_used_in.WHERE(...)`: Filters the treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `(HASNOT(end_dt) == 0)`: This condition ensures that `end_dt` (end date of the treatment) is not null. `HASNOT(field) == 0` means the field is present/not null.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0)`: This condition ensures that the treatment duration is positive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.
*   `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, this calculates its individual DDD.
    *   `ddd_for_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
*   `.ddd_for_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_treatment` value from the inner `CALCULATE` so that `AVG` can operate on these scalar DDD values. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria, `AVG` will likely return null.",41.831589460372925,"avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   We first establish the time window of interest: the last three full months, excluding the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt` marks the end of our window (exclusive).
    *   `three_months_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of our window (inclusive). These are calculated dynamically using `DATETIME('now', ...)` relative to the current date.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_in_period`)**:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the defined three-month window.
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered treatments:
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" is created from `start_dt` (e.g., ""2023-09"") to serve as a key for grouping treatments by month. `LPAD` ensures months are two digits (e.g., ""09"" instead of ""9"") for correct sorting.
        *   `p_id`: The `patient_id` is extracted.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment_flag`: A boolean flag is set to `True` if the treatment's associated drug (`drug.drug_type`) is 'biologic', and `False` otherwise.

3.  **Partition by Month and Aggregate (`monthly_aggregated_data`)**:
    *   The `treatments_in_period` data is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""treatments_per_month"", by=(treatment_month_year_key))`. This groups all treatments by their `treatment_month_year_key`.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes the required aggregates:
        *   `month_label`: This is the `treatment_month_year_key` (e.g., ""2023-09""), representing the month for which the counts are calculated.
        *   `distinct_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.p_id)` counts the number of unique patient IDs within that month's group. This gives the total number of distinct patients who received any treatment in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment_flag == True).p_id)` first filters the treatments within the monthly group to include only those where `is_biologic_treatment_flag` is `True`. Then, it counts the number of unique patient IDs from this subset. This gives the number of distinct patients who received at least one biologic drug treatment in that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We first establish the date boundaries for our analysis. `val_current_month_start` is the first day of the current month, and `val_three_months_ago_start` is the first day of the month three months prior to the current month. This defines a period covering the last three full calendar months.
2.  `treatments_in_relevant_period = date_info.Treatments.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection. The `date_info` values are available in this context.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters treatments to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within our defined three-month window.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, we create:
        *   `p_id`: An alias for `patient_id` for easier reference.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the treatment's drug (`Treatments.drug`) has a `drug_type` of 'biologic'.
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2023-04"") representing the month of the treatment, used for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month part is always two digits.
3.  `monthly_patient_stats = treatments_in_relevant_period.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We partition the `treatments_in_relevant_period` data using `treatment_month_year_key`. This groups all treatments by the month in which they started.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each monthly group:
        *   `month=treatment_month_year_key`: Outputs the month string.
        *   `patient_count=NDISTINCT(treatments_in_relevant_period.p_id)`: Counts the number of unique patient IDs (`p_id`) within that month's group. This gives the total distinct patients treated in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_count=NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(treatments_in_relevant_period.p_id, treatments_in_relevant_period.is_biologic_treatment == True))`: Counts the number of unique patient IDs for whom `is_biologic_treatment` was true at least once in that month. `KEEP_IF` effectively filters `p_id`s to only those associated with biologic treatments before `NDISTINCT` counts them.

    *   `start_date_inclusive = DATETIME(end_date_exclusive, '-6 months')` sets the lower bound to six months before the start of the current month.
2.  It filters the `Treatments` collection to get `treatments_in_period` which includes all treatments whose `start_dt` is on or after `start_date_inclusive` and before `end_date_exclusive`.
3.  It then filters `treatments_in_period` to get `alice_treatments_in_period` by checking if the associated `patient.first_name` is ""Alice"".
4.  Finally, it uses `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to count the number of treatments in `alice_treatments_in_period` and assigns this count to `num_treatments_for_alice`.",31.213905572891235,"# Define the start and end dates for the period of interest

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This defines the beginning of our 6-month window. It calculates the date corresponding to the start of the month that was six months ago from the current date.
2.  `end_date_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This defines the end of our window (exclusive). It's the start of the current month, so treatments must occur before this date.
3.  `alice_treatments = Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"").treatments_received`: This line first filters the `Patients` collection to find all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"". Then, it accesses their `treatments_received` sub-collection.
4.  `treatments_in_defined_period = alice_treatments.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `treatments_received` for Alice(s) to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within our defined period:
    *   `start_dt >= start_date_period`: The treatment started on or after the beginning of the 6-month window.
    *   `start_dt < end_date_period`: The treatment started before the current month.
5.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(num_treatments_for_alice = COUNT(treatments_in_defined_period))`: Finally, this calculates the total count of the filtered treatments and assigns it to the field `num_treatments_for_alice`.

1.  First, we'll start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve `doc_id`, `speciality`, and compute `num_distinct_drugs`. The `num_distinct_drugs` is calculated by counting the distinct drug IDs from the `drug` associated with each doctor's `prescribed_treatments`. This new collection is named `doctors_with_drug_counts`.
3.  Next, we `PARTITION` the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection by `speciality`. We name these partitions `specialty_group`.
4.  After partitioning, we access the items within each `specialty_group` (which are the records from `doctors_with_drug_counts` belonging to that specialty).
5.  On these items, we use another `CALCULATE` to select the final fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`.
6.  In this final `CALCULATE`, we also compute `SDRSDR`. This is done using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `per=""specialty_group""` (meaning within each specialty), ordered by `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (so doctors prescribing more distinct drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., rank 1).

2.  **Partition by Specialty**: We'll group the doctors based on their `speciality`. This allows us to perform ranking within each specialty group.
3.  **Rank Doctors within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, we'll calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`).

    *   Convert `first_name` to lowercase using `LOWER()` and check if it starts with 'j' using `STARTSWITH()`.
    *   Convert `last_name` to lowercase using `LOWER()` and check if it contains 'son' using `CONTAINS()`.
    *   Combine these two conditions using the OR operator (`|`).
3.  Use `CALCULATE` to select the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `speciality` fields for the filtered doctors.

```python
filtered_doctors = Doctors.WHERE(
    (STARTSWITH(LOWER(first_name), 'j')) | (CONTAINS(LOWER(last_name), 'son'))
).CALCULATE(
    doc_first_name=first_name,
    doc_last_name=last_name,
    doc_speciality=speciality

2. Filter the doctors where either their first name (converted to lowercase) starts with 'j' OR their last name (converted to lowercase) contains 'son'.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the date range. This involves determining the start of the current month and the start of the month 12 months prior. The period of interest will be from 12 months ago up to (but not including) the start of the current month.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select `Treatments` whose `start_dt` falls within this calculated 12-month period.
3.  **Extract Year and Month**: For each filtered treatment, we create a standardized year-month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") from the `start_dt`. This will be used for grouping.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the treatments based on this year-month string.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD**: For each month, we count the number of unique patients who received a diagnosis. Since each treatment is associated with a patient and a diagnosis, this is `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`.
    *   **PMTC**: For each month, we count the total number of treatments, which is `COUNT(Treatments)`.
6.  **Order Results**: The final results are ordered by the year-month string to display them chronologically.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by calculating two key dates at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level:
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `twelve_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month that was 12 months before the current month.
2.  `relevant_treatments = date_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter them. A treatment is included if its `start_dt` is on or after `twelve_months_ago_start_dt` AND before `current_month_start_dt`. This effectively selects all treatments from the last 12 full months, excluding any from the current month.
3.  `treatments_with_month_year = relevant_treatments.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these `relevant_treatments`, we create a new field `treatment_month_year_str`. This string is formatted as ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2023-01"") by combining the year and the zero-padded month of the `start_dt`. This format is crucial for correct grouping and sorting.
4.  `monthly_metrics = treatments_with_month_year.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition (group) these treatments by the `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
    *   `month_year = treatment_month_year_str`: This carries over the year-month label for the output.
    *   `PMPD = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: This calculates the ""Per Month Patient Diagnoses"" by counting the number of unique `patient_id`s within each month's group of treatments. This assumes that each treatment implies a diagnosis for the patient.
    *   `PMTC = COUNT(Treatments)`: This calculates the ""Per Month Treatment Count"" by counting all treatments within that month's group.
6.  `result = monthly_metrics.ORDER_BY(month_year.ASC())`: Finally, the aggregated monthly metrics are ordered chronologically by the `month_year` string.",33.92883086204529,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the month 12 months prior

We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the first day of the current month and `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-12 months')` to get the first day of the month 12 months ago.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select `Treatments` that have a `start_dt` falling within this 12-month window.
3.  **Extract Year and Month**: For each filtered treatment, we extract the `YEAR` and `MONTH` from its `start_dt`. These will be used for grouping.
4.  **Partition Data**: We partition the treatments by the extracted `treatment_year_for_grouping` and `treatment_month_for_grouping`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month and year.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each month-year group, we count the number of unique patients who received a treatment (and thus a diagnosis, as treatments link patients to diagnoses). This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each month-year group, we count the total number of treatments. This is calculated using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
6.  **Format and Order**: The results are ordered by year and month. We then format a `year_month_str` string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") for readability and select the final PMPD and PMTC values.

4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function is used here. For the earliest year in the data, NPI will be `None` as there's no preceding year for comparison.

Here's the PyDough code:

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year. If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the data), `PREV` returns `None`, making the `npi` also `None`.",88.72593855857849,"# Step 1: Access treatments for each patient and rank them by start date

2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: We group the patients by their ""first treatment year"" and count how many unique patients fall into each year. This gives us the number of new patients for each year.
3.  **Order by Year**: The yearly counts of new patients are then ordered chronologically by year. This is necessary for the next step, which involves comparing with the previous year.
4.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI (New Patients Increase) is calculated as the number of new patients in the current year minus the number of new patients in the previous year.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`: This line starts with the `Patients` collection. It filters out patients who have no treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`. Then, for each remaining patient, it calculates `year_of_first_treatment` by finding the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` among all their `treatments_received` and extracting the year from that date.
2.  `new_patients_by_year`: This takes `patient_first_treatment_info` and partitions it by `year_of_first_treatment`. For each year group, it calculates:
    *   `year_val`: The year of the group.
    *   `num_new_patients_val`: The count of patients whose first treatment occurred in `year_val`. `COUNT(Patients)` counts the items (which originated from the `Patients` collection) within each partition.
3.  `ordered_new_patients_by_year`: This sorts the `new_patients_by_year` collection in ascending order based on `year_val`. This chronological ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function used in the next step.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` step produces the desired output:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `number_of_new_patients`: The count of new patients in that year.
    *   `NPI`: The New Patients Increase. This is calculated by subtracting the previous year's `num_new_patients_val` (obtained using `PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's `num_new_patients_val`. The `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the data, the NPI is simply the number of new patients for that year (as `current_value - 0`).",61.62909936904907,"# Step 1: For each patient, determine the year of their first treatment.

1.  **Filter Relevant Outcomes**: We first identify the outcome records that have non-null PASI scores for both day 7 (`day7_pasi_score`) and day 100 (`day100_pasi_score`). This is crucial because the D7D100PIR calculation relies on both these values. We use `HAS(field_name) == 1` to check for non-null values.
2.  **Calculate Global Average PASI Scores**:
    *   Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` across all the filtered outcome records.
    *   Compute the average `day100_pasi_score` across all the filtered outcome records.
    These calculations are performed at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level to get overall averages.
3.  **Apply the D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the calculated global averages in the provided formula:
    `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
    Multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and maintains floating-point precision.

77,Which drug had the highest number of adverse events reported within the same month as the treatment start date (adverse event or treatment can be earlier than the other)? Return the number of adverse events along with the drug's _id and name.,"WITH adverse_events_per_drug AS (SELECT d.drug_id, COUNT(ae._id) AS num_events FROM adverse_events AS ae JOIN treatments AS t ON ae.treatment_id = t.treatment_id AND strftime('%Y-%m', ae.reported_dt) = strftime('%Y-%m', t.start_dt) JOIN drugs AS d ON t.drug_id = d.drug_id GROUP BY d.drug_id) SELECT ae.drug_id, d.drug_name, ae.num_events FROM adverse_events_per_drug AS ae JOIN drugs AS d USING (drug_id) ORDER BY ae.num_events DESC LIMIT 1;",DermTreatment,"The problem asks us to identify the drug that had the highest number of adverse events reported in the same calendar month as the treatment start date. We need to return the drug's ID, name, and this count of adverse events.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to calculate the total number of relevant adverse events. This total will be a sum over all treatments associated with that drug.
3.  For each `treatment` associated with a drug (via `treatments_used_in`):
    a.  Determine the year and month of the treatment's `start_dt`. We'll create intermediate fields `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` for this.
    b.  Access the `adverse_events` for this specific treatment.
    c.  Filter these adverse events to include only those where the `reported_dt` falls within the same year and month as the treatment's `start_dt` (i.e., `YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr` and `MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth`).
    d.  Count these filtered adverse events for the current treatment. Let's call this `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`.
4.  Sum these counts (`count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`) across all treatments for the current drug. This gives the total number of relevant adverse events for the drug, which we'll call `num_adv_events`.
5.  After calculating `num_adv_events` for every drug, use `TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())` to find the drug with the highest count.
6.  The final result should include the drug's ID (`drug_id`), name (`drug_name`), and the calculated `num_adv_events`.

This requires nested calculations: an outer `CALCULATE` on `Drugs` to compute `num_adv_events`, and inner `CALCULATE` operations on `treatments_used_in` to determine the count for each treatment before summing them up. Due to the rule that new fields defined in a `CALCULATE` are only available after it completes, we'll need two chained `CALCULATE` calls on `treatments_used_in`.

```python
result = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    d_id = drug_id,
    d_name = drug_name,
    num_adv_events = SUM(
        treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(

            treatment_start_yr = YEAR(start_dt),
            treatment_start_mth = MONTH(start_dt)
        ).CALCULATE(
            # For each treatment (now with treatment_start_yr and treatment_start_mth available),
            # count its adverse events that occurred in the same month and year as the treatment start_dt

                adverse_events.WHERE(

        ).count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment # This is the value to be summed for the current drug
    )

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `d_id = drug_id`: Selects the drug's ID.
    *   `d_name = drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
    *   `num_adv_events = SUM(...)`: This calculates the total number of relevant adverse events for the current drug. The `SUM` function aggregates counts derived from each associated treatment.

2.  `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`: This first inner `CALCULATE` operates on the collection of treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `treatment_start_yr = YEAR(start_dt)`: Extracts the year from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_mth = MONTH(start_dt)`: Extracts the month from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    These fields (`treatment_start_yr`, `treatment_start_mth`) are now available for the subsequent `CALCULATE`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second inner `CALCULATE` (chained after the first one on `treatments_used_in`) still operates on each treatment.
    *   `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment = COUNT(...)`: For each treatment, this counts its adverse events that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   `adverse_events.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `adverse_events` sub-collection of the current treatment.
        *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth)`: This condition ensures that the adverse event's `reported_dt` is in the same calendar month and year as the treatment's `start_dt`.

4.  `.count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`: This refers to the result of the `COUNT` operation from the second inner `CALCULATE`. The `SUM` function in the outer `CALCULATE` (on `Drugs`) aggregates these per-treatment counts to get the total for the drug.

5.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())`: After calculating `d_id`, `d_name`, and `num_adv_events` for all drugs, this function selects the single drug that has the highest `num_adv_events`, ordering in descending order.",51.85069966316223,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type`: This line starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)` filters these treatments to include only those that ended in the year 2022.
    *   `.CALCULATE(derived_ins_type = patient.ins_type)` creates a new temporary field `derived_ins_type` for each treatment, which holds the insurance type of the patient associated with that treatment. This field is necessary for partitioning in the next step.

2.  `partitioned_by_insurance`: This takes the previously prepared `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(derived_ins_type))` groups the treatments based on the `derived_ins_type`. Each group (partition) will contain all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.

3.  `insurance_type_metrics`: This operates on the `partitioned_by_insurance` data.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes aggregate values for each insurance type group:
        *   `insurance_type = derived_ins_type`:  This selects the insurance type (which was the partition key) for the output, renaming it to `insurance_type`.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: This calculates the average `day100_pasi_score`. The `AVG` function operates on all `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: This counts the number of unique patient IDs among the treatments in the current insurance type group.

2.  Filter the `Treatments` collection based on three conditions combined with an AND (`&`) operator:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` must contain 'psoriasis'. This is achieved by converting the `diag_name` to lowercase using `LOWER()` and then using the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'%psoriasis%'` for a case-insensitive wildcard match.
    *   **Drug Approval Condition**: The `drug` used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. This is checked by verifying that the `fda_appr_dt` field in the associated `drug` record exists (is not null) using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The `end_dt` of the treatment must be within the last 6 months from today. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to ""6 months ago"" and less than or equal to ""today"".
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions using the `COUNT()` aggregation function.

2.  **`num_treatments = COUNT(...)`**: We are counting the number of treatments that satisfy the specified conditions and assigning it to the field `num_treatments`.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Treatments` collection based on a series of conditions combined with logical AND (`&`).
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition checks the diagnosis associated with each treatment.
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment.
        *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for a case-insensitive match.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Performs a wildcard search, matching if 'psoriasis' is a substring of the lowercase diagnosis name.
    *   **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This condition ensures the drug used in the treatment is FDA-approved.
        *   `drug.fda_appr_dt`: Accesses the FDA approval date of the drug linked to the treatment.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the `fda_appr_dt` field is present and not null, implying the drug has an FDA approval date.
    *   **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   **`end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`**: This condition checks if the treatment's end date (`end_dt`) is within the last 6 months.
        *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
        *   The treatment must have ended on or after this calculated date.
    *   **`end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`**: This ensures the treatment end date is not in the future, effectively meaning it ended on or before the current moment.

```
**Explanation:**

*   We start by querying the `AdverseEvents` collection.
*   The `WHERE` clause filters these events based on their timing relative to the treatment start date:
    *   `treatment.start_dt` refers to the `start_dt` field of the `Treatments` record associated with the adverse event.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)` calculates the number of full days between the treatment start date and the adverse event's reported date.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt) >= 1)` ensures the adverse event occurred at least one full day *after* the treatment started.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt) <= 10)` ensures the adverse event occurred no more than 10 full days after the treatment started.
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only events meeting both criteria are included.
*   The `CALCULATE` clause then selects and renames the required fields:
    *   `treatment_id` is taken from the associated treatment record.
    *   `treatment_start_date` is the `start_dt` from the associated treatment record.
    *   `adverse_event_date` is the `reported_dt` of the adverse event.
    *   `adverse_event_description` is the `description` of the adverse event.",36.37225651741028,"adverse_events_within_10_days_after_start = AdverseEvents.WHERE(

For each such pair, it retrieves the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates of the concomitant medication.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE(is_placebo == True)` to select only placebo treatments.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each selected placebo treatment.
4.  A second `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications. The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures that only medications started on or up to 14 days after the parent treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`) are included. `start_dt` here refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `concomitant_med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from its own `start_dt` field).
    *   `concomitant_med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication (from its own `end_dt` field).

Each row in the output will correspond to a specific concomitant medication that satisfies the conditions, along with details of its parent placebo treatment.

For these identified treatments, the query should return the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates for *all* concomitant medications associated with these treatments (not just the ones meeting the two-week condition).

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Define the Date Condition**: A contextless expression `med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment` is defined. This condition checks if a concomitant medication's `start_dt` is on or after the parent treatment's `start_dt` and no more than 14 days after it. `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the medication's start and the treatment's start.
2.  **Select Qualifying Treatments**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is filtered first for `is_placebo == True`.
    *   It's further filtered using `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment)) == 1`. This ensures that only treatments having at least one concomitant medication satisfying the defined date condition are selected. The result is stored in `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`.
3.  **Retrieve Desired Information**:
    *   From `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`, we navigate to their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This will include *all* concomitant medications for the selected treatments.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function is then used to specify the output fields:
        *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the treatment (from the parent `Treatments` record).
        *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the treatment.
        *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the treatment.
        *   `med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from the current `ConcomitantMeds` record).
        *   `med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

This approach ensures that if a placebo treatment meets the criteria (having at least one med starting within 2 weeks), then all of its concomitant medications are listed along with the treatment details.

```python
# Define the condition for a concomitant med starting within 2 weeks of treatment start
# This means the med_start_dt is between treatment_start_dt and treatment_start_dt + 14 days (inclusive)
med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment = (
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) &

)

# First, select treatments that are placebo and have at least one concomitant med meeting the date criteria
selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds = Treatments.WHERE(
    (is_placebo == True) &

)

Explanation:
-   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want to compute a single aggregated value over the entire dataset.
-   `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'private'))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only male patients who have 'private' insurance. We assume 'private' is the value stored in the `ins_type` field for private insurance.
-   `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age.
    -   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This effectively gives the age in integer years.
    -   The result of this calculation is stored in a temporary field `current_age_in_years`.
-   `.current_age_in_years`: This accesses the calculated ages for the `AVG` function.
-   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients who met the filter criteria.
-   `ROUND(..., 0)`: This rounds the calculated average age to 0 decimal places, effectively providing an integer result as requested.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions where `status == ""completed""` are successful and that these are typically `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Calculate the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This will be the numerator for CPUR. We'll use `NDISTINCT` on the `coupon_id` field of the successful transactions.
4.  Calculate the total number of distinct successful transactions. This will be the denominator for CPUR. We'll use `COUNT` on the successful transactions.
5.  Compute CPUR as `(number of distinct coupons used) / (number of distinct transactions)`.
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
7.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

This is achieved using a two-step `CALCULATE`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
2.  `merchant_name=name`: We select the merchant's name.
3.  `num_distinct_coupons = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`:
    *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(status == ""completed"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those marked as ""completed"" (assumed to be successful).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` for each of these successful transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions. This gives the number of distinct coupons used.
4.  `num_distinct_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`:
    *   This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the results from the first:
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant name.
    *   `CPUR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_transactions > 0, ...)`: This checks if there are any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons / num_distinct_successful_transactions`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the total number of successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `current_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `three_weeks_prior_start_dt`: Calculates the start date of the week that was three weeks before the current week using `DATETIME(current_week_start_dt, '-3 weeks')`. This marks the beginning of our 3-week analysis window.

2.  **Filter Users**:
    *   `users_from_us_canada = Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`: Selects users whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.

3.  **Prepare Notifications Data**:
    *   `users_from_us_canada.notifications`: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for the filtered users.
    *   `.CALCULATE(notification_week_start_val = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week'))`: For each notification, it calculates `notification_week_start_val`, which is the date of the start of the week in which the notification was created. This aligns with the requirement to ""Truncate created\_at to week for aggregation"".

4.  **Filter Notifications by Time Window**:
    *   `relevant_period_notifications = ... .WHERE((notification_week_start_val >= three_weeks_prior_start_dt) & (notification_week_start_val < current_week_start_dt))`: Filters the notifications to include only those whose `notification_week_start_val` falls within the last three full weeks. The range is inclusive of `three_weeks_prior_start_dt` and exclusive of `current_week_start_dt`.

5.  **Group Notifications by Week**:
    *   `notifications_grouped_by_week = relevant_period_notifications.PARTITION(name=""notifications_in_week_group"", by=(notification_week_start_val))`: Groups the filtered notifications by their `notification_week_start_val`. Each group will represent a unique week.

6.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_start_for_group = notification_week_start_val`: Selects the week's start date (the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications within that weekly group. `Notifications` here refers to the original notification records belonging to the current group.
        *   `weekend_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))))`: Counts notifications within that weekly group that were created on a 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'. `DAYNAME(created_at)` extracts the name of the day of the week from the notification's `created_at` timestamp.

7.  **Order Results**:
    *   `final_weekly_summary = weekly_notification_counts.ORDER_BY(week_start_for_group.ASC())`: Orders the final results by the week start date in ascending order for readability.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_context`: We start by calculating `current_week_start_ts` (the timestamp for the beginning of the current week) at the `Ewallet` (graph) level. This provides a stable reference for date calculations.
2.  `notifications_with_week_info`:
    *   We access `Users` and filter for those in the ""US"" or ""CA"".
    *   Then, we access their `notifications`.
    *   For each notification, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start date of the week the notification was created, effectively truncating `created_at` to the week.
        *   `is_weekend_notification_flag`: A flag (1 if true, 0 if false) indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME()`.
        *   `num_weeks_ago`: The difference in full weeks between the notification's week and the `current_week_start_ts`.
3.  `relevant_notifications_for_period`: We filter the above results to keep only notifications where `num_weeks_ago` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_notification_summary` (assigned to `result`):
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_notifications_for_period` by `notification_actual_week_start`. This groups notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for which the counts are being reported.
        *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications sent in that week (achieved by `COUNT(Notifications)` within the partition group).
        *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications sent on a weekend during that week (achieved by `SUM(is_weekend_notification_flag)` over the items in the partition group).
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.",59.35386157035828,"# Step 1: Calculate the start of the current week for reference.

2.  Access the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for these US users to get all transactions they initiated.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days. This is achieved by comparing the transaction's `created_at` date with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) using the `DATEDIFF` function. A transaction is within the last 7 days inclusive if the difference in days is less than or equal to 6.
4.  Finally, use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to compute two aggregates on this filtered set of transactions:
    *   The total number of transactions, using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of the `amount` for these transactions, using `SUM()`.

# Calculate the number of these transactions and their total amount
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions = COUNT(relevant_transactions),
    total_transaction_amount = SUM(relevant_transactions.amount)
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first defines `relevant_transactions`. This is achieved by:
- Starting with the `Users` collection.
- Filtering for users where `country == ""US""`.
- Accessing their sent transactions via the `transactions_sent` relationship.
- Further filtering these transactions to include only those where the `created_at` date is within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). The `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` condition ensures this:
    - If a transaction was today, `DATEDIFF` is 0.
    - If a transaction was 6 days ago, `DATEDIFF` is 6.
    - Both satisfy `<= 6`. Transactions 7 days ago or older will have a `DATEDIFF` of 7 or more, thus excluded.

Once `relevant_transactions` is defined, the `Ewallet.CALCULATE` function is used to compute the final aggregates:
- `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions in the `relevant_transactions` collection.
- `total_transaction_amount`: Sums the `amount` field of all transactions in the `relevant_transactions` collection.

The final output, stored in the `result` variable, will be a single record containing these two calculated values.",45.17957639694214,"# Identify transactions made by US users within the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

3.  Filter these transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`.

This covers today (0 days diff) and the 6 preceding days, totaling 7 days.
4.  Calculate the total count of these filtered transactions using `COUNT()`.

The definition provided is ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". The final result should be a single value representing this average AMB, labeled as ""average_balance"".

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter Recent Balances**: It first filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of 7 days ago. This is done using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7`.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**:
    *   The filtered balances are then partitioned by `user_id`. This groups all recent balance entries for each user.
    *   For each user group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute `user_specific_amb = AVG(UserBalances.balance)`. This calculates the average balance for each specific user based on their balance entries from the past week, fulfilling the definition of AMB for that user over the specified period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, it calculates the average of all these `user_specific_amb` values. This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `user_specific_amb` field from the collection generated in the previous step. The result is stored in a field named `average_balance`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for entries updated in the past week (inclusive of 7 days ago).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each user.
    *   `user_id=uid`: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and name it `user_id` in the output.

2.  **`latest_user_balance=Users.balances.WHERE(...)`**: This part calculates the latest balance for the current user.
    *   `Users.balances`: For each user, this accesses their list of balance records (from the `UserBalances` collection).
    *   **`WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This window function is applied to the user's balances.
            *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: It ranks the balances based on the `updated_at` timestamp in descending order, so the most recent balance gets rank 1.
            *   `per=""Users""`: This ensures that the ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
        *   `== 1`: We filter the balances to keep only the one that has rank 1 (i.e., the most recent one).
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause (with `RANKING ... == 1`) is expected to return exactly one balance record for each user (their latest), `SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record context. This allows us to access its fields directly.
    *   **`.balance`**: From the singular latest balance record, we extract the actual `balance` value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: Stores the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category_val=category`: Stores the merchant's category.
    *   `revenue_val=SUM(...)`: This calculates the total revenue for the merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions received by the current merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: This filters these transactions to include only those that are ""completed"" and where the `receiver_type` is `1` (as specified for merchants).
        *   `.amount`: This accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.
        *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the amounts of these filtered transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant. If a merchant has no such transactions, `SUM` is expected to yield 0.

2.  `merchant_revenue_data.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first step and produces the final output.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: Assigns the stored merchant name to the output field `merchant_name`.
    *   `category=merchant_category_val`: Assigns the stored merchant category to the output field `category`.
    *   `revenue_amount=revenue_val`: Assigns the calculated revenue to the output field `revenue_amount`.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_val.DESC())`: This calculates the rank for each merchant.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: This is a window function that assigns a rank.
        *   `by=revenue_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the `revenue_val` calculated in the previous step, in descending order (so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1). This rank is assigned to the `revenue_rank` field.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Access Merchants**: We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  **Calculate Revenue**: For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue.
    *   This involves accessing their `transactions_received`.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those that were `successfully received`. This means the transaction `status` must be 'completed'.
    *   Additionally, the problem specifies to filter for `receiver_type=1` for merchants. So, we add this condition to the transaction filter.
    *   We then `SUM` the `amount` of these filtered transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant.
3.  **Rank Merchants**: After calculating the revenue for all merchants, we rank them.
    *   The ranking is based on the calculated revenue, in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).
4.  **Select Output Fields**: Finally, we select the merchant's name, category, their calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate revenue for each merchant from their successfully received transactions.
# We filter transactions by status 'completed' and receiver_type 1.
merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    merch_name=name,
    merch_category=category,
    # Calculate total revenue from transactions_received that are completed and have receiver_type = 1
    revenue_value=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)
)

# Step 2: Rank merchants based on the calculated revenue and select the final output fields.
# Merchants with higher revenue get a lower rank number (Rank 1 is highest).

    merchant_name=merch_name,
    category=merch_category,
    revenue_amount=revenue_value,
    revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_value.DESC())
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `merch_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name and renames it to `merch_name`.
    *   `merch_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category and renames it to `merch_category`.
    *   `revenue_value=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   This calculates the total revenue for each merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is 'completed' (indicating a successful transaction) AND `receiver_type` is 1 (as specified for merchants).
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Sums up these amounts to get the total `revenue_value` for the merchant.

2.  `mrr_calculation = merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the result from the previous step (`merchant_revenues_calc`).
    *   `merchant_name=merch_name`: Selects the previously calculated `merch_name`.
    *   `category=merch_category`: Selects the previously calculated `merch_category`.
    *   `revenue_amount=revenue_value`: Selects the calculated `revenue_value` and renames it to `revenue_amount` for the final output.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_value.DESC())`:
        *   This calculates the rank for each merchant based on their `revenue_value`.
        *   `by=revenue_value.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be done on the `revenue_value` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average number of daily active users over a month.
An active user on a given day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` with `sender_type = 0` who made a transaction on that day.

The calculation covers the last two full months, excluding the current month. For example, if the current month is July, the query will calculate PMDAU for May and June.

The process involves these main steps:
1.  **Define Date Range**: Establish the period of interest, which starts from the first day of the month two months prior to the current month and ends just before the start of the current month.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this defined date range and have a `sender_type` of 0.
3.  **Prepare Data for Daily Aggregation**: For each filtered transaction, extract or calculate:
    *   `calc_year_month`: The start of the month in which the transaction occurred (e.g., '2023-05-01' for any transaction in May 2023). This is used for the final monthly grouping.
    *   `calc_day_date`: The start of the day on which the transaction occurred (e.g., '2023-05-15 00:00:00' for a transaction on May 15th, 2023). This is used for grouping by day.
    *   `calc_sender_id`: The `sender_id` from the transaction.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transaction data by `calc_year_month` and `calc_day_date`.
    *   For each unique day (each group), count the number of distinct `calc_sender_id` values. This count represents the DAU for that specific day. The resulting collection, `daily_active_user_counts`, will contain records each representing a day, its month, and its DAU.
5.  **Calculate Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU)**:
    *   Group the `daily_active_user_counts` (from step 4) by `grouped_year_month` (which is the `calc_year_month` carried forward).
    *   For each month, calculate the average of all `daily_dau` values associated with that month. This average is the PMDAU for that month.
6.  **Format Final Output**: Present the results with columns for the month (`month`) and the calculated PMDAU (`pmdau`), ordered chronologically by month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition (`ewallet_context_vars`):**
    *   `calc_start_of_target_period`: Determines the start date for transactions. It's set to the first day of the month that is two months before the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be May 1st).
    *   `calc_end_of_target_period`: Determines the end date (exclusive). It's set to the first day of the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be July 1st, so transactions up to June 30th are included).
    *   This ensures the query considers transactions from the last two full months, excluding the current month.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`filtered_transactions`):**
    *   Selects transactions from the `Ewallet.Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters for transactions where `sender_type == 0`, as specified for active users.
    *   Applies the date range calculated in the previous step (`created_at >= calc_start_of_target_period` and `created_at < calc_end_of_target_period`).

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`transactions_for_monthly_aggregation`):**
    *   From the filtered transactions, it extracts the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of `created_at` into `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This effectively ""truncates created_at to month for aggregation.""
    *   `sender_id` is aliased to `user_sender_id` for clarity.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`):**
    *   The prepared transaction data is partitioned by `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This groups all transaction records by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `pmdau_year`: The year of the report.
        *   `pmdau_month`: The month of the report.
        *   `pmdau_value`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(user_sender_id)`. This count represents the number of unique users (senders with `sender_type = 0`) who were active (made at least one transaction) during that specific month.

5.  **Result:**
    *   The final output (`result`) will contain rows for each of the two target months, with the corresponding year, month, and the calculated PMDAU value (which, by this interpretation, is the count of unique active senders in that month).",101.31816959381104,"# Define date boundaries globally.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection to process each user.
2.  For each user, calculate the sum of durations of their sessions that fall within the specified date range.
    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).
    *   Filter these sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01T00:00:00"" and before ""2023-06-08T00:00:00"".
    *   For each filtered session, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`.
    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).
5.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested.

```python
# Calculate total session duration for each user within the specified date range

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each user in the `Users` collection.
    *   `user_id_val = uid`: We store the user's unique identifier (`uid`) as `user_id_val`.
    *   `total_duration_val = SUM(...)`: For each user, we calculate the sum of session durations.
        *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the user's `sessions` (which are `UserSessions` records linked to this user) and filter them based on the `session_start_ts` to include only those within the range \[2023-06-01 00:00:00, 2023-06-08 00:00:00).
        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We also need to retain the `user_id` for grouping.

5.  Select the `user_id` and this total session duration.
6.  Order the final result by the total session duration in descending order.

The `user_id` from the `UserSessions` table will be used as the user identifier. The duration will be an integer as `DATEDIFF` returns an integer and `SUM` of integers is an integer.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable holds sessions that fall within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_duration_seconds` (the duration of that single session in seconds) and keeps `session_user_id` (the `user_id` associated with the session).
2.  `user_total_session_durations`: This takes `sessions_with_duration` and groups them by `session_user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each unique user), it calculates:
    *   `user_id_output`: This is the `user_id` for the group.
    *   `total_duration_output`: This is the sum of `calculated_duration_seconds` for all sessions belonging to that user within the filtered range. The `UserSessions.calculated_duration_seconds` refers to the `calculated_duration_seconds` field of the records within each partition group, which originated from the `UserSessions` collection.
3.  `final_result`: This sorts the `user_total_session_durations` by `total_duration_output` in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first. The result provides the user ID and their total session duration in seconds, as requested.",64.22560930252075,"# Step 1: Filter sessions by the specified date range and calculate the duration of each session in seconds.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`**: This line defines a variable `one_month_ago_date` which represents the date and time exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`).
2.  **`current_date_val = DATETIME('now')`**: This line defines a variable `current_date_val` representing the current date and time.
3.  **`sessions_last_month = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sessions.
    *   The condition `(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_date) & (session_start_ts <= current_date_val)` ensures that we only include sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is on or after one month ago and on or before the current moment.

This is interpreted as counting user sessions that started within a rolling one-month window ending at the current moment.

1.  **Define the Time Period**:
    *   The start of the period is exactly one month before the current time (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
    *   The end of the period is the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).

2.  **Filter User Sessions**:
    *   Access the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   Filter sessions where the `session_start_ts` falls within this defined period (inclusive of start and end).

3.  **Count Sessions**:
    *   Count the number of sessions that meet the filter criteria.

4.  **Return the Total Count**:
    *   The final result should be a single number representing this total count, calculated on the `Ewallet` graph.

1.  **Define the ""previous month"" period**: We'll calculate the start and end dates of the calendar month immediately preceding the current date.
    *   The start of the previous month is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`.
    *   The end of the previous month (exclusive) is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
2.  **Identify relevant transactions**: We'll filter the `Transactions` collection for entries that:
    *   Occurred within the defined ""previous month"" period (based on `created_at`).
    *   Are ""wallet transactions"". We'll assume this means `transaction_type == ""WALLET""`.
3.  **Count total and successful transactions**:
    *   Count all transactions matching the criteria from step 2 to get the `total number of transactions`.
    *   Among these, count those that were ""successful"". We'll assume this means `status == ""COMPLETED""` to get the `number of successful transactions`.
4.  **Calculate STR**: Using the definition provided (STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions), we'll compute the rate. This will be expressed as a percentage. If there are no relevant transactions, STR will be 0.

The query will be performed on the `Ewallet` collection to calculate these global aggregates.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block defines two helper variables:
    *   `_previous_month_start_date`: The exact start timestamp of the previous calendar month.
    *   `_current_month_start_date`: The exact start timestamp of the current calendar month (which serves as the exclusive end for the previous month).
2.  The second `CALCULATE` block uses these date boundaries to count:
    *   `_total_wallet_transactions_previous_month`: The total number of transactions within the previous month that have `transaction_type` equal to ""WALLET"".
    *   `_successful_wallet_transactions_previous_month`: The count of transactions from the above set that also have a `status` of ""COMPLETED"".
3.  The final `CALCULATE` block computes the `str_for_wallet_transactions_previous_month`:
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_total_wallet_transactions_previous_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
    *   If there are transactions, it calculates STR as `(_successful_wallet_transactions_previous_month * 100.0) / _total_wallet_transactions_previous_month` to get a percentage.
    *   If there are no wallet transactions in the previous month, STR is set to `0.0`.

2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll filter all transactions that occurred within the determined previous month.
    *   **Assumption for ""wallet transactions""**: The query assumes that all transactions in the `Transactions` collection are considered ""wallet transactions"". If ""wallet transactions"" refer to a specific `transaction_type` (e.g., `transaction_type == 'WALLET'`), this condition would need to be added to the transaction filters.
3.  **Count Successful Transactions**: We'll count the transactions from the previous month that were successful.
    *   **Assumption for ""successful transaction""**: A transaction is considered successful if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`.
4.  **Count Total Transactions**: We'll count all transactions from the previous month.
5.  **Calculate STR**: STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`. We'll also handle the case where the total number of transactions is zero to prevent division by zero, returning 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation of the code:**

1.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)` block determines the target year (`_prev_month_target_year`) and month (`_prev_month_target_month`) corresponding to the ""previous month"" relative to the current date.
2.  The second `.CALCULATE(...)` block uses these date parameters to:
    *   Count `_num_successful_transactions_prev_month`: It filters the `Transactions` collection for records where the `created_at` date falls within the target previous month and the `status` is ""completed"".
    *   Count `_num_total_transactions_prev_month`: It filters the `Transactions` collection for all records where the `created_at` date falls within the target previous month.
3.  The third and final `.CALCULATE(...)` block computes the `previous_month_str`. It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_num_total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than zero.
    *   If true, it calculates STR as `(_num_successful_transactions_prev_month * 100.0) / _num_total_transactions_prev_month` (as a percentage).
    *   If false (i.e., no transactions in the previous month), it returns `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_creation_date_parts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   It calculates `merchant_creation_year_field` (the year the merchant was created) and `merchant_creation_month_field` (the month the merchant was created) for each merchant.
    *   It also carries forward the merchant's `mid` and `name` under temporary names (`merchant_id_temp`, `merchant_name_temp`).

2.  `merchants_with_coupon_counts = merchants_with_creation_date_parts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step takes the records from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using a `WHERE` clause:
            *   `YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation year matches the merchant's creation year.
            *   `MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation month matches the merchant's creation month.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are passed through as `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val`.

3.  `top_merchant_details = merchants_with_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:
    *   This step takes the merchants along with their respective counts of coupons created in their creation month.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. If there's a tie, one of the top merchants will be chosen.

4.  `result = top_merchant_details.CALCULATE(...)`:

    *   `&`: This is the logical AND operator.
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `notification_type == 'promotional'`: Selects notifications that are promotional.
        *   `status == 'unread'`: Selects notifications that are unread.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Ensures that only users who have one or more such notifications are included.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this function is used to select and compute the desired output fields for each qualifying user.
    *   `user_name = username`: Selects the `username` of the user and renames it to `user_name`.
    *   `num_unread_promotional_notifications = COUNT(...)`: Calculates the total number of unread promotional notifications for each user.
        *   `COUNT(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')))`: This counts the notifications within the `notifications` sub-collection of each user that match the 'promotional' type and 'unread' status.

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_date` in ascending order, presenting the data from the earliest month in 2023 onwards.

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` table. It selects transactions that:
    *   Occurred in 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   Were initiated by a user (`sender_type == ""user""`).
    *   Were successful (`status == ""successful""`).
    *   Were sent by a user who is currently marked as active (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
2.  `transactions_with_month_and_user_id`: This `CALCULATE` step processes the `filtered_transactions`. For each transaction, it:
    *   Derives `transaction_month_asat_date` by taking the `created_at` timestamp and truncating it to the start of its month (e.g., ""2023-01-15 10:00:00"" becomes ""2023-01-01 00:00:00""). This provides a consistent date value for each month.
    *   Extracts `sender_user_uid` which is the `uid` of the `sending_user`. This ID will be used for counting distinct users.
3.  `monthly_distinct_active_users`: This is the core aggregation step.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_sends"", by=(transaction_month_asat_date))` groups the records from `transactions_with_month_and_user_id` based on the `transaction_month_asat_date`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each group (i.e., each month).
        *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_asat_date`: Selects the month (which is the partition key).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(transactions_with_month_and_user_id.sender_user_uid)`: Counts the number of unique `sender_user_uid` values within that month's group. This gives the number of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
4.  `result`: This line orders the `monthly_distinct_active_users` by `month_as_date` in ascending order, so the earliest month appears first.

5.  Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select the `receiver_id` (renamed as `merchant_id`) from each partition, effectively giving us the distinct list of merchant IDs.

```python

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Transactions.WHERE(receiver_type == ""merchant"")`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only records where the `receiver_type` is ""merchant"". This means the recipient of the transaction was a merchant.
*   `.PARTITION(name=""distinct_merchant_receivers"", by=receiver_id)`: This partitions the filtered transactions based on the `receiver_id`. Each partition will correspond to a unique `receiver_id` (merchant ID).
*   `.CALCULATE(merchant_id=receiver_id)`: For each partition (i.e., for each distinct `receiver_id`), this selects the `receiver_id` and renames it to `merchant_id`. The result is a collection containing a single column `merchant_id` with a distinct list of merchant IDs that have received money.",40.00849199295044,"distinct_receiving_merchant_ids = Transactions.WHERE(receiver_type == ""merchant"").PARTITION(name=""distinct_merchant_receivers"", by=receiver_id).CALCULATE(merchant_id=receiver_id)","cache_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=18408)] cached_content_token_count=18408 candidates_token_count=409 candidates_tokens_details=None prompt_token_count=20287 prompt_tokens_details=[ModalityTokenCount(modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>, token_count=20287)] thoughts_token_count=3031 tool_use_prompt_token_count=None tool_use_prompt_tokens_details=None total_token_count=23727 traffic_type=None",No Match,NaN,"Return the distinct list of merchant IDs that have received money from a transaction.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection, as each record in this collection represents a unique merchant with a unique merchant ID (`mid`).
2.  Filter these merchants to include only those who have at least one transaction in their `transactions_received` sub-collection. The `HAS()` function is used for this, checking if the count of received transactions is greater than or equal to 1. This sub-collection represents transactions where the merchant was the receiver.
3.  For the filtered merchants, select their merchant ID (`mid`). We will alias this as `merchant_id` in the output.

Since we are iterating through the `Merchants` collection (where each merchant is unique) and selecting their `mid`, the resulting list of `merchant_id`s will inherently be distinct.

```python
distinct_merchant_ids_received_transactions = Merchants.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1).CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)

**Explanation:**

*   `Merchants`: This accesses the collection of all merchants.
*   `.WHERE(HAS(transactions_received) == 1)`: This filters the merchants.
    *   `transactions_received`: This is a sub-collection on each merchant record, listing all transactions where that merchant was the receiver.
    *   `HAS(transactions_received) == 1`: This condition checks if the merchant has at least one transaction in their `transactions_received` list. This implies they have ""received money"" (or been designated to receive funds) in at least one transaction.
*   `.CALCULATE(merchant_id=mid)`: For each merchant that satisfies the `WHERE` condition, this selects their merchant ID.
    *   `mid`: This is the field in the `Merchants` collection that stores the merchant's unique ID.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_from_users_info = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(sender_type == 0)` filters these transactions to include only those where the `sender_type` is 0 (assumed to represent users).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then processes each filtered transaction to create new fields:
        *   `sender_country_field = sending_user.country`: Retrieves the country of the sending user.
        *   `sender_user_id_field = sending_user.uid`: Retrieves the unique ID of the sending user.
        *   `transaction_amount_field = amount`: Retrieves the amount of the transaction.

2.  `country_summary_data = transactions_from_users_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""country_group_transactions"", by=(sender_country_field))` groups the records from `transactions_from_users_info` based on the `sender_country_field`. Each group is named `country_group_transactions`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then computes aggregates for each country group:
        *   `country = sender_country_field`: Selects the country name.
        *   `num_of_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(country_group_transactions.sender_user_id_field)`: Counts the number of unique sending users within that country group using their IDs.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(country_group_transactions.transaction_amount_field)`: Sums up all transaction amounts within that country group.

3.  `top_5_countries_by_sent_amount = country_summary_data.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the `country_summary_data` (which has one record per country with its aggregates).

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection. We filter them based on three conditions:
    *   Their `status` must be ""active"".
    *   Their `category` must contain the string ""retail"". We use `LOWER()` on the category and search for ""retail"" to ensure case-insensitivity.
    *   They must have at least one balance record. We use `HAS(balances) == 1` for this.

2.  **Determine the Latest Balance for Each Filtered Merchant**: For each merchant that meets the above criteria, we need to find their most recent wallet balance.
    *   Each merchant has a `balances` sub-collection (which are `MerchantBalances` records). Each record in this sub-collection has a `balance` amount and an `updated_at` timestamp.
    *   To find the latest balance, we use the `RANKING` window function on the `balances` sub-collection for each merchant. We rank these balance records by `updated_at` in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each merchant.
    *   We select the balance record where the rank is 1 (i.e., the most recent). `allow_ties=False` is the default, ensuring a single top record even if timestamps are identical (though this is unlikely for timestamps).
    *   `SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of the `WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)` clause as a single record, from which we extract the `balance` value.
    *   This latest balance is stored in a new calculated field, let's call it `current_merchant_balance`. This step results in a new collection (`merchants_with_latest_balance`) where each record represents a filtered merchant and includes their `current_merchant_balance`.

3.  **Calculate the Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` aggregation function is used on the `current_merchant_balance` attribute of the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection.
    *   This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` (graph) level to produce a single output value representing the overall median.

```python
# Step 1: Filter merchants who are active, in 'retail' category, and have balance records.
active_retail_merchants_with_balances = Merchants.WHERE(
    (status == ""active"") &
    CONTAINS(LOWER(category), ""retail"") &
    (HAS(balances) == 1)
)

# Step 2: For each filtered merchant, calculate their most recent balance.
# 'balances' refers to the sub-collection of balances for each merchant.
# RANKING is performed per merchant to find their latest balance entry.
merchants_with_latest_balance = active_retail_merchants_with_balances.CALCULATE(
    current_merchant_balance = balances.WHERE(
        RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1
    ).SINGULAR().balance
)

# Step 3: Calculate the median of these latest balances across all such merchants.
# The result is a single value.
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    median_wallet_balance = MEDIAN(merchants_with_latest_balance.current_merchant_balance)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `active_retail_merchants_with_balances`: This line filters the `Merchants` collection. It keeps only those merchants who are `active`, whose `category` (converted to lowercase) `CONTAINS` ""retail"", and who have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (`HAS(balances) == 1`).
2.  `merchants_with_latest_balance`: This line takes the previously filtered merchants and, for each one, calculates a new field `current_merchant_balance`.

The ranking is done `per=""Merchants""`, meaning it's reset for each merchant. We then filter for the entry with rank 1.

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection. We apply two filters:

    *   The merchant's `category` (converted to lowercase) must contain the substring 'retail'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the category.
2.  **Access Balances**: For these filtered merchants, we access their associated balance records through the `balances` sub-collection. This gives us a collection of `MerchantBalances` records.
3.  **Filter Balances by Update Date**: We then filter these `MerchantBalances` records to include only those that were `updated_at` today. This is done by comparing the date part of `updated_at` (truncated to the start of the day) with the current date (also truncated to the start of the day).
4.  **Calculate Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the `MEDIAN` of the `balance` field from these filtered, today-updated balance records. This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single result representing the overall median.

2.  Filter out merchants who do not have any coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, use `CALCULATE` to:

This record is stored as `earliest_coupon_record`.
4.  Filter these merchants further using `WHERE`. The condition checks if the `start_date` of the `earliest_coupon_record` is:
    *   On or after the merchant's registration date (`earliest_coupon_record.start_date >= merchant_reg_date`).
    *   Within one year of the merchant's registration date. This is checked by ensuring the coupon's start date is less than or equal to the registration date plus one year (`earliest_coupon_record.start_date <= DATETIME(merchant_reg_date, '1 year')`).

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter out merchants who do not have any coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, use a `CALCULATE` operation to determine:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `temp_merchant_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `temp_registration_date`.
    *   The ID (`cid`) of their earliest coupon as `temp_earliest_coupon_cid`. This is found by taking the merchant's `coupons`, selecting the top 1 ordered by `start_date` in ascending order (`TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`), making it a singular record (`SINGULAR()`), and then accessing its `cid`.
    *   The start date (`start_date`) of their earliest coupon as `temp_earliest_coupon_start_date`, using a similar approach.
4.  Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these records further. The condition ensures that the `temp_earliest_coupon_start_date` is:
    *   Greater than or equal to the `temp_registration_date`.
    *   Less than or equal to one year after the `temp_registration_date`. The date one year later is calculated using `DATETIME(temp_registration_date, '1 year')`.
5.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` operation to select the required fields and assign them their final names: `merchant_id`, `registration_date`, `earliest_coupon_id`, and `earliest_coupon_start_date`.

Explanation:
-   The query starts with the `Users` collection.
-   It filters users using a `WHERE` clause. The condition `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1` checks if a user has no notifications that meet the inner `WHERE` condition.
-   The inner `notifications.WHERE(created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))` filters a user's notifications to include only those created strictly before one full year had passed since the user's own `created_at` date (signup date). `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')` calculates this one-year-later timestamp.
-   If a user has no notifications falling into this ""first year"" period, they are included in the result.
-   Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the `username` (aliased as `user_name`), `email` (aliased as `user_email`), and `created_at` (aliased as `signup_date`) for these users.",45.10864210128784,"users_no_early_notification = Users.WHERE(

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we need to determine the date that is exactly one year after their `created_at` date. This can be done using the `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')` function.
3.  We then filter the `notifications` sub-collection for each user to find any notifications that were created *before* this one-year mark (`notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`).
4.  The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check if the result of this filtered notification sub-collection is empty. If it's empty, it means the user did not receive any notifications within their first year.
5.  Users who satisfy this condition are selected.
6.  Finally, for these selected users, we retrieve their `username`, `email`, and their original `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`).

Explanation:
-   `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
-   `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1`: This is the main condition for filtering users.
    -   `notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`: For each user, this part filters their `notifications`. It selects notifications whose `created_at` timestamp is earlier than one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp.
        -   `notifications.created_at`: Refers to the creation date of a notification.
        -   `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`: Calculates the date one year after the user's signup date (`Users.created_at`).
    -   `HASNOT(...) == 1`: This checks if the filtered collection of notifications (those received within the first year) is empty. If it is empty, the user is included in the result.
-   `.CALCULATE(username=username, email=email, signup_date=created_at)`: For the users who meet the criteria, this selects their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date (which is their signup date, aliased here as `signup_date`).",46.24016857147217,"users_without_first_year_notification = Users.WHERE(
