**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the entries in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `total_transactions`: Counts all transactions for the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `successful_transactions`: Counts only the transactions where the `status` field is exactly 'Completed' using `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'Completed'))`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: This step takes the results from the previous calculation and computes:
    *   `success_rate`: Divides the `successful_transactions` by `total_transactions` and multiplies by `100.0` (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division) to get the percentage success rate. It also keeps the `customer_name`.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted based on the calculated `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).",18.93682241,"# Filter customers with at least 5 transactions and calculate counts

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the entries in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates two fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:**
    *   `start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the exact timestamp for the beginning of the current week based on the system's configuration (e.g., Sunday or Monday).
    *   `start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-8 weeks')`: Calculates the timestamp exactly 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week. This marks the beginning of our analysis window.

2.  **Filter Transactions:**
    *   `relevant_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Selects only the transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within our desired time frame: greater than or equal to the `start_of_period` and strictly less than the `start_of_current_week`. This effectively excludes the current week.

3.  **Calculate Week Info:**
    *   `transaction_info = relevant_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_flag = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the transaction's day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" and creates a boolean flag (`True` if it's a weekend, `False` otherwise).

4.  **Group by Week:**
    *   `weekly_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=week_start)`: Groups the `transaction_info` records based on the unique `week_start` dates. All transactions from the same week will be placed into the same partition group, accessible via the name `weekly_data`.

5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts:**
    *   `weekly_summary = weekly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`: Operates on each partition group (each week).
        *   `week_starting = week_start`: Selects the week start date (the partition key).
        *   `total_transactions = COUNT(weekly_data.Transactions)`: Counts all transactions belonging to the current week's partition group.
        *   `weekend_transactions = COUNT(weekly_data.Transactions.WHERE(is_weekend_flag == True))`: Counts only those transactions within the current week's group where the previously calculated `is_weekend_flag` is `True`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the week's starting date.

6.  **Assign Result:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the key date boundaries using the `Broker` top-level collection:
    *   `start_of_current_week`: Finds the date corresponding to the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday, depending on system settings) using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `start_of_period`: Calculates the date 8 weeks prior to the `start_of_current_week` using `DATETIME(..., '-8 weeks')`. This marks the beginning of our analysis window.

2.  **`transactions_in_period`**: We access the `Transactions` collection via `time_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates).
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: Filters transactions to include only those whose `date_time` falls on or after `start_of_period` and strictly before `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting the 8 full weeks preceding the current one.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction:
        *   `transaction_week_start`: Determines the start date of the week the transaction belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_flag`: Creates a numerical flag. It checks if the `DAYNAME` of the `date_time` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" using `ISIN`. If true, `IFF` returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

3.  **`weekly_transaction_summary`**: This performs the main aggregation.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_groups"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the `transactions_in_period` collection into distinct weeks based on the calculated `transaction_week_start` date.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week_starting_date`: Selects the `transaction_week_start` value (which is the same for all transactions in the group) to identify the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions`: Sums the `is_weekend_flag` for all transactions in the group using `SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_flag)`. Since the flag is 1 for weekend transactions and 0 otherwise, the sum gives the count of weekend transactions.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting_date.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries in chronological order based on their start date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the time window for ""last week"".
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` calculates the date of the first day of the previous week (e.g., if today is Wednesday, it finds the start of the current week and subtracts 7 days).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` calculates the date of the last day of the previous week (e.g., if today is Wednesday, it finds the start of the current week and subtracts 1 day, giving the previous Sunday if the week starts on Monday).
    *   These calculated dates (`start_last_week`, `end_last_week`) are stored in the `date_boundaries` context.
2.  **`usa_transactions_last_week = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Transactions` collection.

        *   `(date_time < start_of_current_week)`: Ensures the transaction date is before the start of the current week, effectively selecting only transactions from *last* week.
        *   The `&` operator combines these conditions.
    *   **`total_transaction_amount = SUM(...)`**: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for the same set of filtered transactions.
        *   It applies the identical `WHERE` clause to filter transactions from US customers last week.
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Aggregates the amounts.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to compute three new fields for each customer:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with the customer using `SUM(transactions_made.amount)`.
2.  **`result = customer_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the intermediate `customer_stats` collection and performs another `CALCULATE`:
    *   It keeps the previously calculated `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.
    *   It calculates `CR` (Customer Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. `RANKING(by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` ranks the customers based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1). Since no `per` argument is specified, the ranking is performed across all customers in the `customer_stats` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is exactly 'buy' and the `date_time` falls within the last 10 days (including the current day). `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, 'now') <= 9` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between the transaction date and now; a value of 0 means today, 1 means yesterday, up to 9 for 9 full days ago, covering a 10-day window.
2.  **`transaction_info`**: This takes the filtered transactions and calculates a new field `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` field from the related `ticker` record. This makes the symbol available for partitioning.
3.  **`ticker_counts`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection based on the `ticker_symbol`. For each unique symbol (each partition group), it calculates the `ticker_symbol` itself and the total count of transactions (`num_buy_transactions`) within that group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
4.  **`top_2_frequent_tickers`**: This applies the `TOP_K` function to the `ticker_counts` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply two filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `transaction_type == 'buy'`: Selects only buy transactions.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: Filters transactions that occurred within the last 10 days (inclusive of today). `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days.
2.  **Calculate Ticker Symbol:** We use `CALCULATE` to add the `ticker_symbol` (obtained from the related `ticker` record) to each filtered transaction record. This is needed so `ticker_symbol` can be used as a simple field name in the `PARTITION` step.
3.  **Partition by Ticker:** We use `PARTITION` to group the filtered transactions based on their `ticker_symbol`. Each group (`ticker_group`) contains all the recent buy transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **Count Transactions per Ticker:** We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `ticker_symbol` group:
    *   We select the `ticker_symbol` (which is the partition key).
    *   We use `COUNT(Transactions)` to count the number of original transaction records within that specific ticker symbol's group, naming this count `num_buy_transactions`.
5.  **Select Top 2:** Finally, we use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 groups (ticker symbols) with the highest `num_buy_transactions`, ordered from highest to lowest count.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final result containing the top 2 ticker symbols and their corresponding buy transaction counts is assigned to the `result` variable.",22.12946438789368,"# Step 1: Filter transactions to include only 'buy' types within the last 10 days.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: Calculates the necessary date boundaries: the first day of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the first day of the month six months prior (`six_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  **`customers_in_period`**: Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls between `six_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and `current_month_start` (exclusive). It also extracts the `signup_year` and `signup_month_num` from the `join_date`.
3.  **`customers_with_month_str`**: Creates a formatted string `signup_month_str` in 'YYYY-MM' format for easier grouping and display. `LPAD` ensures the month number is two digits (e.g., '06' instead of '6').
4.  **`monthly_customer_stats`**:
    *   Partitions the filtered customers using `PARTITION` based on the `signup_month_str`. This groups customers by the month they signed up.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Selects the `signup_month` (which is the partition key `signup_month_str`).
        *   Calculates `pmcs` (Per Month Customer Signups) by counting the `Customers` within each monthly partition group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
        *   Calculates `pmat` (Per Month Average Transaction Amount) by calculating the average `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within that specific signup month group using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`.
    *   Orders the final result chronologically using `ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first define `start_date` (6 months before the start of the current month) and `end_date` (the start of the current month) using the `DATETIME` function to establish the time window.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Customers**: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the calculated `start_date` and `end_date`. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `signup_year` and `signup_month` from their `join_date`.
3.  **Partition by Signup Month**: The `customer_info` collection is partitioned using `PARTITION` based on the `signup_year` and `signup_month`. This groups customers who signed up in the same month.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: Within each monthly group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   `signup_period`: We create a formatted string ""YYYY-MM"" representing the signup month using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting (e.g., ""2023-05"").
    *   `pmcs`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` within each partition group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   `pmat`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction Amount (PMAT) by taking the average (`AVG`) of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within that specific signup month group.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, `ORDER_BY(signup_period.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically based on the signup month.",24.70271921157837,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months, excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_prices_info = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection. It then filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `date` is within the last 6 days relative to the current time (`'now'`), effectively capturing the last 7 days inclusive of today.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_type = ticker.ticker_type, close_price = close)`**: After filtering, this calculates two fields for each relevant price record:
    *   `ticker_type`: It retrieves the `ticker_type` by navigating from the `DailyPrices` record to its associated `ticker` record. This is needed for grouping later.
    *   `close_price`: It explicitly selects the `close` price, making it available for the subsequent aggregation step.
3.  **`partitioned_prices = recent_prices_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered and calculated data (`recent_prices_info`) and partitions it.
    *   `name=""type_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (optional but good practice).
    *   `by=(ticker_type)`: Specifies that the data should be grouped based on the unique values of the `ticker_type` field calculated previously.
4.  **`ticker_type_acp = partitioned_prices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step operates on each partition group created.
    *   `ticker_type = ticker_type`: Selects the `ticker_type` (which is the key for the current partition group).
    *   `ACP = AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: Calculates the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each group. `AVG(DailyPrices.close)` computes the average of the `close` field from the original `DailyPrices` records that belong to the current `ticker_type` partition group. The result is assigned to the `ACP` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022_info`**: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is in the year 2022. It then calculates two fields for each of these customers: their `country` and a boolean `has_transactions` which is true if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
2.  **`country_groups`**: This partitions the `customers_2022_info` collection based on the `country` field. Each partition (`countries`) represents a unique country containing customers who joined in 2022.
3.  **`country_metrics`**: This calculates metrics for each country partition.
    *   `country_name`: Retrieves the country name from the partition key.
    *   `total_customers_in_group`: Counts the total number of customers within that country's partition (all joined in 2022).
    *   `active_customers_in_group`: Sums the `has_transactions` boolean field for customers within the partition. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this effectively counts the customers who have transactions.
4.  **`country_activity_ratio` / `result`**: This calculates the final Activity Ratio (AR) for each country.
    *   `country`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR`: Calculates the ratio using the formula `(active_customers_in_group / total_customers_in_group) * 100.0`. The `IFF` function is used to prevent division by zero errors by returning `0.0` if `total_customers_in_group` is zero for a specific country. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage calculation. The final result containing the country and its AR is assigned to the `result` variable.",25.72567677,"# Filter customers who joined in 2022 and determine if they have transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022_with_transactions`**:
    *   Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Filters customers using `WHERE` to include only those who joined in 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`) AND have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to select the `country` and create a new boolean/numeric field `is_active`. This field is `True` (evaluates as 1 in aggregations) if the customer's `status` is 'Active', and `False` (evaluates as 0) otherwise.

2.  **`country_activity_ratio`**:
    *   Takes the filtered `customers_2022_with_transactions`.
    *   Uses `PARTITION` to group these customers by their `country`. The group name is `country_group`.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Selects the `country` for each group.
        *   Calculates the `AR` (Activity Ratio):
            *   `SUM(customers_2022_with_transactions.is_active)`: Sums the `is_active` flag for all customers within the current country partition. This effectively counts the number of active customers with transactions in that country.
            *   `COUNT(customers_2022_with_transactions)`: Counts the total number of customers within the current country partition (all of whom have transactions due to the initial filter).
            *   The ratio of these two counts is multiplied by `100.0` (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division) to get the percentage as defined by the AR formula.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This selects records from the `Transactions` collection, filtering for those where the `transaction_type` is ""sell"" and the `date_time` is within the last month (from exactly one month ago up to the current time, using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
2.  **`transactions_with_symbol`**: This takes the filtered transactions and calculates the `ticker_symbol` by accessing the related `ticker` collection. It also includes `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` so these values are available for aggregation after partitioning.
3.  **`ticker_groups`**: This partitions the `transactions_with_symbol` data into groups based on the unique `ticker_symbol`. Each group contains all the relevant sell transactions for a specific ticker.
4.  **`ticker_aggregates`**: For each `ticker_group`, this calculates the sum of `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` using the `SUM` aggregation function applied to the `Transactions` within that group's context. It retains the `ticker_symbol` as the grouping key.
5.  **`result`**: This final step takes the aggregated results and calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) using the provided formula: `(Total Amount - (Total Tax + Total Commission)) / Total Amount * 100`. An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, preventing division by zero errors and assigning an SPM of 0.0 in such cases.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info`**: We start with `DailyPrices` and use `CALCULATE` to extract the `month` in 'YYYY-MM' format and retrieve the `symbol` from the related `ticker`. We also keep the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices needed for aggregation.
2.  **`ticker_monthly_aggregates`**: We partition `price_info` by `symbol` and `month`. Within each group (each ticker's specific month), we calculate the `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low` using aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) applied to the `DailyPrices` within that partition group.
3.  **`symbol_groups`**: We re-partition the results (`ticker_monthly_aggregates`) by `symbol`. This creates groups where each group contains all the monthly aggregate rows for a single ticker.
4.  **`result`**: We access the monthly data within each symbol group (`symbol_groups.monthly_groups`). Here, we calculate:
    *   `prev_avg_close`: We use the `PREV` window function to get the `avg_close` from the previous row *within the same symbol group*. `by=month.ASC()` ensures we look at the chronologically previous month, and `per=""symbol_groups""` ensures this calculation is done independently for each ticker symbol based on the ancestor partition name. `default=None` handles the first month for each ticker where there's no previous month.
    *   `momc`: We calculate the month-over-month change using the formula `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`. We use `IFF` to check that `prev_avg_close` is not `None` and not zero before performing the division, returning `None` otherwise.
5.  **Final `CALCULATE` and `ORDER_BY`**: We select only the required output columns (`symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, `momc`) and order the results by symbol and then by month for readability.",32.46964431,"# Step 1: Calculate monthly aggregates (avg close, max high, min low) for each ticker symbol

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a `month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting and sorting) and retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker`. It also selects the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices needed for later calculations.
2.  **`monthly_stats = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data first by `symbol` and then by `month`. Within each unique symbol-month group, it calculates:
    *   `avg_close`: The average of the `DailyPrices.close` values for that group.
    *   `max_high`: The maximum of the `DailyPrices.high` values for that group.
    *   `min_low`: The minimum of the `DailyPrices.low` values for that group.
    The result `monthly_stats` is a collection where each row represents a specific ticker for a specific month, along with its calculated statistics.
3.  **`result = monthly_stats.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the `monthly_stats` and calculates the final required fields:
    *   It keeps `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`.
    *   **`prev_avg_close=PREV(...)`**: This is the core of the MoM calculation. The `PREV` window function looks at the previous row's `avg_close` value.
        *   `by=month.ASC()`: It orders the rows chronologically by `month` before looking back.
        *   `per=""symbol""`: Crucially, it does this calculation *independently for each symbol*. It only looks at the previous month *for the same ticker*.
        *   `default=None`: If there is no previous row (i.e., it's the first month of data for that ticker), it returns `None`.
    *   **`MoMC=IFF(...)`**: This calculates the Month-over-Month Change. It uses `IFF` to handle edge cases:
        *   It checks if `prev_avg_close` is not `None` (meaning a previous month exists) AND if `prev_avg_close` is not `0` (to prevent division by zero).
        *   If both conditions are true, it calculates `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
        *   Otherwise (first month or previous average was zero), it assigns `None` to `MoMC`.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted alphabetically by ticker symbol and then chronologically by month for easier reading.",39.18846154212952,"# Step 1: Prepare DailyPrices data by extracting month in 'YYYY-MM' format

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection and filter it to include only those tickers that have at least one entry (`HAS(...) == 1`) in their `historical_prices` sub-collection within the specified date range (`date >= ""2023-04-01""` and `date <= ""2023-04-04""`). This avoids calculations for tickers with no relevant data.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each qualifying ticker:
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the ticker's symbol.
    *   `max_high_in_range=MAX(...)`: Calculates the maximum `high` price from the `historical_prices` that fall within the specified date range.
    *   `min_low_in_range=MIN(...)`: Calculates the minimum `low` price from the `historical_prices` that fall within the specified date range.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used because the `price_change` calculation depends on the results of the aggregations (`max_high_in_range`, `min_low_in_range`) performed in the previous step.
    *   `price_change=max_high_in_range - min_low_in_range`: Calculates the difference between the highest high and lowest low found in the range for that ticker.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: Selects the top 3 tickers based on the calculated `price_change`, ordered in descending order (highest change first).
5.  **`.CALCULATE(symbol=ticker_symbol, price_change=price_change)`**: Selects only the final required fields (`symbol` and `price_change`) for the output, renaming `ticker_symbol` back to `symbol` as requested.

    *   `price_change=...`: Calculates the difference between the maximum high price and the minimum low price found within the specified date range for that ticker's historical prices.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection and calculate intermediate fields:

    *   `join_month=MONTH(join_date)`: Extracts the month the customer joined.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used to compute the number of transactions. This is necessary because the `COUNT` aggregation needs access to `join_year` and `join_month` which were defined in the previous step.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts the transactions for each customer.
    *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: Filters the customer's transactions (`transactions_made`) to include only those where:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_join_month`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. In the first `CALCULATE`, we extract the `YEAR` and `MONTH` from the `join_date` for each customer and store them as `join_yr` and `join_mth`, respectively. We also select the customer's `_id` and `name`, renaming them to `cust_id` and `cust_name` for clarity.
2.  **`customer_transaction_counts`**: We take the result from the previous step. In the second `CALCULATE`, we access the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer. We use `WHERE` to filter these transactions, keeping only those where the `YEAR(date_time)` matches the customer's `join_yr` AND the `MONTH(date_time)` matches the customer's `join_mth`. We then use `COUNT()` on this filtered sub-collection to get the number of transactions made in the same month the customer joined, storing this count as `num_transactions_in_join_month`. We pass along `cust_id` and `cust_name`.
3.  **`top_customer`**: We apply `TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())` to the `customer_transaction_counts` collection. This sorts the customers in descending order based on their `num_transactions_in_join_month` and selects only the top one (the customer with the highest count).
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the `top_customer` result to select and rename the fields as requested: `_id` (from `cust_id`), `name` (from `cust_name`), and `num_transactions` (from `num_transactions_in_join_month`).",22.640258312225345,"# Calculate the join year and month for each customer

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step accesses the `Transactions` collection and calculates two new fields for each transaction: `cust_state` (derived from the related customer's state) and `tick_type` (derived from the related ticker's type). This makes these fields directly available on the transaction level for partitioning.
2.  **`partitioned_transactions = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection into groups. Each group (`state_type_groups`) represents a unique combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
3.  **`combination_counts = partitioned_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each unique combination (group), it calculates:
    *   `customer_state`: The state from the partition key `cust_state`.
    *   `ticker_type`: The ticker type from the partition key `tick_type`.
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of `Transactions` belonging to that specific combination group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the state of the associated customer (`customer.state`) and the type of the associated ticker (`ticker.ticker_type`), assigning them to new fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`state_ticker_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition the `transaction_info` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups the transactions based on the unique combinations of the values in the `cust_state` and `tick_type` fields. Each group is named ""combinations"".
3.  **`combination_counts = state_ticker_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we use `CALCULATE` again. We select the partitioning keys (`cust_state` and `tick_type`, renaming them to `customer_state` and `ticker_type` for the final output) and calculate the total number of transactions within that specific group using `COUNT(Transactions)`. This gives us the count for each unique state-ticker type combination.
4.  **`top_5_combinations = combination_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: Finally, we use `TOP_K(5, by=num_transactions.DESC())` to select the 5 combinations with the highest `num_transactions`, sorting them in descending order based on the transaction count.
5.  **`result = top_5_combinations`**: The final result containing the top 5 combinations (customer state, ticker type, and number of transactions) is assigned to the `result` variable.",19.47833228111267,"# Calculate customer state and ticker type for each transaction

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**: This line starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to include only those customers for whom the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty (i.e., they have made at least one transaction).

    *   `transaction_count=COUNT(...)`: We calculate the number of relevant transactions for the customer.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We access the customer's transactions and filter them.

        *   `(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day') == ""2023-04-01"")`: We compare the date part of the `date_time` field (by truncating it to the start of the day) with the target date ""2023-04-01"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: We count how many transactions passed the filter.
2.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())`**: From the results of the previous step (which contains all customers and their respective transaction counts), we select the single record (`1`) that has the highest `transaction_count` (ordered descending `DESC`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: On the single top customer record obtained, we select the final fields.
    *   `_id=cust_id`, `name=cust_name`: We select the customer's ID and name, renaming them back to the original field names as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We calculate `start_period_date` (the first day of the week 9 weeks ago) and `end_period_date` (the first day of the current week). This defines the time window covering the last 8 full calendar weeks.
2.  **Filter High-Value Sales:** We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only sales where `sale_price` is greater than 30,000.
3.  **Access Payments:** We navigate from the filtered `Sales` to their associated `payment` records (which are `PaymentsReceived`).
4.  **Filter Payments by Date:** We filter these payments using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `payment_date` falls within our calculated time window (`>= start_period_date` and `< end_period_date`).
5.  **Calculate Week Information:** For the filtered payments, we use `CALCULATE` to determine the start date of the calendar week (`payment_week_start`) using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')` and a boolean flag (`is_weekend_payment`) indicating if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday using `ISIN` and `DAYNAME`.
6.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` to group the payments based on their `payment_week_start`. Each partition (`weekly_group`) contains all the payments made within that specific week.
7.  **Aggregate Counts:** Within each week's partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   We select the `payment_week_start` and rename it to `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received` is calculated by counting all payments within the partition using `COUNT(payments_with_week_info)`.
    *   `weekend_payments_received` is calculated by summing the `is_weekend_payment` boolean flag (where True=1, False=0) for payments within the partition using `SUM(payments_with_week_info.is_weekend_payment)`.
8.  **Order Results:** Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the weekly summaries chronologically by the week's start date.
9.  **Assign to Result:** The final ordered summary is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.54316044,"# Define the start and end dates for the last 8 full calendar weeks

final_result = weekly_summary.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We first establish the time frame using `DATETIME`. `start_of_current_week` gets the date of the Monday (or configured start day) of the current week. `start_of_period` calculates the date 8 weeks prior to `start_of_current_week`.
2.  **Filter Relevant Payments:**
    *   We start with the `Sales` collection and filter for sales where `sale_price > 30000`.
    *   We access the associated payments using `.payment`.
    *   We then filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` is on or after `start_of_period` and strictly before `start_of_current_week`, effectively selecting payments from the last 8 full calendar weeks.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping:**
    *   We use `CALCULATE` on the filtered payments (`relevant_payments`) to determine the start date of the week each payment belongs to using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')` and store it as `payment_week_start`.
    *   We also create a boolean flag `is_weekend` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` to easily identify weekend payments later.
4.  **Group by Week:**
    *   We use `PARTITION` on `payments_info` to group the records by the calculated `payment_week_start`. Each group in `weekly_groups` represents a unique week within our 8-week timeframe.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates:**
    *   We apply `CALCULATE` to the `weekly_groups`.
    *   `week=payment_week_start`: We select the partition key, renaming it to `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: For each week's group, we count all the associated `PaymentsReceived` records to get the total count for that week.
    *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.is_weekend)`: For each week's group, we sum the `is_weekend` flag (where True is treated as 1 and False as 0). This efficiently counts the payments that occurred on a weekend within that group.
6.  **Order Results:**
    *   Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the weekly summaries by the week start date in ascending order.
7.  **Assign to Variable:** The final result is assigned to the `final_result` variable.",32.55540370941162,"# Define the start of the current week and the start of the 8-week period before it

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and calculate uppercase versions of `make`, `model`, and `vin_number` to ensure case-insensitive matching and grouping later.
2.  **`.WHERE(CONTAINS(upper_vin, 'M5'))`**: We filter the cars to include only those where the uppercase `vin_number` contains the substring 'M5'. `CONTAINS` provides partial matching.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(upper_make, upper_model))`**: We partition the filtered cars into groups based on their uppercase `make` and `model`. This groups cars of the same make and model together, ignoring case differences (e.g., ""Toyota"" and ""toyota"" are grouped together).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   `car_make=upper_make`: Selects the uppercase make (the grouping key).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%'))`**: This line starts with the `Cars` collection and filters it.
    *   `UPPER(vin_number)` converts the `vin_number` field to uppercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%M5%')` checks if the uppercase VIN contains the substring 'M5'.
    *   The result is a collection of cars whose VIN contains 'M5'.
2.  **`model_sales_groups = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`**: This partitions the filtered cars (`cars_with_m5_vin`) into groups based on unique combinations of `make` and `model`. Each group is named `model_group`.
3.  **`sales_per_model = model_sales_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition group created in the previous step.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` field from the partition key.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` field from the partition key.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for each `(make, model)` group by counting the associated `sale_records` within that group. The `Cars` collection here refers to the subset of cars within the current partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: It selects sales where the associated car's make is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 29`: It further filters these sales to include only those where the difference between the `sale_date` and the current date (`'now'`) is 29 days or less. This effectively selects sales from the last 30 days, including today.
    *   `&`: Both conditions must be true for a sale to be included.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations on the top-level `Dealership` context, using the filtered sales data.
    *   `num_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales)`: It counts the number of records in the `recent_toyota_sales` filtered collection, giving the total number of Toyota sales in the specified period.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales.sale_price)`: It sums the `sale_price` for all sales included in the `recent_toyota_sales` collection, calculating the total revenue generated from these sales.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`toyota_sales_last_30_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection. It then applies a `WHERE` clause to filter these sales based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This checks if the `make` field of the associated `car` record (accessed via the `Sales.car` relationship) is exactly ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). The condition `<= 29` ensures that only sales made today (0 days difference) or within the previous 29 days (up to 29 days difference) are included, effectively covering the last 30 days inclusive.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations at the top level of the database (`Dealership`). It uses the previously filtered `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection:
    *   `num_sales = COUNT(toyota_sales_last_30_days)`: This counts the total number of records in the filtered `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection, giving the number of Toyota sales in the specified period.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(toyota_sales_last_30_days.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` field for all records in the filtered `toyota_sales_last_30_days` collection, calculating the total revenue from those sales.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_with_latest_status = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we calculate the `sale_price`, the `make` and `model` of the associated car (`car.make`, `car.model`), and determine the car's latest inventory status.
2.  **`latest_is_in_inventory=DEFAULT_TO(...)`**: This part finds the latest inventory snapshot for the car associated with the sale (`car.inventory_snapshots`).
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1` ranks the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) by date descending and selects the top-ranked one (the latest).
    *   `.SINGULAR().is_in_inventory` accesses the `is_in_inventory` field of that single latest snapshot.
    *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., True)` ensures that if a car has no snapshots (making the status unknown), it defaults to `True` (in inventory), effectively excluding it later.
3.  **`sales_of_cars_not_in_inventory = sales_with_latest_status.WHERE(latest_is_in_inventory == False)`**: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only the sales records where the associated car's latest inventory status is `False` (meaning it's confirmed not in inventory).
4.  **`grouped_by_make_model = sales_of_cars_not_in_inventory.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered sales records using the car's `make` and `model` as keys. This groups all sales for the same make/model combination together.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(make=car_make, model=car_model, highest_sale_price=MAX(Sales.sale_price))`**: Within each partition (group), we calculate the final output fields: `make`, `model`, and `highest_sale_price`. `MAX(Sales.sale_price)` finds the maximum `sale_price` among all the sales records belonging to that specific make/model group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
    *   `HAS(sale_records) == 1`: This condition ensures that we only consider cars that have been sold at least once.
    *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1).SINGULAR().is_in_inventory == False`: This is a more complex condition to check the latest inventory status.
        *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)`: We look into the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1`: We rank the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order. `== 1` selects the most recent snapshot.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking filter ensures only one snapshot (the latest) is selected per car, `SINGULAR()` allows us to treat it as a single record.
        *   `.is_in_inventory == False`: We check if the `is_in_inventory` field of this latest snapshot is `False`, meaning the car is not currently in inventory according to the latest record.
    *   The `&` combines these two conditions, so `filtered_cars` contains only cars that have been sold *and* are confirmed not in inventory based on their latest snapshot.
2.  **`make_model_groups = filtered_cars.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `filtered_cars` collection.
    *   `name=""make_model_group""`: Assigns a name to the partition context.
    *   `by=(make, model)`: Groups the cars based on their unique combination of `make` and `model`.
3.  **`max_prices_per_group = make_model_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we calculate the required information.
    *   `make=make, model=model`: We include the make and model, which are the partitioning keys.
    *   `highest_sale_price=MAX(Cars.sale_records.sale_price)`: We calculate the maximum `sale_price` found within the `sale_records` of all `Cars` belonging to the current `make_model_group`.
4.  **`result = max_prices_per_group.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the results based on the calculated `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first).",36.731961250305176,"# Step 1: Filter cars that have been sold and whose latest inventory snapshot indicates they are not in inventory.

2.  **`(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%ford%')`: Checks if the lowercase `make` contains ""ford"" anywhere within it (partial match).
    *   `LIKE(..., '%mustang%')`: Checks if the lowercase `model` contains ""mustang"" anywhere within it (partial match).
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines the two conditions, selecting cars that match either the make or the model criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and filter it using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`**: This condition filters for cars where the lowercase version of the `make` field contains 'ford' OR the lowercase version of the `model` field contains 'mustang'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching, and `LOWER` ensures case-insensitivity. The `|` operator represents the logical OR.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select and compute the desired output fields.
4.  **`car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year, car_color=color, car_vin=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields from the filtered cars and assign them to new names (`car_make`, `car_model`, etc.) for clarity.
5.  **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which contains all sales associated with the car) and applies the `AVG` aggregation function to the `sale_price` field within those records.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:** We first determine the start of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the date 6 months prior to that (`period_start`) using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data:** We access the `Sales` collection and filter records where the `sale_date` falls within our target period (`period_start` inclusive, `current_month_start` exclusive). In the same step, we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Create a `sale_month` field in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure correct sorting).
    *   Keep the `sale_price` for later aggregation.
    *   Extract the `salesperson_hire_year` using `YEAR(salesperson.hire_date)` for filtering within the partition.
3.  **Partition by Month:** We partition the prepared `sales_data` using `PARTITION(name=""months"", by=sale_month)`. This groups all sales from the target period by the month they occurred in.
4.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics:** We apply a `CALCULATE` operation on the `monthly_groups`:
    *   We select the `month` (which is the `sale_month` partition key).
    *   We define `relevant_sales_in_month` by filtering the `Sales` within each month's partition (`Sales` here refers to the records belonging to that specific month group) using a `WHERE` clause to keep only sales where the `salesperson_hire_year` (calculated earlier) is between 2022 and 2023.
    *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales count) is calculated by `COUNT(relevant_sales_in_month)`.
    *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated by `SUM(relevant_sales_in_month.sale_price)`. If no relevant sales occurred in a month that had *other* sales, these metrics will correctly be 0.
5.  **Order Results:** Finally, `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final calculated and ordered data is assigned to the `result` variable.",39.44074702,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the 6-month period prior

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info`**: Calculates the start date of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the start date of the month 6 months prior (`six_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function. This defines the time window for filtering sales.
2.  **`relevant_salespersons`**: Filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
3.  **`sales_in_period`**:
    *   Accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection from the `relevant_salespersons`.
    *   Filters these sales using `WHERE` to include only those with a `sale_date` within the calculated 6-month window (greater than or equal to `six_months_ago_start` and less than `current_month_start`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to create a `sale_month_str` field by formatting the `sale_date` into a ""YYYY-MM"" string (using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting). It also passes the `sale_price` through for later aggregation.
4.  **`monthly_sales_groups`**: Partitions the `sales_in_period` data based on the `sale_month_str`, grouping all sales from the same month together.
5.  **`monthly_metrics`**:
    *   Operates on the results of the partition.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to output the `sale_month` (renamed from `sale_month_str`).
    *   Calculates `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) by counting the number of `Sales` records within each month's partition group using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   Calculates `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) by summing the `sale_price` of the `Sales` records within each month's partition group using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
    *   Uses `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` to sort the final results chronologically by month.
6.  **`result = monthly_metrics`**: Assigns the final calculated and ordered monthly metrics to the `result` variable.

*Note*: This query calculates metrics for months within the specified range *that have sales data* matching the criteria. If a month within the last 6 months had zero sales from the selected salespersons, it will not appear in the output, as the `PARTITION` step only creates groups for existing `sale_month_str` values. Fulfilling the ""including those where metrics are 0"" requirement perfectly would typically require generating a complete series of months and joining, which is beyond the scope of a straightforward PyDough interpretation based on the provided rules.",28.792843103408813,"# Define the date range: last 6 months excluding the current month

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we want to compute a single aggregate value (the overall average) across the relevant data.
2.  `AVG(PaymentsReceived.DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   `PaymentsReceived`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection, as each record represents a payment received.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)`: For each payment record, this calculates the difference in ""days"" between the `sale_date` (accessed through the `sale_record` link back to the `Sales` collection) and the `payment_date` of the payment itself.
    *   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of all the day differences computed for each payment record.
3.  `ROUND(..., 2)`: The result of the `AVG` function is then rounded to 2 decimal places as requested.
4.  `avg_days_to_payment=...`: The final rounded average value is assigned to the field `avg_days_to_payment`.",16.56573343,"import Dealership

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only those sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
2.  **`revenue_and_cost = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates two aggregate values based on the filtered `sales_in_2023`:
    *   `total_revenue_2023`: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales that occurred in 2023.
    *   `total_cost_2023`: Sums the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale in 2023. It accesses the cost through the `Sales.car` relationship.
3.  **`gpm_calculation = revenue_and_cost.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) using the previously computed `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`.
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `total_cost_2023` is zero.
    *   If `total_cost_2023` is zero, it assigns `0.0` to `gpm_2023` to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   Otherwise, it applies the GPM formula: `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_on_exit_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each `Sale`, it checks if the associated `car` has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) record in its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that meets the nested `WHERE` criteria.
3.  **`(is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date)`**: This nested `WHERE` clause filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the specific car. It looks for snapshots where the car was marked as *not* in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) and where the `snapshot_date` of that inventory record is exactly the same as the `sale_date` of the current `Sale` being evaluated.
4.  **`top_priced_sale = sales_on_exit_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`**: After filtering to get only sales that occurred on the inventory exit day, we use `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` to select the single sale (`1`) with the highest `sale_price` in descending order (`DESC()`).
5.  **`result = top_priced_sale.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the resulting top sale record to extract the required fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step extracts the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` for each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `payment_info` data first by `pay_year` and then by `pay_month`. This groups all payments that occurred within the same calendar month.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: Within each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `pay_year`, `pay_month`: These are kept from the partition keys, primarily needed for correct sorting in the next step.
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation ""YYYY-MM"" is created for easier display of the month. `LPAD` ensures the month is always two digits (e.g., ""2023-01"").
    *   `total_monthly_payments`: The `SUM` aggregation function calculates the total `payment_amount` for all payments within that specific month's group.
4.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the collection of monthly totals.
    *   `year_month`, `total_payments`: These fields are selected for the final output.
    *   `mom_change`: This calculates the month-over-month change.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC()), default=0.0)`: This window function retrieves the `total_monthly_payments` value from the *previous* record.
        *   `by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())`: This crucial part tells `PREV` how to determine the ""previous"" record – it orders the monthly totals chronologically by year and then by month.
        *   `default=0.0`: For the very first month in the dataset, there is no preceding month. This sets the ""previous"" value to 0.0 for that initial calculation, so the `mom_change` for the first month will be equal to its `total_payments`.
        *   The final calculation subtracts the previous month's total (obtained via `PREV`) from the current month's total.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment record, it creates a string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., ""2023-05"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure the month part is always two digits). It also keeps the `payment_amount`.
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `payment_info` data based on the calculated `payment_month_str`. For each unique month string, it creates a group.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(month_str=..., total_payments=SUM(...))`**: Within each monthly partition, this calculates the total sum of `payment_amount` for all payments received in that specific month. It accesses the original `PaymentsReceived` collection context within the `SUM` aggregation as per standard `PARTITION` usage.
4.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the aggregated monthly totals.
    *   It selects the `month` (renamed from `month_str`) and the `total_monthly_payments`.
    *   It calculates the `mom_change` using the `PREV` window function. `PREV(total_payments, by=month_str.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_payments` from the *previous* record when ordered by `month_str` ascending. The `default=0.0` ensures that for the earliest month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the previous value is treated as 0, preventing errors or null results in the MoM calculation for that first month. The MoM change is then calculated as the current month's total minus this previous month's total.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted chronologically by month.

*Note*: This query calculates the total payments and MoM change *only for months where payments were received*. It does not generate rows for months with zero payments if no payments occurred in those months within the dataset, as generating a complete date series is typically beyond the standard capabilities assumed for this type of query language based on the provided reference.",35.82025933265686,"# Step 1: Calculate month string (YYYY-MM) for each payment

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`TSC=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `TSC` (Total Sales Count) and assign the result of the `COUNT` aggregation to it.

4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`**: This is the core filtering condition:
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date.
    *   `<= 6` ensures we include sales from today (difference = 0 days) up to 6 days ago (difference = 6 days), covering a total of 7 days inclusive of today.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those who have made at least one sale using `HAS(sales_made) == 1`. This ensures we only consider active salespersons and avoids potential division by zero errors when calculating ASP.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:

    *   `total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the total sum of `sale_price` for all sales made (`sales_made`) by the salesperson.
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the total number of sales made by the salesperson.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the results from the previous step:
    *   `first_name=s_first_name`: Passes through the first name.
    *   `last_name=s_last_name`: Passes through the last name.

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: We filter this collection based on a condition.
3.  **`HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == 'cash')) == 1`**: This is the core filtering logic:

    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == 'cash')`: Filters these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is 'cash'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the result of the filtered payments (for any sale made by the salesperson) is not empty. In other words, it checks if the salesperson has at least one sale for which a cash payment was received.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`salesperson_ids_from_cash_payments = cash_payments.sale_record.salesperson.CALCULATE(sp_id = _id)`**: Starting from the filtered `cash_payments`, we navigate through the relationships:
    *   `.sale_record`: Accesses the single `Sales` record associated with each cash payment.
    *   `.salesperson`: Accesses the single `Salespersons` record associated with that sale.
    *   `.CALCULATE(sp_id = _id)`: Selects the `_id` (the salesperson's unique identifier) from the `Salespersons` record and assigns it to a new temporary field `sp_id`. This results in a collection where each row represents a cash payment linked to a specific salesperson ID. Note that a salesperson might appear multiple times if they handled multiple cash sales.

2.  **`sp_first_name=first_name, sp_last_name=last_name`**: We select the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them for clarity.
3.  **`sales_count_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 30))`**: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection. We then filter these sales using `WHERE` to include only those where the difference between the `sale_date` and the current date (`'now'`) is less than or equal to 30 days. Finally, `COUNT` counts how many sales records remain after filtering.
4.  **`total_revenue_last_30_days=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 30).sale_price)`**: Similar to the count, we filter the `sales_made` for the last 30 days. Then, we use `SUM` on the `sale_price` of these filtered sales to get the total revenue generated by that salesperson in the specified period.
5.  **`.TOP_K(5, by=sales_count_last_30_days.DESC())`**: After calculating the count and revenue for all salespersons, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 records based on the `sales_count_last_30_days` field, sorting in descending order (`DESC()`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_sales_condition`**: This defines a reusable condition to filter sales that occurred within the last 30 days from today using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`.
2.  **`salesperson_performance`**:
    *   Starts with the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute metrics for each salesperson.
    *   `s_first_name`, `s_last_name`: Selects the first and last names.
    *   `recent_sales_count`: Counts the sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`) but only includes those matching the `recent_sales_condition`.
    *   `recent_revenue_total`: Sums the `sale_price` of the sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`), again only including those matching the `recent_sales_condition`. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no recent sales (resulting in a null sum), we output 0.0 instead.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""state_groups"", by=(state))`**: This groups the `Customers` collection by their `state`. Each group within the `state_groups` partition represents a unique state.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each state group created by the partition.
    *   `state_name=state`: Selects the state name (which is the partition key).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Sales` collection. For each sale record, it calculates three new fields:
    *   `customer_state`: Retrieves the state from the associated customer record (`Sales.customer.state`).
    *   `sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price` from the sale record.
    *   `customer_key`: Retrieves the unique identifier (`_id`) from the associated customer record (`Sales.customer._id`). This is needed later to count unique customers.
2.  **`state_aggregates = sales_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This step takes the `sales_info` data and partitions (groups) it based on the `customer_state`.
    *   `name=""state_sales""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(customer_state)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `customer_state` calculated in the previous step.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this `CALCULATE` operates on each state group:
    *   `state=customer_state`: Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_unique_customers=NDISTINCT(Sales.customer_key)`: Calculates the number of distinct `customer_key` values within the sales records belonging to the current state partition. This gives the count of unique customers for that state.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records within the current state partition. This gives the total revenue for that state.
4.  **`top_5_states_by_revenue = state_aggregates.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This step takes the aggregated results for each state and selects the top 5 based on the `total_revenue`, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC()`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_date_3_months_ago = DATETIME('now', '-3 months')`**: This line defines the start date for our analysis period. It calculates the date exactly 3 months prior to the current date and time using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it. The `HAS(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago)) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider salespersons who have made at least one sale (`sales_made`) on or after the calculated `start_date_3_months_ago`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required information:
    *   `rep_first_name=first_name`, `rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   `total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`: Counts the number of sales records associated with the salesperson (`sales_made`) that fall within the specified date range.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` for all sales made by the salesperson within the specified date range.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 records from the calculated statistics, ordered by the `total_revenue` field in descending order (highest revenue first).
5.  **`result = top_3_sales_reps`**: The final result, containing the first name, last name, total sales count, and total revenue for the top 3 sales representatives in the last 3 months, is assigned to the `result` variable.",25.60486578941345,"# Define the start date for the 3-month period (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(termination_date != None)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is not null (meaning the salesperson has been terminated).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Creates new fields for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `salesperson_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Concatenates the `first_name` and `last_name` fields with a space in between to create a full name.

    *   `employment_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date` in days, representing the total duration of employment.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_days.ASC())`**: Selects the single record (`1`) with the minimum value for the calculated `employment_days` field, effectively finding the salesperson with the shortest employment duration among those terminated.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_weekend_utility_payments` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` aggregation function.
3.  **`PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `COUNT`, we specify the collection to count from (`PaymentsMade`) and apply filters using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters for payments made specifically to the vendor named 'Utility Company'.
5.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`**: This condition checks if the payment date falls on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` checks if the extracted day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
6.  **`&`**: The ampersand combines the two conditions, ensuring that we only count payments that meet *both* criteria (vendor is 'Utility Company' AND the payment was made on a weekend).

    *   `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This checks if the day of the week for the `payment_date` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". `DAYNAME()` extracts the day name from the date, and `ISIN()` checks if that name is present in the provided tuple `(""Saturday"", ""Sunday"")`.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result at the top `Dealership` level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates of the *previous* ISO week relative to the current time (`'now'`).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` finds the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` subtracts 7 days to find the start of the previous week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` subtracts 1 day from the start of the current week to find the end date (inclusive) of the previous week (e.g., Sunday).
2.  **`payments_in_prev_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_of_prev_week` and `end_of_prev_week` available) and filter the records where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated range of the previous week.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered payments, we prepare the data for partitioning:
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: We extract just the date part from `payment_date` to group payments by day, ignoring the time component.
    *   We keep `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for the next steps.
4.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_in_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the prepared payment data.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_day, payment_method)`: Groups the data first by the day of payment and then by the payment method within each day.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group:
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the day (renamed from `payment_day` for clearer output).
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method for the group.
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific day/method group. We refer back to the original collection (`PaymentsReceived`) within the `SUM` function as required after partitioning.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(payment_date.ASC(), payment_method.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first by date in ascending order, and then by payment method within each date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the top-level `Dealership` collection.
    *   `start_curr_iso_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the start date (Monday) of the current week based on the current timestamp (`'now'`). We assume the system's week start is configured to Monday for ISO week compatibility.
    *   `start_prev_iso_week=DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Calculates the start date (Monday) of the *previous* week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
2.  **`payments_last_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_prev_iso_week` and `start_curr_iso_week` available) and filter the payments. The `WHERE` clause selects payments whose `payment_date` is on or after the start of the previous week (`>= start_prev_iso_week`) and *before* the start of the current week (`< start_curr_iso_week`), effectively capturing all moments within the previous full ISO week.
3.  **`payments_info = payments_last_week.CALCULATE(...)`**: We prepare the filtered data for partitioning.
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field `payment_day` by truncating the original `payment_date` to midnight. This ensures all payments on the same calendar day are grouped together, regardless of the time.
    *   `pay_method=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` field, renaming it slightly for clarity within the partition step.
4.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `payments_info` collection.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_day, pay_method)`: Groups the records based on the unique combinations of the truncated payment day and the payment method.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group.
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the day (which is a partition key).
    *   `payment_method=pay_method`: Selects the payment method (the other partition key).
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific `payment_day` and `pay_method` group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_2023_info = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection and filters it to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023 using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `qtr_start_date=IFF(...)`: Determines the starting date of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions (similar to IF-ELSEIF-ELSE):
        *   If the month is 1-3 (Q1), it takes the start of the year (`DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of y')`).
        *   If the month is 4-6 (Q2), it takes the start of the year plus 3 months.
        *   If the month is 7-9 (Q3), it takes the start of the year plus 6 months.
        *   Otherwise (month 10-12, Q4), it takes the start of the year plus 9 months.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""state_quarters"", by=(cust_state, qtr_start_date))`**: This groups the `sales_2023_info` records based on unique combinations of the calculated `cust_state` and `qtr_start_date`. Each group represents a specific state and quarter.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final calculation operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the state for the group.
    *   `quarter_start=qtr_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all the original `Sales` records that belong to the current state/quarter group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_info_2023 = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, it calculates:
    *   `cust_state`: The state of the customer associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
    *   `quarter_number`: The quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4) derived from the `sale_date` using integer division `(MONTH(sale_date) + 2) // 3`.
    *   `sale_price`: Retains the `sale_price` for later aggregation.

4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   It selects the `state` and `q_num` (the partition keys).
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: It calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter group. Note that `SUM` operates on the original `Sales` collection's context within the partition group.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after aggregation**: Takes the aggregated results and formats the output:
    *   `customer_state=state`: Renames `state` to `customer_state`.
    *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: Converts the numeric quarter (`q_num`) into the corresponding quarter start date string (e.g., 1 becomes '2023-01-01').

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_march_inventory_snapshot`**: This contextless expression defines the criteria for the specific inventory snapshots we are interested in.
    *   `inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `InventorySnapshots` collection.
    *   `((YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) & (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3))`: This filters snapshots taken in March 2023.

It ranks the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection because we want a result for each drug. `CALCULATE` is used to select the `drug_name` and compute the new `average_ddd` field.
2.  **`average_ddd=AVG(...)`**: We calculate the average DDD using the `AVG` aggregation function. This function operates on the values calculated for the associated treatments of each drug.
3.  **`treatments_used_in`**: Inside `AVG`, we access the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which links each drug to its treatments.
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: We filter these treatments based on the DDD definition criteria:
    *   `end_dt != None`: Ensures the treatment has a defined end date.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Calculates the treatment duration in days and ensures it's positive to avoid division by zero or invalid durations.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, we perform an inner `CALCULATE` to determine its individual DDD value (`ddd_val`).
    *   `ddd_val=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This implements the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
6.  **`.ddd_val`**: We access the `ddd_val` calculated in the inner step. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `ddd_val` values for all valid treatments associated with the current drug.
7.  **`result = avg_ddd_per_drug`**: The final result, containing `drug_name` and `average_ddd` for each drug, is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.40655851,"# Calculate average DDD for each drug

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Valid Treatments:** We start by accessing the `Treatments` collection. We apply a `WHERE` clause to filter only those treatments that have a non-null `end_dt` (`HAS(end_dt) == 1`) and where the duration between `start_dt` and `end_dt` is greater than 0 days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`). This prevents division by zero and adheres to the DDD definition requirement.
2.  **Calculate DDD per Treatment (Implicit within AVG):** Inside the main `CALCULATE` on `Drugs`, the `AVG` function operates on the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug. Within the `AVG`, we re-apply the same filters (`WHERE(...)`) to ensure we only consider valid treatments for that specific drug. Then, we use an inner `CALCULATE` to compute the `ddd_val` (which is `tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`) for each of these valid treatments.
3.  **Group by Drug and Average:** The `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)` structure effectively groups the results by drug. The `AVG(...)` function then calculates the average of the `ddd_val` computed in the previous step across all valid treatments associated *with that specific drug*.
4.  **Filter Drugs:** An outer `WHERE` clause is applied to the `Drugs` collection (`Drugs.WHERE(HAS(...) == 1)`) to ensure that we only include drugs that have at least one treatment meeting the validity criteria (non-null `end_dt` and duration > 0). This avoids calculating averages for drugs with no relevant treatment data.
5.  **Select Output Fields:** The final `CALCULATE` selects the `drug_name` and the calculated `average_ddd` for each qualifying drug.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final query result is assigned to the variable `result`.",32.72743105888367,"# Calculate DDD for each valid treatment first

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate two key dates using `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`:
    *   `start_of_current_month`: The first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_of_period`: The first day of the month three months prior to the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')`.
2.  **`relevant_treatments`**: We access the `Treatments` collection starting from `date_boundaries`.
    *   We filter these treatments using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `start_dt` falls within the desired period (from `start_of_period` up to, but not including, `start_of_current_month`).
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each relevant treatment:
        *   `treatment_month`: Formats the `start_dt` into a 'YYYY-MM' string for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., '2023-05').
        *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag indicating if the treatment's associated drug (`Treatments.drug`) has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
        *   `patient_key`: Extracts the `patient_id` from the related patient (`Treatments.patient`) which is needed for distinct counting later.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: We partition the `relevant_treatments` collection using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""months""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(treatment_month)`: Groups the treatments based on the calculated `treatment_month`.
4.  **`result`**: We perform the final calculation on the partitioned data.
    *   `month = treatment_month`: Selects the month identifier.
    *   `total_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_key` values within each month's partition group (`Treatments` here refers to the treatments within that specific month's group).
    *   `biologic_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(Treatments.patient_key, Treatments.is_biologic_treatment))`: Counts the number of unique `patient_key` values *only* for those treatments where `is_biologic_treatment` is true within each month's group. `KEEP_IF` returns the `patient_key` if the condition is true, otherwise null; `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique non-null keys.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the start date of the current month (`start_current_month`) and the start date of the period 3 months prior (`start_period`) using the `DATETIME` function relative to 'now'. This defines the time window for our analysis (the last three full calendar months).
2.  **`treatment_info`**: We access the `Treatments` collection through `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates). We filter treatments whose `start_dt` falls within our calculated period (`>= start_period` and `< start_current_month`). For these treatments, we calculate:
    *   `treatment_month`: The year and month of the treatment start date, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"".
    *   `patient_key`: The `patient_id` associated with the treatment.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag indicating if the treatment used a drug with `drug_type` equal to 'biologic'.
3.  **`monthly_patient_counts`**: We partition the `treatment_info` data by the calculated `treatment_month`. This groups all treatments that started in the same month.
4.  **`CALCULATE` after `PARTITION`**: For each monthly group (`monthly_groups`):
    *   We select the `month` (which is the partition key `treatment_month`).
    *   `patient_count`: We calculate the number of distinct `patient_key` values within that month's group using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)`. This gives the total unique patients treated in that month.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: We calculate the number of distinct `patient_key` values *only for treatments where `is_biologic_treatment` is True* within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment == True).patient_key)`. This gives the unique patients receiving biologic treatments in that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Patients.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Patients` collection.
2.  `HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This checks if each patient has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) treatment record within their `treatments_received` list that satisfies the inner `WHERE` condition.
3.  `(diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')`: This inner condition filters the treatments, ensuring that the treatment's associated diagnosis name is exactly 'Psoriasis vulgaris' AND the treatment's associated drug type is 'biologic'.
4.  `filtered_patients = ...`: This assigns the resulting collection of patients (those who meet the criteria) to the `filtered_patients` variable.
5.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(distinct_patient_count=COUNT(filtered_patients))`: Finally, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a calculation. `COUNT(filtered_patients)` counts the number of records in the `filtered_patients` collection, which represents the distinct count of patients meeting the specified criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start the calculation at the top level of the database (`DermTreatment`) to get a single result (the count).
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_patients` and assign it the count of the filtered `Patients` collection.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it based on a condition.
4.  **`HAS(...) == 1`**: This checks if each patient has at least one record in their `treatments_received` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` condition.
5.  **`treatments_received.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the treatments received by the patient.
6.  **`(diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')`**: This is the core filtering condition applied to each treatment. It checks if the treatment's associated diagnosis name is 'Psoriasis vulgaris' AND the treatment's associated drug type is 'biologic'.

2.  **`end_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`**: This calculates the date corresponding to the beginning of the current month.
3.  **`alice_treatments_in_period = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
    *   `patient.first_name == ""Alice""`: Selects treatments associated with a patient whose first name is ""Alice"".
    *   `start_dt >= start_period`: Ensures the treatment started on or after the beginning of the 6-month window.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`start_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`**: This defines the beginning of the time window. It takes the current date/time (`'now'`), truncates it to the beginning of the current month (`'start of month'`), and then subtracts 6 months (`'-6 months'`). This gives the date exactly 6 months before the first day of the current month.
2.  **`end_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`**: This defines the end of the time window (exclusive). It takes the current date/time and truncates it to the beginning of the current month. Treatments must start *before* this date.
3.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
4.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function will count the number of treatments that meet the criteria inside.

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as we want to retrieve information about adverse events.
2.  **`.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == 'topical')`**: We filter these events. For each adverse event, we navigate through its singular relationship `treatment` to the corresponding `Treatments` record, then through the treatment's singular relationship `drug` to the corresponding `Drugs` record. We check if the `drug_type` field of this drug is equal to 'topical'. Only adverse events linked to treatments using topical drugs are kept.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: We select and rename the desired fields for the filtered adverse events:
    *   `event_description=description`: Selects the `description` field from the `AdverseEvents` record.
    *   `treatment_identifier=treatment.treatment_id`: Selects the `treatment_id` from the related `Treatments` record via the `treatment` relationship.
    *   `drug_identifier=treatment.drug.drug_id`: Selects the `drug_id` from the related `Drugs` record by navigating through `treatment` and then `drug`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctor_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Doctors` collection and calculates initial information for each doctor:
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `speciality=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: Calculates the count of unique drug IDs associated with the treatments prescribed by each doctor. `prescribed_treatments` links to `Treatments`, `drug` links that treatment to a `Drugs` record, and `drug_id` is the field we count distinctly.

2.  **`specialty_groups = doctor_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the results from the previous step based on the `speciality` field. Doctors are now grouped together based on their specialty. The partition is named `spec_group`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the boundaries for our time window using the `DermTreatment` high-level collection.
    *   `current_month_start`: Finds the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_range`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 12 months prior to the `current_month_start` using `DATETIME(..., '-12 months')`.
2.  **`monthly_treatments_filtered`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection, accessed via `date_boundaries` to inherit the calculated dates.
    *   `CALCULATE(treatment_month=DATETIME(start_dt, 'start of month'))`: For each treatment, we extract the starting month by truncating the `start_dt` to the beginning of its month.
    *   `WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments to include only those whose `treatment_month` falls within our desired range: greater than or equal to `start_range` and strictly less than `current_month_start`. This effectively selects treatments from the last 12 full months, excluding the current incomplete month.
3.  **`monthly_stats`**: We partition the filtered treatments.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""months"", by=treatment_month)`: Groups the treatments based on the `treatment_month` calculated previously.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each monthly group (`months`):
        *   `month=treatment_month`: Selects the month identifier.
        *   `PMPD=NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Calculates the Per Month Patient Diagnoses (PMPD) by counting the number of unique `patient_id`s within that month's treatments. Since each treatment links a patient and a diagnosis, this counts distinct patients diagnosed/treated in that month.
        *   `PMTC=COUNT(Treatments)`: Calculates the Per Month Treatment Count (PMTC) by counting the total number of treatments within that month's group.
    *   `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: Calculates the start date of the current month and the start date of the month 12 months prior using `DATETIME` functions. This defines the time window for analysis.
2.  **`filtered_treatments`**:
    *   Starts with the `Treatments` collection accessed via `date_boundaries` (to inherit the calculated dates).
    *   Filters treatments using `WHERE` to include only those with a `start_dt` within the calculated 12-month window (greater than or equal to 12 months ago start, and less than the current month start).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to extract the `treatment_year` and `treatment_month` from `start_dt`.
    *   Crucially, it calculates `patient_id_if_diag` using `KEEP_IF`. This field will hold the `patient.patient_id` *only if* the treatment has an associated diagnosis (`HAS(diagnosis) == 1`); otherwise, it will be null.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: Partitions the `filtered_treatments` collection into groups based on the combination of `treatment_year` and `treatment_month`. Each group represents a specific month within our time frame.
4.  **`monthly_stats`**:
    *   Operates on the `monthly_groups` partition.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute the metrics for each month group:
        *   `pmpd` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id_if_diag)`. `NDISTINCT` counts unique non-null values, so this correctly counts the distinct patients who had a treatment *with a diagnosis* starting in that month.
        *   `pmtc` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated using `COUNT(Treatments)`, which simply counts all treatments within that month's partition group.
    *   Includes `year` and `month` from the partition keys.
5.  **`result`**:
    *   Selects the final desired columns (`year`, `month`, `pmpd`, `pmtc`).
    *   Orders the results chronologically using `ORDER_BY(year.ASC(), month.ASC())`.",36.41985321044922,"# Define the date boundaries: start of the current month and start of 12 months prior

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_year`**: This part identifies the year each patient had their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)` finds the earliest `start_dt` among all treatments for each patient.
    *   `YEAR(min_start_dt)` extracts the year from this earliest date.
    *   `.WHERE(HAS(first_treatment_year)==1)` ensures we only consider patients who actually have treatments (and thus a `min_start_dt`).

2.  **`yearly_new_patients`**: This part counts the number of new patients for each year.
    *   It takes the `patient_first_treatment_year` data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year)` groups the patients based on the year they had their first treatment.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then computes:
        *   `year`: The year of the first treatment (the partition key).
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of patients within that year's partition (`COUNT(Patients)`).

3.  **`result`**: This final step calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI).
    *   It takes the `yearly_new_patients` counts.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` computes:
        *   `year`: The year.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of new patients for that year.
        *   `NPI`: The difference between the current year's `num_new_patients` and the previous year's count.
            *   `PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=num_new_patients)` retrieves the `num_new_patients` value from the preceding record when ordered by `year`.
            *   `default=num_new_patients` handles the very first year in the dataset; since there's no previous year, `PREV` returns the current `num_new_patients`, resulting in an NPI of 0 for the first year.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` sorts the final output chronologically by year.",30.83418989,"# Step 1: Find the year of the first treatment for each patient

**Explanation:**

1.  **`new_patient_info`**: This step filters the `Patients` collection to include only those who have received at least one treatment (`WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`). For each of these patients, it calculates the year of their earliest treatment start date using `YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt))` and assigns it to `first_treatment_year`.
2.  **`yearly_new_patients_count`**: This step takes the `new_patient_info` and partitions it by the `first_treatment_year`. For each year group, it calculates the `year` (which is the partition key) and the count of patients within that group (`num_new_patients=COUNT(Patients)`). The result is then ordered by year in ascending order, which is essential for the next step using the `PREV` function.
3.  **`npi_calculation`**: This step takes the yearly counts and calculates the New Patient Increase (`npi`). It does this by subtracting the number of new patients from the *previous* year (`PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's count (`num_new_patients`). The `PREV` function looks back one record based on the specified ordering (`by=year.ASC()`), and `default=0` handles the first year where there is no previous year.
4.  **`result = npi_calculation`**: The final calculated data including the year, number of new patients for that year, and the NPI compared to the previous year is assigned to the `result` variable.",23.082088232040405,"# Step 1: For each patient with treatments, find the year of their first treatment start date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ae_info = AdverseEvents.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection. For each event, we calculate:
    *   `is_same_month`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the adverse event's `reported_dt` match the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the associated `treatment.start_dt`.
    *   `drug_id` and `drug_name`: We retrieve the ID and name of the drug involved in the treatment by navigating through `treatment.drug`.
2.  **`drug_event_counts = ae_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `ae_info` data by `drug_id` and `drug_name`. This groups all adverse event records associated with the same drug.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each drug partition (`drug_group`), we calculate:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_2022 = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Treatments` collection. It then filters these treatments based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`: It keeps only treatments where the year of the `end_dt` (end date) is 2022.
    *   `HAS(outcome_records.day100_pasi_score) == 1`: It ensures that the treatment has at least one associated outcome record where the `day100_pasi_score` is present (not null).
    *   `.CALCULATE(ins_type = patient.ins_type)`: For the filtered treatments, it calculates a new temporary field `ins_type` by accessing the `ins_type` from the related `patient`. This is necessary because `ins_type` will be used as the partitioning key.

2.  **`partitioned_by_insurance = treatments_2022.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered `treatments_2022` data and partitions it.
    *   `name=""insurance_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not strictly used later in this query).
    *   `by=(ins_type)`: Groups the treatments based on the unique values of the `ins_type` field calculated in the previous step.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operation is performed on each partition group (i.e., for each unique insurance type).
    *   `insurance_type = ins_type`: Selects the insurance type (which is the partition key).
    *   `avg_pasi_100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of the `day100_pasi_score` from the `outcome_records` associated with the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
    *   `distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id`s associated with the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_filtered`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and filter it to include only those records where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)`. We then use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `ins_type` (insurance type) from the related `patient` record, creating a temporary field `insurance_type` needed for partitioning.
2.  **`insurance_type_groups`**: We partition the `treatments_filtered` data using `PARTITION`. The `name=""ins_type_group""` assigns a name to the partition context, and `by=(insurance_type)` specifies that the grouping should be done based on the `insurance_type` calculated in the previous step.
3.  **`insurance_type_stats`**: We apply `CALCULATE` to the partitioned data. For each `insurance_type` group:
    *   `ins_type = insurance_type`: We select the insurance type (the partition key).
    *   `avg_day100_pasi = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: We calculate the average of the `day100_pasi_score` found in the `outcome_records` associated with the `Treatments` belonging to the current insurance type group. `AVG` handles the aggregation over the potentially multiple treatments and outcomes within the group.
    *   `distinct_patient_count = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: We count the number of unique patients (`patient_id`) associated with the `Treatments` in the current insurance type group using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  **`top_5_insurance_types`**: We use `TOP_K(5, by=avg_day100_pasi.ASC())` to select the top 5 records from `insurance_type_stats`, ordering them by the calculated `avg_day100_pasi` in ascending order (lowest score first).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cutoff_date_calc`**: This calculates the cutoff date, which is 6 calendar months before the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` achieves this. This value is calculated at the top level (`DermTreatment`) so it can be accessed later.
2.  **`specialty_groups`**: This partitions the `Doctors` collection based on their `speciality`. Each partition (`specialties`) represents a unique specialty.
3.  **`specialty_stats`**: This calculation is performed on each specialty partition:
    *   `doc_specialty=speciality`: Selects the specialty name (the partition key).
    *   `total_drug_prescribed=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments (`Doctors.prescribed_treatments`) associated with doctors in that specialty partition, but only including treatments where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `cutoff_date`.
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with doctors in that specialty partition, again filtering for treatments where `start_dt` is on or after the `cutoff_date`.
    *   `.WHERE(num_treatments > 0)`: Filters out any specialties that had zero treatments meeting the date criteria.
4.  **`top_specialties`**: This selects the top 3 records from `specialty_stats` based on the `total_drug_prescribed` in descending order.
5.  **`result = top_specialties`**: Assigns the final result to the `result` variable.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cutoff_date_calc`**: We first calculate the date marking the beginning of our 6-month window. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months', 'start of month')` gets the current date, subtracts 6 months, and then finds the first day of that resulting month. This ensures we capture full calendar months.
2.  **`recent_treatments_info`**: We filter the `Treatments` collection to include only those where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `six_months_ago_start`. We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the `speciality` from the linked `doctor` record, naming it `doc_specialty` to prepare for partitioning.
3.  **`specialty_groups`**: We use `PARTITION` to group the `recent_treatments_info` collection by the `doc_specialty`. Each group in `specialties` represents a unique doctor specialty.
4.  **`specialty_stats`**: For each specialty group created by the partition, we `CALCULATE` the required aggregates:
    *   `specialty=doc_specialty`: We retrieve the specialty name (which was the partition key).
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(Treatments)`: We count the number of `Treatments` records within each specialty group (using the original `Treatments` context available within the partition).
    *   `total_drug_amount=SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: We sum the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within each specialty group.
5.  **`top_3_specialties_by_drug_amount`**: We apply `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` to the `specialty_stats` to select the top 3 records based on the calculated `total_drug_amount` in descending order.
6.  **`result = ...`**: The final result containing the top 3 specialties, their treatment counts, and total drug amounts is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.33077478408813,"# Calculate the start date for the 6-month window (start of the month, 6 months ago)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Treatments` collection based on multiple conditions combined using the logical AND operator (`&`).
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition filters treatments linked to a diagnosis whose name (`diag_name`) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. `LOWER()` makes the comparison case-insensitive, and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards allows matching anywhere within the string.
3.  **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This checks if the drug associated with the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). `HAS(...) == 1` ensures the field exists and is not null.
4.  **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the treatment record has an end date specified.
5.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This compound condition filters treatments that ended within the last 6 months.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `end_dt > ...` ensures the treatment ended *after* 6 months ago.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `end_dt <= ...` ensures the treatment ended on or before the current moment (i.e., not in the future).
6.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a final calculation.
7.  **`count_of_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`**: This counts the number of records remaining in the `filtered_treatments` collection after all the `WHERE` conditions have been applied and assigns the count to the `count_of_treatments` field.",19.39300919,"# Filter treatments based on diagnosis name, drug FDA approval, and end date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start from the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need to perform a global count aggregation.
2.  **`num_matching_treatments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a result field `num_matching_treatments` and assign it the count of the filtered `Treatments`.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and apply a filter based on the specified conditions.
4.  **`(CONTAINS(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), 'psoriasis'))`**: This checks the first condition. It accesses the linked `diagnosis`, gets its `diag_name`, converts it to lowercase using `LOWER` for case-insensitivity, and then uses `CONTAINS` to check if 'psoriasis' is a substring.
5.  **`(drug.fda_appr_dt != None)`**: This checks the second condition. It accesses the linked `drug` and verifies that its `fda_appr_dt` field is not null, indicating it has an FDA approval date.
6.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This checks the third condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time exactly 6 months before the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   The condition ensures the treatment's `end_dt` falls strictly after 6 months ago and is less than or equal to the current moment.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`context_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: First, we calculate the `target_reg_year`. This is done by finding the maximum `year_reg` across all doctors using `MAX(Doctors.year_reg)` and subtracting 2. This value is calculated once at the top level (`DermTreatment`).
2.  **`doctors_filtered = context_info.Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Doctors` collection via `context_info` (which allows access to `target_reg_year`). We filter this collection to keep only doctors where:
    *   Their `year_reg` matches the calculated `target_reg_year`.
    *   They have prescribed at least one treatment, checked using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`.
3.  **`result = doctors_filtered.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform the main calculation on the filtered doctors.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`, `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: We select the doctor's last name and registration year, renaming them temporarily.
    *   `first_treatment_info=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`: For each doctor, we find their first treatment.
        *   We access the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection for the current doctor.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1`: We rank these treatments based on their `start_dt` in ascending order (`ASC`). The `per=""Doctors""` ensures the ranking is done independently for each doctor. We filter to keep only the treatment(s) ranked 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `WHERE` returns a collection (even if it contains only one item), and the outer `CALCULATE` expects a singular value here, `SINGULAR()` is used to extract the single record representing the first treatment. This assumes each doctor has a unique earliest treatment start date or picks one if there's a tie.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The final `CALCULATE` selects the desired output fields and renames them according to the request: `last_name`, `year_reg`, `first_treatment_id` (extracted from `first_treatment_info`), and `first_treatment_start_dt` (extracted from `first_treatment_info`).",26.992378,"# Calculate the target registration year (2 years before the latest registration year found in the data)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2`**: This calculates the registration year we are interested in by getting the current year using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))` and subtracting 2.
2.  **`doctors_registered_2_years_ago = Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Doctors` collection to include only those whose `year_reg` matches the `target_year` and who have at least one prescribed treatment (`HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`).
3.  **`result = doctors_registered_2_years_ago.CALCULATE(...)`**: This initiates the first calculation step on the filtered doctors.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's registration year.
    *   `first_treatment_record=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`: This finds the first treatment for each doctor.
        *   `prescribed_treatments`: Accesses the list of treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1)`: Ranks the treatments within the context of each doctor (`per=""Doctors""`) based on the `start_dt` in ascending order. It then filters to keep only the treatment ranked first (the earliest one).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the ranking filter yields exactly one treatment record per doctor, allowing us to treat it as a singular record.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This second `CALCULATE` is used to access the fields *within* the `first_treatment_record` that was created in the previous step.
    *   `doc_last_name=doc_last_name`: Passes through the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=doc_year_reg`: Passes through the doctor's registration year.
    *   `first_treatment_date=first_treatment_record.start_dt`: Extracts the `start_dt` from the singular first treatment record.
    *   `first_treatment_id=first_treatment_record.treatment_id`: Extracts the `treatment_id` from the singular first treatment record.

2.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)`**: This function calculates the number of full days between the `start_dt` of the associated treatment (accessed via `treatment.start_dt`) and the `reported_dt` of the adverse event.
3.  **`(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: This condition filters the adverse events. It selects events where the `reported_dt` is on or after the `treatment.start_dt` (difference is 0 or more days) AND no more than 10 days after the `treatment.start_dt` (difference is 10 days or less).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and potentially renames the final fields for the output.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  The query starts with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE` to find records that meet two conditions:
    *   The treatment is a placebo (`is_placebo == True`).
    *   The treatment has at least one associated concomitant medication (`concomitant_meds`) whose start date (`start_dt`) is within 14 days *after* the treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`). This is checked using `HAS()` combined with `WHERE` and `DATEDIFF`. The `DATEDIFF` condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures the med started on or after the treatment, but no more than 14 days later.
3.  For the treatments that satisfy these conditions (`qualifying_treatments`), the query accesses their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This retrieves *all* concomitant medications associated with each qualifying treatment, not just the ones that met the date criteria in the filter step.
4.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used on this sub-collection to select the desired fields for each concomitant medication record, referencing its parent treatment's details:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the qualifying placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the qualifying placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the qualifying placebo treatment.
    *   `med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication.
    *   `med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.
5.  The `result` variable holds a collection where each row corresponds to a concomitant medication linked to a placebo treatment that had at least one med starting within the specified 2-week window.",33.34074783,"# Filter treatments to find those that are placebo and have at least one concomitant med starting

**Explanation:**

1.  **`placebo_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`**: This line starts with the `Treatments` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `is_placebo` field is `True`.
2.  **`qualifying_meds = placebo_treatments.concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each of the previously filtered `placebo_treatments`. It then applies another `WHERE` clause to filter these concomitant medications.
3.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`**: This calculates the difference in days between the start date of the parent treatment (`treatment.start_dt`) and the start date of the concomitant medication (`start_dt`). It ensures the medication started on or after the treatment began.
4.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`**: This ensures the difference calculated above is less than or equal to 14 days (2 weeks).
5.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines the two `DATEDIFF` conditions, so only concomitant medications starting 0 to 14 days (inclusive) after the treatment start date are kept.
6.  **`result = qualifying_meds.CALCULATE(...)`**: This takes the filtered `qualifying_meds` and selects the final output fields.
7.  **`treatment_id = treatment.treatment_id, treatment_start_dt = treatment.start_dt, treatment_end_dt = treatment.end_dt`**: These lines access the parent `treatment` record associated with each qualifying concomitant medication and retrieve its `treatment_id`, `start_dt`, and `end_dt`.
8.  **`concomitant_med_start_dt = start_dt, concomitant_med_end_dt = end_dt`**: These lines retrieve the `start_dt` and `end_dt` from the qualifying `ConcomitantMeds` record itself. Field names are slightly adjusted for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the average age).
2.  **`avg_male_private_age=AVG(...)`**: We define a new field `avg_male_private_age` and assign it the result of the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we access the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: The filter condition selects patients whose `gender` is 'Male' AND whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, 'now'))`**: For the filtered patients, we calculate a new temporary field `age_in_years`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference in full years between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (`'now'`).
6.  **`.age_in_years`**: We access the calculated `age_in_years` field. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these ages for all patients who met the filter criteria.",12.75018144,"# Calculate the average age of male patients with private insurance

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the average age).
2.  **`average_age=AVG(...)`**: We define the final output field `average_age` using the `AVG` aggregation function.

5.  **`.WHERE((gender == 'male') & (ins_type == 'Private'))`**: We then filter this collection of patients (who now have an `age_in_years` field) to include only those where `gender` is 'male' AND `ins_type` is 'Private'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_name=name`**: Selects the merchant's name.
3.  **`num_distinct_successful_tx=NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').txid)`**:
    *   Accesses the transactions received by the merchant (`transactions_received`).
    *   Filters these transactions to include only those with `status == 'completed'`.
    *   Counts the number of distinct transaction IDs (`txid`) within these successful transactions using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  **`num_distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').coupon.cid)`**:
    *   Again, accesses the successful transactions received by the merchant.
    *   Navigates to the associated coupon (`coupon`).
    *   Counts the number of distinct coupon IDs (`cid`) used in these successful transactions using `NDISTINCT`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the results from the first one.
6.  **`merchant_name=merchant_name`**: Carries forward the merchant name calculated in the previous step.
7.  **`cpur=IFF(num_distinct_successful_tx > 0, num_distinct_coupons_used / num_distinct_successful_tx, 0.0)`**:
    *   Calculates the CPUR (Coupon Usage Rate).
    *   Uses the `IFF` function to handle potential division by zero:
        *   If the number of distinct successful transactions (`num_distinct_successful_tx`) is greater than 0, it calculates CPUR as `num_distinct_coupons_used / num_distinct_successful_tx`.
        *   Otherwise (if there are no successful transactions), it assigns a CPUR of `0.0`.

    *   `.txid`: Accesses the transaction ID field.
    *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of successful transaction IDs for the merchant. We use `COUNT` assuming `txid` is unique per transaction.
4.  **`distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(...)`**: This calculates the numerator for CPUR.
    *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'successful') & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`: Filters the received transactions for those that are 'successful' AND have an associated coupon (`HAS(coupon) == 1`).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` field from these filtered transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s used in successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  **`cpur_rate=IFF(...)`**: This calculates the CPUR.
    *   `IFF(distinct_successful_tx > 0, ... , 0.0)`: Uses the `IFF` function to prevent division by zero. If the count of distinct successful transactions is greater than 0, it proceeds with the division.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used / distinct_successful_tx`: Performs the division to get the CPUR.
    *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions (`distinct_successful_tx` is 0), the CPUR is set to 0.0.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(merchant_name=merchant_name, CPUR=cpur_rate)`**: This final `CALCULATE` step selects only the `merchant_name` and the calculated `cpur_rate` (renamed to `CPUR`) for the final output, as requested.",26.01082420349121,"# Calculate CPUR for each merchant based on successful transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the `Ewallet` top-level collection:
    *   `current_week_start`: The start date of the current week (using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`).
    *   `three_weeks_ago_start`: The start date of the week 3 weeks prior to the current week (using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-3 weeks')`).
2.  **`filtered_notifications`**: We start with the `Notifications` collection, accessed via `date_boundaries` to inherit the calculated dates.
    *   We filter notifications based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   The associated user's country is either 'US' or 'Canada' (`ISIN(user.country, (""US"", ""Canada""))`).
        *   The `created_at` timestamp is on or after the start of the week 3 weeks ago (`created_at >= three_weeks_ago_start`).
        *   The `created_at` timestamp is before the start of the current week (`created_at < current_week_start`). This excludes the current week.
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to derive two new fields for each filtered notification:
        *   `notification_week_start`: Truncates the `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`. This will be our grouping key.
        *   `is_weekend_notification`: A boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the `created_at` date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
3.  **`weekly_notification_summary`**: We partition the `filtered_notifications` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(notification_week_start))`: This groups the notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` applied to these weekly groups:
        *   `week_start = notification_week_start`: We select the week's start date.
        *   `total_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications)`: We count all notifications within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_notifications_count = SUM(is_weekend_notification)`: We sum the `is_weekend_notification` flag. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in sums, this effectively counts only the notifications sent on weekends within that group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by week.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary time boundaries using `Ewallet.CALCULATE`. `start_of_current_week` is the beginning of the current week, and `start_of_3_weeks_ago` is the beginning of the week three weeks prior to the current week's start.
2.  **`filtered_users`**: We filter the `Users` collection to include only those whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA' using `WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`.
3.  **`relevant_notifications`**: We access the `notifications` sub-collection for the `filtered_users`. We then filter these notifications using `WHERE` to keep only those created within the desired time frame (`>= start_of_3_weeks_ago` and `< start_of_current_week`). Inside `CALCULATE`, we determine the start of the week (`notification_week`) for each notification using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')` and create a boolean flag `is_weekend` using `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`.
4.  **`weekly_groups`**: We partition the `relevant_notifications` using `PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=(notification_week))`. This groups the notifications based on the week they were sent.
5.  **`weekly_counts`**: For each partition (each week), we use `CALCULATE` to compute:
    *   `week_start_date`: The partitioning key itself (the start date of the week).
    *   `total_notifications`: The total count of notifications in that week's group, obtained using `COUNT(Notifications)`.
    *   `weekend_notifications`: The count of notifications sent on weekends within that week. This is calculated by summing the `is_weekend` flag (where True counts as 1 and False as 0) using `SUM(Notifications.is_weekend)`. We access the calculated `is_weekend` field through the `Notifications` sub-collection within the partition context.
6.  **`result`**: Finally, we select the required columns (`week_start_date`, `total_notifications`, `weekend_notifications`) and order the results by the week start date in ascending order for readability using `ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC())`.",31.06267166137696,"# Define the time boundaries for the last 3 weeks (excluding the current week)

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 6`: Filters transactions created within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date (`'now'`).

    *   `sending_user.country == 'US'`: Filters for transactions where the sending user's country is 'US'. It accesses the `country` field through the `sending_user` relationship.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures that the sender was indeed a user, not a merchant.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') < 7`: Filters transactions created within the last 7 days (0 to 6 days ago inclusive of today). `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's creation date (`created_at`) and the current moment (`'now'`). The condition `< 7` includes transactions from today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_user_settings = Users.setting_snapshots.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `setting_snapshots` for each `User`.
2.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: This ranks the snapshots based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest date gets rank 1).
    *   `per=""Users""`: This crucial part ensures the ranking is done *independently for each user*. Snapshots are only ranked against other snapshots belonging to the same user.
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the snapshot with rank 1, which is the latest one for that specific user.
3.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause guarantees that only one snapshot (the latest) is selected per user, we use `SINGULAR()` to treat the result as a single record within the context of each user.
4.  **`result = Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We then perform a `CALCULATE` operation on the `Users` collection.
5.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's ID (`uid`) and rename it to `user_id`.
6.  **`marketing_preference=latest_user_settings.marketing_opt_in`**: We access the `marketing_opt_in` field from the `latest_user_settings` (which we defined as the single, latest snapshot for the user) and assign it to the `marketing_preference` field in the output.

This query effectively retrieves the most recent marketing opt-in preference for every user by ranking their setting snapshots by date and selecting the top-ranked (latest) one.",20.6904296875,"# Find the latest setting snapshot for each user

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only merchants who have received at least one transaction with a `status` of 'completed'. This is checked using `HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed')) == 1`. Accessing `transactions_received` implicitly filters for transactions where the merchant is the receiver.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered merchants, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(...)`: Calculates the total revenue for each merchant by summing the `amount` of their received transactions that have a `status` of 'completed'.
3.  **`result = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the `merchant_revenues` collection to:
    *   Select the `merchant_name` and `merchant_category` again.
    *   Rename `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` as requested.
    *   Calculate the `revenue_rank` using the `RANKING` window function. `RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())` assigns rank 1 to the merchant with the highest `total_revenue`, rank 2 to the second highest, and so on, across all merchants in the `merchant_revenues` collection.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(revenue_rank.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are ordered by the calculated `revenue_rank` in ascending order, so the merchant with rank 1 appears first.",19.95650554,"# Calculate total revenue for each merchant from completed received transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, it calculates:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(...)`: Calculates the total revenue for the merchant. It does this by accessing the `transactions_received` sub-collection (transactions where the merchant is the receiver), filtering these transactions to include only those with `status == 'COMPLETED'`, and then summing their `amount`.

2.  **`result = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line takes the `merchant_revenues` collection (which now has name, category, and total revenue for each merchant) and adds the rank:
    *   It keeps the `merchant_name`, `merchant_category`, and renames `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` as requested.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())`: This applies the `RANKING` window function to the `merchant_revenues` collection. It ranks each merchant based on their `total_revenue` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered transactions, this step:
    *   Keeps the `sender_id` needed for the distinct count.

2.  **`user_transactions_in_period = time_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection based on the calculated time boundaries and the specified `sender_type`.
    *   `(created_at >= start_period) & (created_at < end_period)`: Selects transactions that occurred within the last two full months (excluding the current month).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users`**: We start with the `Users` collection, as the request focuses on users.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function is used to process each user record and derive new fields or select existing ones.
3.  **`user_id=uid`**: This selects the `uid` field from each user record and assigns it to the new field name `user_id` in the output.
4.  **`total_transactions_sent=COUNT(transactions_sent)`**: This calculates the total number of transactions sent by each user.
    *   `transactions_sent` is the sub-collection linking a user to the transactions they have sent.
    *   `COUNT()` is an aggregation function that counts the number of records in the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for the current user.
    *   The result of the count is assigned to the new field name `total_transactions_sent`.
5.  **`user_transaction_counts = ...`**: The final result, containing the `user_id` and `total_transactions_sent` for each user, is assigned to the variable `user_transaction_counts`.

This query iterates through all users and, for each one, counts how many transactions are listed in their `transactions_sent` list, effectively giving the total number of transactions sent by that user.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and rename it to `user_id` in the output.
3.  **`total_duration_seconds=SUM(...)`**: We calculate the total session duration for each user.
4.  **`sessions.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `SUM`, we access the `sessions` sub-collection for each user and filter them based on the `session_start_ts`. The condition `(session_start_ts >= ""2023-06-01"") & (session_start_ts < ""2023-06-08"")` selects sessions that started on or after June 1st, 2023, and before June 8th, 2023.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(session_duration=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`**: For each *filtered* session, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF` between the `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. This duration is temporarily stored in `session_duration`.
6.  **`.session_duration`**: We access the calculated `session_duration` for the `SUM` function to aggregate.
7.  **`).WHERE(HAS(...) == 1)`**: After calculating the sum, we filter the results to include only those users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range.
8.  **`.ORDER_BY(total_duration_seconds.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting collection of users by their `total_duration_seconds` in descending order, placing users with the longest total session duration first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We first determine the start date of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` and then calculate the start date of the previous month by subtracting one month using `DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-1 month')`.
2.  **Filter Transactions:** We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to the start of the previous month and less than the start of the current month).
3.  **Count Total Transactions:** We count the total number of transactions found within the filtered `transactions_previous_month` collection using `COUNT()`.
4.  **Count Successful Transactions:** We further filter the `transactions_previous_month` collection to include only transactions where the `status` is 'completed' (assuming this indicates success) and count these using `COUNT()`.
5.  **Calculate STR:** We calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR) by dividing the `successful_transactions_count` by the `total_transactions_count` and multiplying by 100.0 to express it as a percentage. We use the `IFF` function to check if `total_transactions_count` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero errors, returning 0.0 if there were no transactions.
6.  **Final Result:** The calculated STR percentage is assigned to the `previous_month_str_percentage` field within the top-level `Ewallet` context and stored in the `result` variable.",15.43767905,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the previous month

3.  **`transaction_counts`**: We calculate two values:
    *   `total_tx`: The total count of transactions found in the previous month.
    *   `successful_tx`: The count of transactions from the previous month where the `status` is 'completed' (assuming 'completed' signifies a successful transaction).
4.  **`previous_month_str`**: We calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR).
    *   We use the `IFF` function to check if `total_tx` is greater than 0.
    *   If `total_tx` > 0, we calculate STR as `(successful_tx / total_tx) * 100.0` to get a percentage. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and use `CALCULATE` to process each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_mid=mid, merchant_name=name`**: We select the merchant's `mid` and `name` and assign them to new variables for clarity and later use.
3.  **`num_coupons_same_month=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_coupons_same_month` for each merchant.
4.  **`coupons.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `COUNT` aggregation, we access the `coupons` sub-collection associated with the current merchant and filter them using `WHERE`.
5.  **`(YEAR(created_at) == YEAR(Merchants.created_at)) & (MONTH(created_at) == MONTH(Merchants.created_at))`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `YEAR(created_at)` and `MONTH(created_at)` extract the year and month from the *coupon's* `created_at` field (since the context inside `WHERE` is the `coupons` sub-collection).
    *   `YEAR(Merchants.created_at)` and `MONTH(Merchants.created_at)` extract the year and month from the *parent merchant's* `created_at` field.
    *   The condition keeps only those coupons created in the exact same calendar month and year as their parent merchant.
6.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of coupons that satisfy the `WHERE` condition for the current merchant.
7.  **`merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_same_month.DESC())`**: After calculating the count for all merchants, we use `TOP_K` to select the single merchant (`k=1`) who has the highest `num_coupons_same_month`. `DESC()` ensures we get the highest value.

3.  **`merchant_creation_year=YEAR(created_at), merchant_creation_month=MONTH(created_at)`**: Extracts the year and month from the merchant's `created_at` timestamp and stores them as new fields. These are needed for comparison within the sub-collection.
4.  **`num_same_month_coupons=COUNT(...)`**: This calculates the number of coupons associated with the current merchant that meet a specific condition.

6.  **`(YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month)`**: This is the filter condition. It checks if the `created_at` year and month of the *coupon* match the `merchant_creation_year` and `merchant_creation_month` calculated earlier for the *merchant*.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection based on several criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Ensures only transactions from the year 2023 are considered.
    *   `status == 'completed'`: Filters for successful transactions.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures the sender was a user, excluding merchants.
    *   `sending_user.status == 'active'`: Filters transactions where the sending user was active at the time (or based on their current status, depending on implementation details).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_date = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`: Extracts the date corresponding to the start of the month from the transaction's `created_at` timestamp. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `user_id = sending_user.uid`: Retrieves the unique ID of the sending user. This is needed to count distinct users later.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""monthly_data"", by=(transaction_month_date))`**: We partition the results based on the `transaction_month_date`. This groups all transactions that occurred within the same month.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each monthly partition (`monthly_data`), we calculate the final output fields:
    *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_date`: Selects the month date (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_active_users = NDISTINCT(monthly_data.user_id)`: Counts the number of unique `user_id` values within the current month's partition. This gives the count of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month_as_date.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the results in ascending order based on the `month_as_date`, ensuring the output starts from the earliest month in 2023.",29.58989024,"# Start with transactions and filter for relevant ones

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_in_2023 = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on several criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Filters transactions that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures that the sender was a user, excluding transactions sent by merchants.
    *   `status == 'completed'`: Includes only transactions that were successfully completed.
    *   `sending_user.status == 'active'`: Filters for transactions where the sending user has an 'active' status in the `Users` collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(transaction_month = ...)`**: For the filtered transactions, it calculates a new field `transaction_month` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `created_at` timestamp, formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". This format is suitable for grouping and ordering chronologically.
3.  **`monthly_active_users = transactions_in_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transactions_in_2023` collection into groups based on the unique values of `transaction_month`. Each partition (`monthly_group`) contains all the filtered transactions for a specific month.

1.  **`Coupons.WHERE(HAS(transaction_used_in) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Coupons` collection and filters to include only those coupons that have been used in at least one transaction.
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""coupon_group"", by=(code))`**: Groups the filtered coupons based on their unique `code`. Each group represents a distinct coupon code.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each coupon code group created by the partition:
    *   `coupon_code=code`: Selects the coupon code (which is the partition key).
    *   `total_redemptions=COUNT(Coupons.transaction_used_in)`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the coupons in this group (i.e., the total number of times this specific coupon code was redeemed).
    *   `total_amount_redeemed=SUM(Coupons.transaction_used_in.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions where this specific coupon code was used.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_redemptions.DESC())`**: Selects the top 3 resulting rows, ordered by the `total_redemptions` in descending order (most frequent first).
5.  **`top_coupons = ...`**: Assigns the final result to the variable `top_coupons`.

This query effectively groups transactions by coupon code, calculates the redemption count and total amount for each code, and then returns the top 3 codes based on the redemption count.",17.68606734275818,"top_coupons = Coupons.WHERE(HAS(transaction_used_in) == 1).PARTITION(name=""coupon_group"", by=(code)).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(HAS(transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)) == 1)`**: This filters the `Users` collection to include only those users who have sent at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_sent...`) where the `sender_type` is 0 (indicating the sender is a user).
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**: This groups the filtered users based on their `country`. Each group represents a unique country containing users who meet the initial criteria.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates aggregated values for each country group created by the partition:
    *   `country=country`: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_users=COUNT(Users)`: Counts the number of unique users within the current country group. Since we partitioned the filtered users, this gives the count of distinct users from that country who sent transactions with `sender_type = 0`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(Users.transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0).amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions sent (`transactions_sent`) by the users within the current country group, ensuring again that only transactions with `sender_type == 0` are included in the sum.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150)) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider merchants who have received at least one transaction (`transactions_received`) where the transaction's `created_at` date is within the last 150 days (inclusive) from the current time (`'now'`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150` calculates the difference in days and checks if it's 150 or less.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the merchants who passed the filter, we calculate new fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Renames the `name` field to `merchant_name`.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all `transactions_received` that fall within the last 150 days. The `WHERE` clause inside the `SUM` ensures only relevant transactions are aggregated.

3.  **`transactions_received.WHERE((DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150) & (receiver_type == 1))`**: Inside the `HAS`, `COUNT`, and `SUM` functions, we filter the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant. The filter keeps only transactions where:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150`: The transaction occurred within the last 150 days (inclusive). We use `DATEDIFF` to calculate the difference in days between the transaction's `created_at` timestamp and the current time (`'now'`).
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: The transaction's `receiver_type` is 1, explicitly matching the request, even though `transactions_received` implies the merchant is the receiver.

2.  `(merchant.status == 'active')`: This condition filters for balances belonging to merchants whose `status` field is exactly 'active'. We access the merchant's properties via the `merchant` relationship.
3.  `CONTAINS(merchant.category, 'retail')`: This condition further filters the balances, keeping only those whose associated merchant has a `category` field that includes the substring 'retail'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`snapshots_in_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only those records where the year of the `snapshot_date` is 2023.
2.  **`earliest_snapshots_in_2023 = snapshots_in_2023.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1)`**: This line takes the snapshots from 2023 and ranks them based on their `snapshot_date` in ascending order (earliest first). The `RANKING(...) == 1` condition filters the results to keep only the snapshot(s) with rank 1, which corresponds to the earliest date(s) in 2023. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest date, all of them are included.
3.  **`average_limits_result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result at the top `Ewallet` level.
    *   **`average_tx_limit_daily = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_daily)`**: It computes the average of the `tx_limit_daily` values from all the snapshots identified as the earliest in 2023.
    *   **`average_tx_limit_monthly = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_monthly)`**: Similarly, it computes the average of the `tx_limit_monthly` values from those same earliest snapshots.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection. It calculates two fields for each session:
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type`.
    *   `duration_in_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between the session end and start timestamps in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function and names this new field `duration_in_seconds`.
2.  **`avg_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the `session_durations` collection (which now includes the duration for each session) and partitions it.
    *   `name=""device_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(device_type)`: Specifies that the partitioning should be done based on the unique values found in the `device_type` field.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operates on each partition (each group of sessions with the same `device_type`).
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for the group (which is the partition key).
    *   `average_session_duration_seconds=AVG(session_durations.duration_in_seconds)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `duration_in_seconds` field for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. We access the previously calculated `duration_in_seconds` via `session_durations.duration_in_seconds`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line first accesses the `UserSessions` collection. It then uses `CALCULATE` to compute the duration of each session in seconds using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts`. It also explicitly includes `device_type` so it can be used as a partitioning key in the next step. The result is stored in the `session_durations` variable.
2.  **`session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the `session_durations` data and partitions it into groups based on the unique values in the `device_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `device_groups`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This `CALCULATE` operates on each partition created in the previous step.
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for the current group (which is the partitioning key).
    *   `avg_duration_seconds=AVG(UserSessions.session_duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `session_duration_seconds` (computed in the first step) for all sessions belonging to the current `device_type` group. We refer back to `UserSessions` within the aggregation to access the data belonging to the partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchants_with_coupons = Merchants.WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This line starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters it to include only those merchants who have at least one associated coupon, using the `HAS` function.
2.  **`qualifying_earliest_coupons = merchants_with_coupons.coupons.WHERE(...)`**: This accesses the `coupons` sub-collection for the filtered merchants.
3.  **`RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1`**: Inside the first `WHERE` clause applied to `coupons`, this `RANKING` function assigns a rank to each coupon *within its merchant group* (specified by `per=""Merchants""`), based on the `start_date` in ascending order. Filtering by `== 1` selects only the earliest coupon for each merchant.
4.  **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant.created_at, start_date) <= 365)`**: This second `WHERE` clause applies to the earliest coupons identified in the previous step.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: Starts with the `Merchants` collection and filters out any merchants that do not have associated coupons using the `HAS` function.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates intermediate values for each remaining merchant:
    *   `m_id=mid`: Stores the merchant's ID.
    *   `m_created_at=created_at`: Stores the merchant's registration date.
    *   `earliest_coupon=coupons.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1).SINGULAR()`: This finds the earliest coupon for the *current* merchant.
        *   `coupons`: Accesses the list of coupons associated with the merchant.
        *   `WHERE(RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: Filters these coupons. `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns a rank to each coupon based on its `start_date` (ascending), restarting the rank for each merchant (due to `per=""Merchants""`). We select the coupon with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which is technically a collection containing one coupon) into a single record so we can access its fields like `cid` and `start_date`.
3.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the merchants based on the date comparison:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", m_created_at, earliest_coupon.start_date)`: Calculates the difference in days between the merchant's creation date and the earliest coupon's start date.
    *   `( ... <= 365)`: Checks if this difference is 365 days or less.
    *   `& (earliest_coupon.start_date >= m_created_at)`: Ensures the coupon start date is on or after the merchant creation date.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
2.  **`HASNOT(...) == 1`**: This function checks if a sub-collection (in this case, filtered notifications) is empty. We want users for whom this condition is true.
3.  **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: For each user, we look at their `notifications` sub-collection and filter it.
4.  **`created_at <= DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')`**: This is the filtering condition for notifications. It compares the notification's `created_at` timestamp with a date calculated by adding one year to the user's `created_at` timestamp (their signup date). We keep notifications that occurred *within* or *on* the end date of the user's first year.
5.  **`HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: Putting it together, this checks if a user has *no* notifications that fall within their first year after signing up.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and apply a filter.
2.  **`COUNT(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 0`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: We look into the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, notifications.created_at) <= 365`: Inside the `WHERE` clause for notifications, we calculate the difference in days between the *user's* `created_at` date (the outer context) and the *notification's* `created_at` date. We keep only those notifications that occurred within 365 days (inclusive) of the user signing up.
    *   `COUNT(...) == 0`: We count how many notifications satisfy the condition above. The outer `WHERE` clause keeps only those users for whom this count is exactly zero, meaning they received no notifications within their first year.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who meet the filter criteria, we select and rename the required fields: `username` (as `user_name`), `email` (as `user_email`), and `created_at` (as `signup_date`).",14.403103590011597,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
