**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates:
        *   `c_name`: The customer's name.
        *   `num_total_transactions`: The total number of transactions made by the customer, using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `num_successful_transactions`: The number of successful transactions. This is calculated by counting transactions in `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `""Completed""`. **Note:** This assumes that a transaction status of `""Completed""` signifies a successful transaction, as the definition of ""success"" was not provided in the problem description.

2.  **`eligible_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`**:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It keeps only those customers who have `num_total_transactions` greater than or equal to 5, as per the requirement.

3.  **`customer_success_data = eligible_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `eligible_customers` and calculates their transaction success rate.
    *   It selects:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer (renamed from `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculated as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and performs floating-point division. Division by zero is not a concern here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures `num_total_transactions` is at least 5.

4.  **`ordered_customer_success_rates = customer_success_data.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, this step sorts the `customer_success_data` by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest), as requested.
    *   The `ordered_customer_success_rates` variable will contain the final list of customer names and their success rates, ordered appropriately.",31.627638816833496,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer.

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in conjunction with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol`.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering and then counting records from the `Customers` collection.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, obtained by using `Broker.CALCULATE`.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a tuple of FAANG stock ticker symbols. This is a contextless expression used for better readability in the query.
2.  `com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting the `Customers` collection and then applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the customer's `email` field ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`: This condition checks if the customer has at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) that involves a FAANG stock.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: This filters the customer's transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through `transactions_made.ticker.symbol`) is present in the `faang_tickers` list.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function returns true if the preceding filtered sub-collection (`transactions_made` for FAANG stocks) is not empty for the customer.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so a customer must satisfy both to be included.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_of_customers = COUNT(com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result. It uses the `Broker` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks)`: This counts the number of customers in the `com_email_customers_with_faang_stocks` collection (which contains customers who met the criteria).

1.  **Identify Stock Transactions**: Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
2.  **Calculate Week Information**: For each stock transaction:
    *   Determine the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. The definition of ""start of week"" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the system's date configuration.
    *   Flag whether the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.
3.  **Filter for the Target Period**:
    *   Establish the current week's start date: `current_week_start_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Define the date range for the 8 weeks of interest:
        *   The most recent week to include is ""last week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-1 week')`.
        *   The oldest week to include is ""8 weeks ago from the current week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-8 weeks')`.
    *   Filter transactions whose calculated `week_start_dt` falls within this range.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered transactions by their `week_start_dt`.
    *   For each week group, calculate:
        *   The total number of stock transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first calculate the start of the current week and the start of the last week. ""Last week"" is defined as the 7-day period starting from `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` up to, but not including, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call operates on the result of the first one.
    *   `customer_name=customer_name`, `num_transactions=num_transactions`, `total_trans_amount=total_trans_amount`: These fields are carried over from the previous calculation.
    *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount.DESC())`: This calculates the rank (`CR`) for each customer.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with `transaction_type` as ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred within the last 10 days. This is achieved by comparing the `date_time` of the transaction with the current date using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`.
3.  For these filtered transactions, we extract the `ticker.symbol`. We use `CALCULATE` to make this symbol available as a field.
4.  We then `PARTITION` these transactions by the extracted `transaction_ticker_symbol`.
5.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we `CALCULATE` the ticker symbol and count the number of transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`.

This period starts 6 months prior to the beginning of the current month and ends at the beginning of the current month. We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the start of the current month, and `DATETIME(..., '-6 months')` to calculate the start of the window.
2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this calculated time window.
3.  **Prepare for Grouping**: For each selected customer, we create a `signup_period_str` by combining their signup year and month (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent formatting.
4.  **Group by Signup Month**: We then `PARTITION` (group) these customers by their `signup_period_str`.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each signup month group:
    *   `PMCS`: Calculated as `COUNT(Customers)`, which counts the number of customers who signed up in that specific month.
    *   `PMAT`: Calculated as `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions made by all customers who signed up in that specific month and computes the average of the `amount` from those transactions.

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `active_with_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer's status is ""active"" AND they have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). Otherwise, it's `False`.
    *   `has_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer has made at least one transaction. Otherwise, it's `False`.
3.  We then partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `active_with_tx_bool` flag. This counts customers who are active and have transactions. This forms the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `num_total_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `has_tx_bool` flag. This counts all customers who have transactions. This forms the denominator of the AR formula.
    (We assume `SUM` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, consistent with PyDough examples like `SUM(cust_info.is_active)`).
5.  Finally, we calculate the Activity Ratio (AR) using the provided formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `num_total_customers_with_transactions` is zero (i.e., no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), setting AR to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

    *   For the state condition, convert the `state` field to lowercase using `LOWER()`. Then, check if it `ENDSWITH(""a"")`.
    *   Combine these two conditions using an AND (`&`) operator.
3.  Count the number of customers that satisfy these conditions using the `COUNT()` function.
4.  Assign this count to a field in a `CALCULATE` expression on the `Broker` (top-level) collection.

```python
filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(
    num_matching_customers=COUNT(
        Customers.WHERE(
            (
                STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"") | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")
            ) & 
            ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), ""a"")
        )
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

*   `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `Broker` collection to produce a single result.
*   `num_matching_customers=COUNT(...)`: We are calculating a new field `num_matching_customers` which will hold the count of the customers meeting the criteria.
*   `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter.
*   `STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), ""j"")`: Checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` starts with ""j"".
*   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), ""ez"")`: Checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` ends with ""ez"".
*   `(... | ...)`: The OR operator combines the two name conditions.
*   `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), ""a"")`: Checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `state` ends with ""a"".
*   `(... & ...)`: The AND operator combines the name condition (in parentheses) with the state condition.
*   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy the combined conditions within the `WHERE` clause.",12.525298833847046,"filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection to process each ticker individually.
2.  For each ticker, define a sub-collection `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. This sub-collection filters its `transactions_of` to include only those that:
    *   Have `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred on or after one month ago from the current date (`date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
3.  Filter out tickers that have no such sell transactions in the past month using `WHERE(HAS(sell_transactions_in_past_month) == 1)`.
4.  For the remaining tickers, calculate:
    *   `total_amount`: The sum of the `amount` from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`.
    *   `total_tax_comm`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. An inner `CALCULATE` is used to sum the combined `tax + commission` per transaction, adhering to PyDough syntax for expressions within aggregations.
5.  Calculate the `SPM` using the formula: `(total_amount - total_tax_comm) / total_amount * 100.0`.
    *   An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, setting SPM to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM`.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",116.09452176094057,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates the process by iterating through each customer.
    *   `num_transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: For each customer, this calculates the number of transactions they made in the same month and year they joined.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It accesses the list of transactions for the current customer and filters them.
        *   `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions occurring in the same calendar month and year as the customer's `join_date` are considered. `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions extract the respective parts from the date fields.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the transactions that satisfy the condition.
    The result of this step is a collection of customers, each with their original fields plus the new `num_transactions_in_join_month` field.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This takes the collection from the previous step and selects the top 1 customer.
    *   `by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC()`: The selection is based on the `num_transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order, so the customer with the highest count is chosen.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, name=name, number_of_transactions=num_transactions_in_join_month)`: This final step formats the output.
    *   It selects the `_id` and `name` (original fields from the `Customers` collection that were carried through).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(calculated_total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount))`:
    *   This part iterates through each customer in the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates the sum of the `amount` field from all their associated transactions (accessed via `transactions_made.amount`). This sum is stored in a new temporary field named `calculated_total_amount`.
    *   Other original fields of the `Customers` collection, like `name`, are implicitly available for subsequent operations.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=calculated_total_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This function takes the collection of customers (each now having the `calculated_total_amount`) and selects the top 5.

1.  **Filter Transactions by Date**: We start by selecting transactions that occurred within the specified date range. The `date_time` field will be used for this, ensuring we include transactions from January 1, 2023, up to and including March 31, 2023. We use `DATETIME(""2023-01-01"")` for the start and `DATETIME(""2023-04-01"")` for the exclusive end of the range.
2.  **Partition by Transaction Type**: The filtered transactions are then grouped (partitioned) by their `transaction_type`.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Type**: For each transaction type group, we calculate:
    *   `num_distinct_customers`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`.
    *   `avg_shares_val`: The average number of shares involved in transactions of this type. This is calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`.
    The partition key `transaction_type` is also carried forward as `transaction_type_val`.
4.  **Identify Top 3 Types**: We then select the top 3 transaction types based on the `num_distinct_customers`, ordered in descending order, using the `TOP_K` function.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(customer_id=customer_id)`**: Finally, this `CALCULATE` operation is applied to each group created by the `PARTITION`.

    *   This line starts with the `Tickers` collection.
    *   It calculates `num_transactions` by counting all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection for each ticker.
    *   It also calculates `total_transaction_amount` by summing the `amount` field from all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.
    *   The original `symbol` field from `Tickers` is implicitly carried forward.

2.  `top_10_tickers_by_total_amount = ticker_transaction_summary.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `TOP_K(10, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the `ticker_transaction_summary` and selects the top 10 records based on the `total_transaction_amount` field, sorted in descending order.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=symbol, number_of_transactions=num_transactions, total_transaction_amount=total_transaction_amount)`: This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers who have at least one transaction recorded in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: Selects the customer's `_id`.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: Calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This expression retrieves the date of the customer's first transaction.
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions. The `RANKING` function assigns a rank to each transaction based on its `date_time` (ascending). `per=""Customers""` ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer's set of transactions. We select the transaction(s) with rank 1 (the earliest).
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the previous filtering results in a single transaction record (the first one), allowing direct access to its fields.
            *   `.date_time`: Accesses the `date_time` field of this first transaction.",48.38526153564453,"customer_join_to_first_transaction_diff = Customers.WHERE(

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter this collection to include only customers who have at least one ""sell"" transaction recorded on the specific date ""2023-04-01"". We use the `HAS` function for this, checking the `transactions_made` sub-collection. The date is matched by comparing the `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DAY` of the `date_time` field.
3.  For the filtered customers, use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Select the customer's `_id`.
    *   Select the customer's `name`.
    *   Calculate `number_of_transactions` by counting their ""sell"" transactions on ""2023-04-01"". This involves filtering the `transactions_made` sub-collection again by `transaction_type` and the specific date.
4.  Use `TOP_K(1, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())` to find the single customer with the highest `number_of_transactions`. If there's a tie, one of the top customers will be returned. If no customer made any such transactions, the result will be empty.

```python
result = Customers.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

*   `Customers.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Customers` collection.

    *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(...))`: Counts the number of ""sell"" transactions on ""2023-04-01"" for that customer. The `WHERE` clause here is identical to the one in `HAS` to ensure the count is for the correct set of transactions.
*   `.TOP_K(1, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`: This takes the resulting collection of customers (those who made at least one relevant transaction) and their transaction counts, then selects the top 1 customer based on `number_of_transactions` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_prepared = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions in January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""completed""`: Filters for successful transactions. **Note:** We are assuming ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction. If ""successful"" corresponds to a different value in the `status` field, this condition should be adjusted.
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time), transaction_price_val = price)`: This selects and prepares the data needed for the next steps. It creates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from `date_time`, and it selects the `price`, renaming it to `transaction_price_val` for clarity.

2.  `monthly_average_prices = transactions_prepared.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `transactions_prepared` data and groups it.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups"", by=(transaction_month)`: Partitions the data by the `transaction_month`. Each group will correspond to a unique month (1, 2, or 3).
    *   `.CALCULATE(month_num = transaction_month, avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val))`: For each monthly group, this calculates:
        *   `month_num = transaction_month`: The month number for the group.
        *   `avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val)`: The average of `transaction_price_val` for all transactions within that specific month's group.

3.  `result = monthly_average_prices.CALCULATE(...)`: This line formats the final output.
    *   `month = month_num`: Selects the month number.
    *   `average_transaction_price = avg_price`: Selects the calculated average price and gives it the requested name.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Orders the final result by month in ascending order (January, February, March).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales based on two conditions combined with an `&` (AND) operator:
        *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This condition ensures that we only consider sales where the `make` of the associated `car` (accessed via `Sales.car.make`) is ""Toyota"".
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This condition filters sales that occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 29` ensures that sales from today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago are included, covering a 30-day period.

2.  **`toyota_sales_summary = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use `Dealership.CALCULATE` to create a result with aggregated values. `Dealership` is the top-level collection representing the entire database context.
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(filtered_toyota_sales)`: This calculates the total number of sales that met the criteria defined in `filtered_toyota_sales` and assigns it to the field `number_of_sales`.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(filtered_toyota_sales.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in `filtered_toyota_sales` and assigns it to the field `total_revenue`.

2.  In the first `CALCULATE` step:
    *   Select the `first_name` and `last_name` of the salesperson, aliasing them to temporary names (e.g., `sp_first_name`, `sp_last_name`) because they will be used in a subsequent `CALCULATE`.

**Explanation:**

The query starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
-   `sp_first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
-   `sp_last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
-   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made` sub-collection).
-   `calculated_num_sales`: The count of all sales associated with the salesperson.

The second `CALCULATE` then uses these intermediate values to produce the final output:
-   `first_name`: Renamed from `sp_first_name`.
-   `last_name`: Renamed from `sp_last_name`.
-   `total_sales_amount`: Renamed from `calculated_total_sales`.
-   `number_of_sales`: Renamed from `calculated_num_sales`.
-   `SR`: The sales rank, calculated using the `RANKING()` function on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order. This means salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank number.

Finally, `ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())` sorts the resulting list of salespersons by their sales rank in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",44.36732244491577,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

2.  **Create a Month Scaffold**: To ensure all relevant months appear in the result (even with zero metrics for specific salespersons), we first identify all unique months within this reporting period that had any sales activity globally. This is done by looking at all sales in the `Dealership.Sales` collection, filtering them by the reporting period, truncating their `sale_date` to the start of the month, and then finding the distinct months.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**: For each distinct month obtained from the scaffold:
    *   Identify sales made by salespersons who were hired between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023.
    *   Filter these sales to include only those that occurred within the specific month being processed.
    *   **PMSPS**: Count the number of such sales.
    *   **PMSR**: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales. If no such sales occurred, these metrics will correctly be 0.
4.  **Format and Order**: The month will be formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". The results will be ordered by month in ascending order.

2. For each payment, find its corresponding sale record using the `sale_record` relationship.
3. Calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Compute the average of these day differences across all payments.
5. Round the final average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

This approach calculates the average time lag for all payment events relative to their sale dates.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph to compute a single aggregate value.
2.  `AVG(...)`: This function will calculate the average of the day differences.
3.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `sale_record.sale_date`: Accesses the `sale_date` from the associated sale record.
    *   `payment_date`: Accesses the `payment_date` of the current payment record.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)`: Calculates the number of days between the sale date and the payment date for each payment. This result is named `days_difference`.
4.  `.days_difference`: This selects the calculated `days_difference` from the inner `CALCULATE` to be used by the `AVG` function.
5.  `ROUND(..., 2)`: The final average is rounded to 2 decimal places.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue for these sales by summing their `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost for these sales by summing the `cost` of the `car` associated with each sale.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.0`.
The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to yield a single GPM value.

```python
# Filter sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023

# Calculate GPM for the filtered sales

    gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`:
    *   This line creates a contextless expression named `sales_in_2023`.
    *   It filters the `Sales` collection to retain only records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.

2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database graph (`Dealership`). This is suitable for calculating a single aggregate value for the entire dataset.

3.  `calculated_total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`:
    *   Inside the first `CALCULATE`, this defines `calculated_total_revenue`.
    *   It computes the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records present in the `sales_in_2023` collection (i.e., sales from 2023).

4.  `calculated_total_cost = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`:
    *   This defines `calculated_total_cost`.
    *   It computes the sum of the `cost` of the cars associated with each sale in `sales_in_2023`. `sales_in_2023.car` navigates from a sale record to its associated car record, and `car.cost` accesses the cost of that car.

5.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`:
    *   This second `CALCULATE` operates on the output of the first one (which is a single row containing `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost`).
    *   `gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost`:
        *   This line computes the Gross Profit Margin using the GPM formula provided: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
        *   `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost` (derived in the previous `CALCULATE` step) are used here.
        *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures that the division results in a floating-point number and the final value is expressed as a percentage.
        *   The final GPM value is assigned to a field named `gpm_2023`.

    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change as follows:

1.  **Extract Date Parts**: First, it processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, it extracts the `pay_year` (year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (month of `payment_date`) using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions, respectively. This augmented data is stored in `payments_with_date_parts`.

2.  **Aggregate Monthly Payments**:
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` method to group the records in `payments_with_date_parts` by `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
    *   For each unique year-month group, it calculates `total_payments_this_month` by summing up the `payment_amount` of all payments belonging to that group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`. The result is stored in `monthly_aggregated_payments`.

3.  **Calculate MoM Change**:
    *   On the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection (which contains one record per year/month with total payments), it calculates the `mom_change`.
    *   The `mom_change` is computed as `total_payments_this_month - PREV(total_payments_this_month, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()))`.
    *   The `PREV()` function retrieves the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding record, determined by ordering records by `year_val` (ascending) and then `month_val` (ascending).
    *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV()` will return `None` (as there's no preceding month), resulting in `mom_change` being `None` for that first month.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the `final_monthly_payments_report` is ordered by `year` and then `month` in ascending order for a clear and chronological presentation.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current moment. If this difference is less than or equal to 6, it means the sale occurred today or in the preceding 6 days, covering a total of 7 days.
3.  Count the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.
4.  Assign this count to the alias `TSC`.

    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this `CALCULATE` function computes new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Stores the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Stores the salesperson's last name.

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as revenue is derived from sales.
2.  For each sale, we need the state of the customer who made the purchase. We can calculate a field `cust_state` representing `Sales.customer.state`.
3.  Partition the sales data by `cust_state`. This will group all sales by the state of the customer.
4.  For each state group, calculate:
    *   The name of the state (`state_name`), which is the `cust_state` itself.
    *   The number of unique customers (`unique_customer_count`) who made purchases in that state. This can be found using `NDISTINCT(Sales.customer._id)`.
    *   The total revenue (`total_sales_revenue`) from that state, calculated as `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
5.  Finally, select the top 5 states based on `total_sales_revenue` in descending order.

1.  Access the `Sales` data. For each sale, retrieve the make and model of the car involved.
2.  Group these sales by car make and model.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique car make and model):
    *   Calculate the total revenue by summing the `sale_price` of all sales in that group.
    *   Calculate the total number of sales by counting the sales records in that group.
4.  Order these car models by their total revenue in descending order.
5.  Select the top 5 models from this ordered list.
6.  Display the make, model, total number of sales, and total revenue for these top 5 models.

Here's the PyDough code to achieve this:

```python
# Step 1: Prepare sales data by adding car make and model information for partitioning.
# We create new fields 'car_make_val' and 'car_model_val' from the related car record.
sales_with_car_details = Sales.CALCULATE(

# The result will contain make, model, total_revenue, and total_sales_count for the top 5 models.
result = top_5_models_by_revenue
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_car_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to create two new fields: `car_make_val` (from `Sales.car.make`) and `car_model_val` (from `Sales.car.model`). These fields will be used as keys for partitioning. The original `sale_price` from `Sales` is implicitly available for aggregation.
2.  `model_sales_summary = sales_with_car_details.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We `PARTITION` the `sales_with_car_details` collection using `car_make_val` and `car_model_val` as partition keys. This groups all sales by their car's make and model.
    *   Within each partition group (each unique make/model combination), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `make = car_make_val`: The make of the car model for this group.
        *   `model = car_model_val`: The model of the car for this group.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` of all sales records belonging to the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that specific car model.
        *   `total_sales_count = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make/model group, representing the total number of units sold for that car model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue = model_sales_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: We then take the `model_sales_summary` (which contains aggregated data per car model) and use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 entries. The sorting is done by `total_revenue` in descending order (`.DESC()`), so the models generating the most revenue are ranked highest.
4.  `result = top_5_models_by_revenue`: The final result assigned to `result` will be a collection of the top 5 car models, including their make, model, total revenue, and total number of sales, as requested.",39.67116618156433,"# Step 1: Prepare sales data by adding car make and model information for partitioning.

2.  `num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`: This defines the field we want to calculate, which is the count of certain payments.
3.  `PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`: We start by accessing the `PaymentsMade` collection and then apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This is the first condition within the `WHERE` clause, filtering for payments made to 'Utility Company'.
5.  `& (ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday')))`: This is the second condition, combined with the first using `&` (AND).
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)`: This function extracts the name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
    *   We'll calculate the start date (Monday) and end date (Sunday) of the week immediately preceding the current week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week.
    *   Subtracting 7 days from this gives the Monday of the previous week.
    *   Subtracting 1 day from the Monday of the current week gives the Sunday of the previous week.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated previous week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   Extract the calendar day from `payment_date` (by truncating it to the start of the day) to ensure daily aggregation.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for further processing.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered and prepared payments by the extracted calendar day and `payment_method`.
    *   For each group (each day and payment method combination), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.

5.  **Select and Order Results**:
    *   The final output will include the transaction date (day), the payment method, and the total amount for that combination.
    *   The results will be ordered by date and then by payment method for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.
        *   `payment_amount_from_data = payment_amount`: Aliases `payment_amount` for clarity.

3.  `result = payments_for_grouping.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_extracted, payment_method_from_data))`: This groups the `payments_for_grouping` data. Each group will consist of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_extracted` and have the same `payment_method_from_data`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `transaction_date = payment_day_extracted`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_type = payment_method_from_data`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_by_method = SUM(payments_for_grouping.payment_amount_from_data)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount_from_data` for all payments within the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(transaction_date.ASC(), payment_method_type.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the transaction date in ascending order, and then by payment method type, also in ascending order. This makes the output easy to read.

1.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data**: We start with the `Sales` collection.
    *   Filter sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In a `CALCULATE` step, we retrieve the customer's state (`customer.state`) and determine the first date of the quarter for each sale. The quarter's first date (e.g., ""2023-01-01"" for Q1, ""2023-04-01"" for Q2, etc.) is calculated based on the `MONTH(sale_date)`. These derived fields will be used for partitioning.

2.  **Partition Data**: We then use the `PARTITION` method on the prepared sales data.
    *   The data is grouped by the calculated customer state (`customer_s`) and the quarter start date string (`quarter_dt_str`).

3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: Within each partition group (each unique combination of state and quarter):
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to output the customer's state and the quarter representation.
    *   We calculate the `total_quarterly_sales` by summing the `sale_price` of all sales belonging to that specific state and quarter using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`. The `Sales.sale_price` here refers to the original `sale_price` from the `Sales` records that match the initial 2023 filter and fall into the current partition group.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the results are ordered by customer state and then by the quarter start date for better readability.

```python
# Step 1: Filter sales for 2023 and calculate customer state and quarter representation string.

```
**Explanation:**

*   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Filters the `Sales` collection to include only records where the sale occurred in 2023.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for partitioning.
    *   `customer_s = customer.state`: Extracts the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `quarter_dt_str = IFF(...)`: Determines the first date of the quarter for the `sale_date`. For example, if a sale is in February 2023 (month 2), `quarter_dt_str` will be ""2023-01-01"".
*   `.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_sales_group"", by=(customer_s, quarter_dt_str))`: Groups the filtered sales data by the combination of the customer's state (`customer_s`) and the calculated quarter start date string (`quarter_dt_str`).
*   The second `.CALCULATE(...)` operates on each group created by the partition:
    *   `customer_state = customer_s`: Selects the customer state for the group.
    *   `quarter_representation = quarter_dt_str`: Selects the quarter start date string for the group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   We first establish the time window of interest: the last three full months, excluding the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt` marks the end of our window (exclusive).
    *   `three_months_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of our window (inclusive). These are calculated dynamically using `DATETIME('now', ...)` relative to the current date.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_in_period`)**:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the defined three-month window.
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered treatments:
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" is created from `start_dt` (e.g., ""2023-09"") to serve as a key for grouping treatments by month. `LPAD` ensures months are two digits (e.g., ""09"" instead of ""9"") for correct sorting.
        *   `p_id`: The `patient_id` is extracted.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment_flag`: A boolean flag is set to `True` if the treatment's associated drug (`drug.drug_type`) is 'biologic', and `False` otherwise.

3.  **Partition by Month and Aggregate (`monthly_aggregated_data`)**:
    *   The `treatments_in_period` data is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""treatments_per_month"", by=(treatment_month_year_key))`. This groups all treatments by their `treatment_month_year_key`.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes the required aggregates:
        *   `month_label`: This is the `treatment_month_year_key` (e.g., ""2023-09""), representing the month for which the counts are calculated.
        *   `distinct_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.p_id)` counts the number of unique patient IDs within that month's group. This gives the total number of distinct patients who received any treatment in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment_flag == True).p_id)` first filters the treatments within the monthly group to include only those where `is_biologic_treatment_flag` is `True`. Then, it counts the number of unique patient IDs from this subset. This gives the number of distinct patients who received at least one biologic drug treatment in that month.

4.  **Order Results (`result`)**:
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(month_label.ASC())` sorts the aggregated results chronologically by month.

The query will output three rows (one for each of the last three relevant months), each containing the month, the total count of distinct patients treated in that month, and the count of distinct patients who received biologic drug treatments in that month.",53.66024804115296,"# Define date boundaries for the last 3 months, excluding the current month

3. For each treatment, verify if the associated `diagnosis.diag_name` is 'Psoriasis vulgaris' AND the associated `drug.drug_type` is 'biologic'.
4. Count the number of patients for whom at least one such treatment exists.

The PyDough code will filter the `Patients` collection based on these conditions using the `HAS` function to check for the existence of qualifying treatments. Then, it will count the resulting patients.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_patients = Patients.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting from the `Patients` collection and applies a filter.
2.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the main filtering condition.
    *   `treatments_received`: Accesses the list of treatments for each patient.
    *   `.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))`: This nested `WHERE` clause filters the treatments. It keeps only those treatments where:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris'`: The name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
        *   `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`: The type of the drug used in the treatment is 'biologic'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: The `HAS` function checks if the filtered list of `treatments_received` (i.e., treatments meeting both criteria) is not empty for a given patient. If a patient has at least one such treatment, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this context).

3.  Next, we `PARTITION` the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection by `speciality`. We name these partitions `specialty_group`.
4.  After partitioning, we access the items within each `specialty_group` (which are the records from `doctors_with_drug_counts` belonging to that specialty).
5.  On these items, we use another `CALCULATE` to select the final fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`.
6.  In this final `CALCULATE`, we also compute `SDRSDR`. This is done using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `per=""specialty_group""` (meaning within each specialty), ordered by `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (so doctors prescribing more distinct drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., rank 1).

2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select `Treatments` whose `start_dt` falls within this calculated 12-month period.
3.  **Extract Year and Month**: For each filtered treatment, we create a standardized year-month string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") from the `start_dt`. This will be used for grouping.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the treatments based on this year-month string.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD**: For each month, we count the number of unique patients who received a diagnosis. Since each treatment is associated with a patient and a diagnosis, this is `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by calculating two key dates at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level:
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `twelve_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month that was 12 months before the current month.
2.  `relevant_treatments = date_boundaries.Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Treatments` collection and filter them. A treatment is included if its `start_dt` is on or after `twelve_months_ago_start_dt` AND before `current_month_start_dt`. This effectively selects all treatments from the last 12 full months, excluding any from the current month.
3.  `treatments_with_month_year = relevant_treatments.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of these `relevant_treatments`, we create a new field `treatment_month_year_str`. This string is formatted as ""YYYY-MM"" (e.g., ""2023-01"") by combining the year and the zero-padded month of the `start_dt`. This format is crucial for correct grouping and sorting.
4.  `monthly_metrics = treatments_with_month_year.PARTITION(...)`: We then partition (group) these treatments by the `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
    *   `month_year = treatment_month_year_str`: This carries over the year-month label for the output.
    *   `PMPD = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: This calculates the ""Per Month Patient Diagnoses"" by counting the number of unique `patient_id`s within each month's group of treatments. This assumes that each treatment implies a diagnosis for the patient.
    *   `PMTC = COUNT(Treatments)`: This calculates the ""Per Month Treatment Count"" by counting all treatments within that month's group.
6.  `result = monthly_metrics.ORDER_BY(month_year.ASC())`: Finally, the aggregated monthly metrics are ordered chronologically by the `month_year` string.",33.92883086204529,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the month 12 months prior

2.  **Filter for First Treatments**: Keep only those treatments that are identified as a patient's first treatment. Each record at this stage represents a patient becoming ""new"" to the system.
3.  **Determine Year of First Treatment**: For each of these first treatments, extract the year from its `start_dt`. This is the year the patient became a ""new patient"".
4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year.

1.  `valid_pasi_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE((HAS(day7_pasi_score) == 1) & (HAS(day100_pasi_score) == 1))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Outcomes` collection.
    *   It filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. The `HAS(field_name) == 1` condition checks for non-null values.
    *   The resulting collection, `valid_pasi_outcomes`, contains all outcome records suitable for the D7D100PIR calculation.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts a calculation at the `DermTreatment` (the top-level graph) context. This is appropriate for calculating global aggregates.
    *   `avg_overall_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_pasi_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_pasi_outcomes` collection.
    *   `avg_overall_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_pasi_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_pasi_outcomes` collection.

3.  `.CALCULATE(d7d100pir_percentage = ...)`:
    *   This subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on the results of the previous one (i.e., `avg_overall_day7_pasi` and `avg_overall_day100_pasi`).
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = (avg_overall_day100_pasi - avg_overall_day7_pasi) / avg_overall_day7_pasi * 100.0`: This applies the D7D100PIR formula. The division by `avg_overall_day7_pasi` and multiplication by `100.0` (to ensure floating-point arithmetic) yields the final percentage.
    *   The final output `result` will be a collection with a single row and a single column named `d7d100pir_percentage`, containing the calculated overall D7D100PIR.",45.882038831710815,"# Step 1: Filter outcome records to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

We need to return the drug's ID, name, and this count of adverse events.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to calculate the total number of relevant adverse events. This total will be a sum over all treatments associated with that drug.
3.  For each `treatment` associated with a drug (via `treatments_used_in`):
    a.  Determine the year and month of the treatment's `start_dt`. We'll create intermediate fields `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` for this.
    b.  Access the `adverse_events` for this specific treatment.
    c.  Filter these adverse events to include only those where the `reported_dt` falls within the same year and month as the treatment's `start_dt` (i.e., `YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr` and `MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth`).
    d.  Count these filtered adverse events for the current treatment. Let's call this `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`.
4.  Sum these counts (`count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`) across all treatments for the current drug. This gives the total number of relevant adverse events for the drug, which we'll call `num_adv_events`.
5.  After calculating `num_adv_events` for every drug, use `TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())` to find the drug with the highest count.
6.  The final result should include the drug's ID (`drug_id`), name (`drug_name`), and the calculated `num_adv_events`.

This requires nested calculations: an outer `CALCULATE` on `Drugs` to compute `num_adv_events`, and inner `CALCULATE` operations on `treatments_used_in` to determine the count for each treatment before summing them up. Due to the rule that new fields defined in a `CALCULATE` are only available after it completes, we'll need two chained `CALCULATE` calls on `treatments_used_in`.

```python
result = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    d_id = drug_id,
    d_name = drug_name,
    num_adv_events = SUM(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `d_id = drug_id`: Selects the drug's ID.
    *   `d_name = drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
    *   `num_adv_events = SUM(...)`: This calculates the total number of relevant adverse events for the current drug. The `SUM` function aggregates counts derived from each associated treatment.

2.  `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`: This first inner `CALCULATE` operates on the collection of treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `treatment_start_yr = YEAR(start_dt)`: Extracts the year from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_mth = MONTH(start_dt)`: Extracts the month from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    These fields (`treatment_start_yr`, `treatment_start_mth`) are now available for the subsequent `CALCULATE`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second inner `CALCULATE` (chained after the first one on `treatments_used_in`) still operates on each treatment.
    *   `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment = COUNT(...)`: For each treatment, this counts its adverse events that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   `adverse_events.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `adverse_events` sub-collection of the current treatment.
        *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth)`: This condition ensures that the adverse event's `reported_dt` is in the same calendar month and year as the treatment's `start_dt`.

4.  `.count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`: This refers to the result of the `COUNT` operation from the second inner `CALCULATE`. The `SUM` function in the outer `CALCULATE` (on `Drugs`) aggregates these per-treatment counts to get the total for the drug.

5.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())`: After calculating `d_id`, `d_name`, and `num_adv_events` for all drugs, this function selects the single drug that has the highest `num_adv_events`, ordering in descending order.",51.85069966316223,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

2.  `partitioned_by_insurance`: This takes the previously prepared `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(derived_ins_type))` groups the treatments based on the `derived_ins_type`. Each group (partition) will contain all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.

3.  `insurance_type_metrics`: This operates on the `partitioned_by_insurance` data.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes aggregate values for each insurance type group:
        *   `insurance_type = derived_ins_type`:  This selects the insurance type (which was the partition key) for the output, renaming it to `insurance_type`.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: This calculates the average `day100_pasi_score`. The `AVG` function operates on all `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.

Explanation:
-   `Doctors`: We start by referencing the `Doctors` collection.
-   `.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)`: This filters the `Doctors` collection. The `HAS(prescribed_treatments)` function checks if the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection (which represents a 1-to-N relationship) is not empty for each doctor. `== 1` ensures we only keep doctors who have prescribed at least one treatment.
-   `.CALCULATE(doc_id=doc_id, first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)`: This operation selects the specified fields (`doc_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`) for each doctor who met the `WHERE` clause condition. The result will be a collection of these doctors, and since `doc_id` is expected to be a unique identifier for doctors, the list will effectively be distinct by doctor.",14.668992519378662,"doctors_with_prescriptions = Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1).CALCULATE(

    *   **Drug Approval Condition**: The `drug` used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. This is checked by verifying that the `fda_appr_dt` field in the associated `drug` record exists (is not null) using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The `end_dt` of the treatment must be within the last 6 months from today. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to ""6 months ago"" and less than or equal to ""today"".
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions using the `COUNT()` aggregation function.
4.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, calculated on the `DermTreatment` graph.

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months
six_months_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-6 months')
current_date_val = DATETIME('now')

# Filter treatments based on the combined criteria
符合条件的治疗 = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &                        # Drug is FDA-approved (fda_appr_dt exists)
    (end_dt >= six_months_ago_date) & (end_dt <= current_date_val) # Treatment ended within the last 6 months
)

# Calculate the total count of such treatments
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(符合条件的治疗)

```
This PyDough code snippet first defines the relevant time window. Then, it filters the `Treatments` collection. A treatment is included if:
1. Its linked diagnosis's name (`diagnosis.diag_name`), when converted to lowercase, matches the pattern `'%psoriasis%'` (meaning it contains ""psoriasis"").
2. Its linked drug (`drug`) has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt` is not null).
3. Its end date (`end_dt`) falls between 6 months ago and today, inclusive.
Finally, it calculates the total number of treatments that meet all these conditions and assigns this count to `num_qualifying_treatments`.",27.652668476104736,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE(is_placebo == True)` to select only placebo treatments.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each selected placebo treatment.
4.  A second `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications. The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures that only medications started on or up to 14 days after the parent treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`) are included. `start_dt` here refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the parent placebo treatment.

    *   `concomitant_med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication (from its own `end_dt` field).

Explanation:
-   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want to compute a single aggregated value over the entire dataset.
-   `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'private'))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only male patients who have 'private' insurance. We assume 'private' is the value stored in the `ins_type` field for private insurance.
-   `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age.
    -   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This effectively gives the age in integer years.
    -   The result of this calculation is stored in a temporary field `current_age_in_years`.
-   `.current_age_in_years`: This accesses the calculated ages for the `AVG` function.
-   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients who met the filter criteria.
-   `ROUND(..., 0)`: This rounds the calculated average age to 0 decimal places, effectively providing an integer result as requested.

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions where `status == ""completed""` are successful and that these are typically `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Calculate the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This will be the numerator for CPUR. We'll use `NDISTINCT` on the `coupon_id` field of the successful transactions.
4.  Calculate the total number of distinct successful transactions. This will be the denominator for CPUR. We'll use `COUNT` on the successful transactions.
5.  Compute CPUR as `(number of distinct coupons used) / (number of distinct transactions)`.
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
7.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

This is achieved using a two-step `CALCULATE`:
*   The first `CALCULATE` computes the counts for distinct coupons and distinct transactions.
*   The second `CALCULATE` uses these counts to compute CPUR and selects the final required fields.

```python
# Calculate components for CPUR: distinct coupons used and distinct transactions for successful ones

    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
2.  `merchant_name=name`: We select the merchant's name.
3.  `num_distinct_coupons = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`:
    *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(status == ""completed"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those marked as ""completed"" (assumed to be successful).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` for each of these successful transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions. This gives the number of distinct coupons used.
4.  `num_distinct_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`:
    *   This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the results from the first:
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant name.
    *   `CPUR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_transactions > 0, ...)`: This checks if there are any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons / num_distinct_successful_transactions`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the total number of successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.
6.  `result`: The final variable `result` holds the merchant name and their calculated CPUR.",46.91513586044312,"# Calculate components for CPUR: distinct coupons used and distinct transactions for successful ones

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `current_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `three_weeks_prior_start_dt`: Calculates the start date of the week that was three weeks before the current week using `DATETIME(current_week_start_dt, '-3 weeks')`. This marks the beginning of our 3-week analysis window.

2.  **Filter Users**:
    *   `users_from_us_canada = Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`: Selects users whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.

3.  **Prepare Notifications Data**:
    *   `users_from_us_canada.notifications`: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for the filtered users.
    *   `.CALCULATE(notification_week_start_val = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week'))`: For each notification, it calculates `notification_week_start_val`, which is the date of the start of the week in which the notification was created. This aligns with the requirement to ""Truncate created\_at to week for aggregation"".

4.  **Filter Notifications by Time Window**:
    *   `relevant_period_notifications = ... .WHERE((notification_week_start_val >= three_weeks_prior_start_dt) & (notification_week_start_val < current_week_start_dt))`: Filters the notifications to include only those whose `notification_week_start_val` falls within the last three full weeks. The range is inclusive of `three_weeks_prior_start_dt` and exclusive of `current_week_start_dt`.

5.  **Group Notifications by Week**:
    *   `notifications_grouped_by_week = relevant_period_notifications.PARTITION(name=""notifications_in_week_group"", by=(notification_week_start_val))`: Groups the filtered notifications by their `notification_week_start_val`. Each group will represent a unique week.

6.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_start_for_group = notification_week_start_val`: Selects the week's start date (the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications within that weekly group. `Notifications` here refers to the original notification records belonging to the current group.
        *   `weekend_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))))`: Counts notifications within that weekly group that were created on a 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'. `DAYNAME(created_at)` extracts the name of the day of the week from the notification's `created_at` timestamp.

7.  **Order Results**:
    *   `final_weekly_summary = weekly_notification_counts.ORDER_BY(week_start_for_group.ASC())`: Orders the final results by the week start date in ascending order for readability.

Return the number of transactions and total transaction amount.,"SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_transactions, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t JOIN users AS u ON t.sender_id = u.uid WHERE u.country = 'US' AND t.created_at >= DATE('now', '-7 days') AND t.created_at < DATE('now', '+1 day');",Ewallet,"To determine the number of wallet transactions made by users from the US in the last 7 days (inclusive of today) and their total transaction amount, we can follow these steps:

1.  Filter the `Users` collection to select only users whose `country` is ""US"".
2.  Access the `transactions_sent` sub-collection for these US users to get all transactions they initiated.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days. This is achieved by comparing the transaction's `created_at` date with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`) using the `DATEDIFF` function. A transaction is within the last 7 days inclusive if the difference in days is less than or equal to 6.
4.  Finally, use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to compute two aggregates on this filtered set of transactions:
    *   The total number of transactions, using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of the `amount` for these transactions, using `SUM()`.

```python
# Identify transactions made by US users within the last 7 days (inclusive of today)
relevant_transactions = Users.WHERE(country == ""US"").transactions_sent.WHERE(
    DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6

# Calculate the number of these transactions and their total amount
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    num_transactions = COUNT(relevant_transactions),
    total_transaction_amount = SUM(relevant_transactions.amount)
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first defines `relevant_transactions`. This is achieved by:
- Starting with the `Users` collection.
- Filtering for users where `country == ""US""`.
- Accessing their sent transactions via the `transactions_sent` relationship.
- Further filtering these transactions to include only those where the `created_at` date is within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). The `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` condition ensures this:
    - If a transaction was today, `DATEDIFF` is 0.
    - If a transaction was 6 days ago, `DATEDIFF` is 6.
    - Both satisfy `<= 6`. Transactions 7 days ago or older will have a `DATEDIFF` of 7 or more, thus excluded.

Once `relevant_transactions` is defined, the `Ewallet.CALCULATE` function is used to compute the final aggregates:
- `num_transactions`: Counts the number of transactions in the `relevant_transactions` collection.
- `total_transaction_amount`: Sums the `amount` field of all transactions in the `relevant_transactions` collection.

The final output, stored in the `result` variable, will be a single record containing these two calculated values.",45.17957639694214,"# Identify transactions made by US users within the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

2.  **Calculate AMB per User**:
    *   The filtered balances are then partitioned by `user_id`. This groups all recent balance entries for each user.
    *   For each user group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute `user_specific_amb = AVG(UserBalances.balance)`. This calculates the average balance for each specific user based on their balance entries from the past week, fulfilling the definition of AMB for that user over the specified period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, it calculates the average of all these `user_specific_amb` values. This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `user_specific_amb` field from the collection generated in the previous step. The result is stored in a field named `average_balance`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for entries updated in the past week (inclusive of 7 days ago).

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each user.

    *   **`WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This window function is applied to the user's balances.
            *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: It ranks the balances based on the `updated_at` timestamp in descending order, so the most recent balance gets rank 1.
            *   `per=""Users""`: This ensures that the ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
        *   `== 1`: We filter the balances to keep only the one that has rank 1 (i.e., the most recent one).
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause (with `RANKING ... == 1`) is expected to return exactly one balance record for each user (their latest), `SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record context. This allows us to access its fields directly.
    *   **`.balance`**: From the singular latest balance record, we extract the actual `balance` value.

1.  Access each merchant's record.
2.  For each merchant, calculate their total revenue. Revenue is derived from transactions that were successfully received by them and where their `receiver_type` is 1. ""Successfully received"" typically means the transaction status is ""completed"".
3.  Rank all merchants based on this calculated revenue, with the highest revenue earning rank 1.
4.  Return the merchant's name, category, the calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Calculate total revenue for each merchant from specific transactions
merchant_revenue_data = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    # Store original merchant details for later use
    merchant_name_val=name,
    merchant_category_val=category,

    )
)

# Rank merchants by their calculated revenue and select the final output fields
result = merchant_revenue_data.CALCULATE(
    merchant_name=merchant_name_val,

    revenue_amount=revenue_val,
    # Rank merchants by revenue_val in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1)
    revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_val.DESC())
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: Stores the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category_val=category`: Stores the merchant's category.
    *   `revenue_val=SUM(...)`: This calculates the total revenue for the merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: This accesses the sub-collection of transactions received by the current merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (receiver_type == 1))`: This filters these transactions to include only those that are ""completed"" and where the `receiver_type` is `1` (as specified for merchants).
        *   `.amount`: This accesses the `amount` field of the filtered transactions.
        *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the amounts of these filtered transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant. If a merchant has no such transactions, `SUM` is expected to yield 0.

2.  `merchant_revenue_data.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first step and produces the final output.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: Assigns the stored merchant name to the output field `merchant_name`.
    *   `category=merchant_category_val`: Assigns the stored merchant category to the output field `category`.
    *   `revenue_amount=revenue_val`: Assigns the calculated revenue to the output field `revenue_amount`.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_val.DESC())`: This calculates the rank for each merchant.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: This is a window function that assigns a rank.
        *   `by=revenue_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the `revenue_val` calculated in the previous step, in descending order (so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1). This rank is assigned to the `revenue_rank` field.

What is the PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) for wallet transactions in the last 2 months excluding the current month?PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) = distinct sender with  sender_type = 0. Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",Ewallet,"The query calculates PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) for wallet transactions.
PMDAU is interpreted as the average number of daily active users over a month.
An active user on a given day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` with `sender_type = 0` who made a transaction on that day.

The calculation covers the last two full months, excluding the current month. For example, if the current month is July, the query will calculate PMDAU for May and June.

The process involves these main steps:
1.  **Define Date Range**: Establish the period of interest, which starts from the first day of the month two months prior to the current month and ends just before the start of the current month.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this defined date range and have a `sender_type` of 0.
3.  **Prepare Data for Daily Aggregation**: For each filtered transaction, extract or calculate:
    *   `calc_year_month`: The start of the month in which the transaction occurred (e.g., '2023-05-01' for any transaction in May 2023). This is used for the final monthly grouping.
    *   `calc_day_date`: The start of the day on which the transaction occurred (e.g., '2023-05-15 00:00:00' for a transaction on May 15th, 2023). This is used for grouping by day.
    *   `calc_sender_id`: The `sender_id` from the transaction.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transaction data by `calc_year_month` and `calc_day_date`.
    *   For each unique day (each group), count the number of distinct `calc_sender_id` values. This count represents the DAU for that specific day. The resulting collection, `daily_active_user_counts`, will contain records each representing a day, its month, and its DAU.
5.  **Calculate Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU)**:
    *   Group the `daily_active_user_counts` (from step 4) by `grouped_year_month` (which is the `calc_year_month` carried forward).
    *   For each month, calculate the average of all `daily_dau` values associated with that month. This average is the PMDAU for that month.
6.  **Format Final Output**: Present the results with columns for the month (`month`) and the calculated PMDAU (`pmdau`), ordered chronologically by month.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection to process each user.
2.  For each user, calculate the sum of durations of their sessions that fall within the specified date range.
    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).
    *   Filter these sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01T00:00:00"" and before ""2023-06-08T00:00:00"".

    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).
5.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `user_id` and `total_duration` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  `user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each user in the `Users` collection.
    *   `user_id_val = uid`: We store the user's unique identifier (`uid`) as `user_id_val`.
    *   `total_duration_val = SUM(...)`: For each user, we calculate the sum of session durations.
        *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the user's `sessions` (which are `UserSessions` records linked to this user) and filter them based on the `session_start_ts` to include only those within the range \[2023-06-01 00:00:00, 2023-06-08 00:00:00).
        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

    *   Calculate the sum of the `amount` from all transactions associated with that coupon. The `transaction_used_in` sub-collection of `Coupons` links to these transactions, and `amount` is a field in the `Transactions` collection.

This will result in a list where each entry contains a coupon ID and the total amount transacted using that coupon for merchant 1. If a coupon had no transactions, its total amount would be 0.

```python

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`**: This line defines a variable `one_month_ago_date` which represents the date and time exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`).
2.  **`current_date_val = DATETIME('now')`**: This line defines a variable `current_date_val` representing the current date and time.
3.  **`sessions_last_month = UserSessions.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sessions.
    *   The condition `(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_date) & (session_start_ts <= current_date_val)` ensures that we only include sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is on or after one month ago and on or before the current moment. This covers the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" requirement.
4.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(TUC = COUNT(sessions_last_month))`**:
    *   We use `Ewallet.CALCULATE` because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).

    *   The end of the previous month (exclusive) is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
2.  **Identify relevant transactions**: We'll filter the `Transactions` collection for entries that:
    *   Occurred within the defined ""previous month"" period (based on `created_at`).
    *   Are ""wallet transactions"". We'll assume this means `transaction_type == ""WALLET""`.
3.  **Count total and successful transactions**:
    *   Count all transactions matching the criteria from step 2 to get the `total number of transactions`.
    *   Among these, count those that were ""successful"". We'll assume this means `status == ""COMPLETED""` to get the `number of successful transactions`.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block defines two helper variables:
    *   `_previous_month_start_date`: The exact start timestamp of the previous calendar month.
    *   `_current_month_start_date`: The exact start timestamp of the current calendar month (which serves as the exclusive end for the previous month).
2.  The second `CALCULATE` block uses these date boundaries to count:
    *   `_total_wallet_transactions_previous_month`: The total number of transactions within the previous month that have `transaction_type` equal to ""WALLET"".
    *   `_successful_wallet_transactions_previous_month`: The count of transactions from the above set that also have a `status` of ""COMPLETED"".
3.  The final `CALCULATE` block computes the `str_for_wallet_transactions_previous_month`:
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_total_wallet_transactions_previous_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
    *   If there are transactions, it calculates STR as `(_successful_wallet_transactions_previous_month * 100.0) / _total_wallet_transactions_previous_month` to get a percentage.
    *   If there are no wallet transactions in the previous month, STR is set to `0.0`.

3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, for each merchant:
    *   We access their `coupons` sub-collection.

4.  Finally, we use `TOP_K(1, by=number_of_coupons.DESC())` to find the single merchant with the highest `number_of_coupons`. If multiple merchants share the top count, one of them will be returned.

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_date` in ascending order, presenting the data from the earliest month in 2023 onwards.

    *   Their `category` must contain the string ""retail"". We use `LOWER()` on the category and search for ""retail"" to ensure case-insensitivity.
    *   They must have at least one balance record. We use `HAS(balances) == 1` for this.

2.  **Determine the Latest Balance for Each Filtered Merchant**: For each merchant that meets the above criteria, we need to find their most recent wallet balance.
    *   Each merchant has a `balances` sub-collection (which are `MerchantBalances` records). Each record in this sub-collection has a `balance` amount and an `updated_at` timestamp.
    *   To find the latest balance, we use the `RANKING` window function on the `balances` sub-collection for each merchant. We rank these balance records by `updated_at` in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each merchant.
    *   We select the balance record where the rank is 1 (i.e., the most recent). `allow_ties=False` is the default, ensuring a single top record even if timestamps are identical (though this is unlikely for timestamps).
    *   `SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of the `WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)` clause as a single record, from which we extract the `balance` value.
    *   This latest balance is stored in a new calculated field, let's call it `current_merchant_balance`. This step results in a new collection (`merchants_with_latest_balance`) where each record represents a filtered merchant and includes their `current_merchant_balance`.

3.  **Calculate the Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` aggregation function is used on the `current_merchant_balance` attribute of the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `active_retail_merchants_with_balances`: This line filters the `Merchants` collection. It keeps only those merchants who are `active`, whose `category` (converted to lowercase) `CONTAINS` ""retail"", and who have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (`HAS(balances) == 1`).
2.  `merchants_with_latest_balance`: This line takes the previously filtered merchants and, for each one, calculates a new field `current_merchant_balance`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This part processes the `balances` sub-collection of each merchant. `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns a rank to each balance entry based on its `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (most recent first). The ranking is done `per=""Merchants""`, meaning it's reset for each merchant. We then filter for the entry with rank 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR().balance`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should identify a single latest balance entry per merchant, `SINGULAR()` converts this to a single record context, and `.balance` extracts the actual balance amount.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step calculates the overall median.
    *   `MEDIAN(merchants_with_latest_balance.current_merchant_balance)`: This computes the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values collected from the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection. If any merchant had no balances (though filtered out by `HAS(balances)`), or if the `current_merchant_balance` ended up null for any reason, `MEDIAN` would ignore these null values.
    *   The result is stored in a field named `median_wallet_balance` within a single-row collection derived from `Ewallet` (the top-level graph object).",66.76602053642273,"# Step 1: Filter merchants who are active, in 'retail' category, and have balance records.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line processes the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `p_device_type = device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for each session and assigns it to a new field `p_device_type`. This field will be used as the key for partitioning.
    *   `duration_in_seconds = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in the `duration_in_seconds` field.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_grouped_by_device"", by=(p_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `p_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_grouped_by_device`.

3.  For the remaining merchants, use `CALCULATE` to:

This is done by accessing the `coupons` sub-collection, ordering them by `start_date` in ascending order, taking the top one using `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`, and then converting this single-item collection to a singular record using `.SINGULAR()`. This record is stored as `earliest_coupon_record`.
4.  Filter these merchants further using `WHERE`. The condition checks if the `start_date` of the `earliest_coupon_record` is:
    *   On or after the merchant's registration date (`earliest_coupon_record.start_date >= merchant_reg_date`).
    *   Within one year of the merchant's registration date. This is checked by ensuring the coupon's start date is less than or equal to the registration date plus one year (`earliest_coupon_record.start_date <= DATETIME(merchant_reg_date, '1 year')`).
