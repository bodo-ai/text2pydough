**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_transaction_counts = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   Starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   Filters customers using `WHERE` to include only those with 5 or more transactions (`COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5`).
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` to compute:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer.
        *   `total_trans`: The total number of transactions made by the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `successful_trans`: The number of successful transactions. This is done by counting transactions within `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `'Completed'`. **Note:** This assumes 'Completed' signifies a successful transaction; this value might need adjustment based on the actual data.

2.  **`customer_success_rates = customer_transaction_counts.CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`**:
    *   Takes the intermediate result `customer_transaction_counts`.
    *   Uses another `CALCULATE` to compute the `success_rate`. It divides the `successful_trans` by `total_trans` (calculated in the previous step) and multiplies by `100.0` to get a percentage. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division.
    *   Selects the final required fields: `customer_name` and the calculated `success_rate`.
    *   Uses `ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())` to sort the results based on the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).",23.30759788,"# Calculate transaction counts for customers with at least 5 transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`faang_symbols = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`**: This line defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies for easy reference.
2.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies filters using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  **`(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`**: This condition filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
4.  **`&`**: This logical operator combines the email filter with the transaction filter, requiring both to be true.
5.  **`(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols))) == 1)`**: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction (`HAS(...) == 1`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Window:**
    *   `start_period_date` is calculated as the start of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week's start using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-8 weeks')`.
    *   `end_period_date` is calculated as the start of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. This ensures the current week is excluded.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Transactions:**
    *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `Transactions` collection to include only records where `date_time` falls within the calculated `start_period_date` (inclusive) and `end_period_date` (exclusive).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction:
        *   `week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: Calculates the starting date of the week the transaction occurred in.
        *   `is_weekend_transaction = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Determines if the transaction occurred on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`, resulting in a boolean (True/False) or equivalent integer (1/0).

3.  **Partition by Week:**
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_groups"", by=(week_start))`: Groups the prepared transaction data (`transactions_in_period`) into partitions based on the unique `week_start` date.

4.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates:**
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: Operates on each partition (each week):
        *   `week_starting = week_start`: Selects the week's starting date (the partition key).
        *   `total_transactions_count = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific week's partition.
        *   `weekend_transactions_count = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction` flag (treating True as 1 and False as 0) for transactions within that week's partition to get the count of weekend transactions.

5.  **Order Results:**
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries in ascending order based on the `week_starting` date.

6.  **Assign Result:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:**
    *   `start_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week prior to the current one. It takes the current timestamp (`'now'`), finds the start of the current week (`'start of week'`), and subtracts 7 days (`'-7 days'`).
    *   `end_of_last_week`: Calculates the timestamp marking the end of last week, which is exactly the start of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`).
2.  **Filter Transactions:**
    *   Starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Uses `WHERE` to apply filters:
        *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Selects transactions linked to customers whose country is ""USA"".
        *   `date_time >= start_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction date is on or after the start of last week.
        *   `date_time < end_of_last_week`: Ensures the transaction date is before the start of the current week (effectively including only dates within last week).
    *   The result of this filtering is assigned to `usa_last_week_transactions`.
3.  **Calculate Aggregates:**
    *   Uses the top-level `Broker` collection's `CALCULATE` method to compute the final results based on the filtered transactions.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(usa_last_week_transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions in the filtered set.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(usa_last_week_transactions.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field for all transactions in the filtered set.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This variable filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `WHERE(...)`: It keeps only transactions where:
        *   `transaction_type == 'buy'`: The transaction is a buy.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, DATETIME('now')) <= 10`: The difference in days between the transaction's `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 10 days or less.
    *   `CALCULATE(ticker_sym = ticker.symbol)`: It extracts the stock ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`) from the related `ticker` record and assigns it to a new field `ticker_sym` to be used for grouping.

2.  **`ticker_groups`**: This variable takes the filtered transactions and groups them.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""ticker_group"", by=(ticker_sym))`: It partitions (groups) the `recent_buy_transactions` based on the unique values of `ticker_sym`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_sym`: It outputs the ticker symbol.
        *   `num_buy_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: It counts the number of transactions belonging to that specific ticker symbol group within the filtered set.

3.  **`top_2_frequent_tickers`**: This variable selects the top results.
    *   `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())`: It selects the top 2 rows from `ticker_groups`, ordered by `num_buy_transactions` in descending order (most frequent first).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`time_boundaries = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first define the time boundaries using the `Broker` high-level collection. `current_month_start` is calculated as the first moment of the current month, and `six_months_ago_start` is calculated as the first moment of the month that was 6 months before the current month.
2.  **`customers_in_period = time_boundaries.Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls within the calculated time range (greater than or equal to `six_months_ago_start` and less than `current_month_start`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(signup_month = ...)`**: For the filtered customers, we create a new field `signup_month` by concatenating the year and zero-padded month from their `join_date`, resulting in a 'YYYY-MM' format suitable for grouping.
4.  **`monthly_customer_metrics = customers_in_period.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `customers_in_period` collection using the `signup_month` as the key. This groups customers based on the month they signed up.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each partition (each signup month):
    *   `signup_month = signup_month`: We include the signup month in the output.
    *   `pmcs = COUNT(Customers)`: We calculate the Per Month Customer Signups (PMCS) by counting the number of `Customers` records within the current partition group.
    *   `pmat = AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`: We calculate the Per Month Average Transaction amount (PMAT) by taking the average of the `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the customers within the current partition group.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`**: The final results are ordered chronologically by the signup month.
7.  **`result = monthly_customer_metrics`**: The final calculated metrics per signup month are assigned to the `result` variable.",23.21811628,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the month 6 months prior

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_data = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `DailyPrices` collection. We use `CALCULATE` to bring the `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record into the current context and keep the `date` field, renaming them `ticker_type` and `price_date` respectively.
2.  **`recent_prices = price_data.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `price_data` to include only records where the `price_date` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATEDIFF(""days"", price_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between the `price_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) and keeping records where this difference is 6 or less (covering today and the previous 6 days).
3.  **`ticker_type_groups = recent_prices.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `recent_prices` based on the `ticker_type`. This groups all the price records from the last 7 days by their corresponding ticker type. Each group is named `type_group`.
4.  **`acp_by_type = ticker_type_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition group (each unique `ticker_type`), we calculate the final result.
    *   `ticker_type=ticker_type`: We select the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key).
    *   `ACP=AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: We calculate the Average Closing Price (ACP) by applying the `AVG` aggregation function to the `close` field of the `DailyPrices` records belonging to the current partition group (which already contains only prices from the last 7 days for that specific ticker type).",25.7808342,"# Calculate ticker_type and store the date for filtering

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022`**: Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is in the year 2022.
2.  **`customer_info`**: Calculates two boolean flags for each customer from `customers_2022`:
    *   `has_transactions`: True if the customer has at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
    *   `is_active`: True if the customer's `status` is 'Active'. It also selects the `country`.
3.  **`customers_with_transactions`**: Filters `customer_info` to keep only those customers who have transactions (`has_transactions == 1`). These are the customers relevant for the AR calculation's denominator.
4.  **`country_groups`**: Partitions the `customers_with_transactions` collection by `country`. This groups the relevant customers based on their country.
5.  **`country_ar_calcs`**: Calculates aggregates for each country group:
    *   `country`: The country name (partition key).
    *   `total_with_trans`: Counts the total number of customers within that country group (all of whom joined in 2022 and have transactions).
    *   `active_with_trans`: Sums the `is_active` flag for customers in the group, effectively counting the active customers with transactions.
6.  **`result`**: Calculates the final `activity_ratio` (AR) for each country using the formula provided in the request: `100.0 * active_with_trans / total_with_trans`. The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_with_trans` might be zero (although unlikely due to the earlier filter) to prevent division by zero, returning 0.0 in that case.

4.  **`(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`**: This is the first condition.
    *   `LOWER(name)`: Converts the customer's `name` to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.

    *   `ENDSWITH(..., 'ez')`: Checks if the lowercase name ends with 'ez'.
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines these two checks, so the customer's name must satisfy at least one of them.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This is the second condition.
    *   `LOWER(state)`: Converts the customer's `state` to lowercase.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sell_transactions_last_month = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `transaction_type == 'sell'`: It selects only transactions where the type is 'sell'.
    *   `date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: It further filters these transactions to include only those that occurred on or after the date exactly one month prior to the current time (`'now'`).
2.  **`ticker_spm_calculation = sell_transactions_last_month.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the filtered sell transactions.
    *   `name=""ticker_group""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(ticker.symbol)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique stock ticker symbol associated with each transaction (`ticker.symbol`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the required values for each ticker symbol group created by the partition.
    *   `ticker_symbol=ticker.symbol`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `spm=IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin (SPM).
        *   `SUM(Transactions.amount)`, `SUM(Transactions.tax)`, `SUM(Transactions.commission)`: These calculate the total amount, tax, and commission for all 'sell' transactions *within the current ticker symbol group* over the specified period.
        *   `(SUM(Transactions.amount) - (SUM(Transactions.tax) + SUM(Transactions.commission))) * 100.0 / SUM(Transactions.amount)`: This applies the SPM formula using the aggregated sums for the group. `100.0` is used to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.
        *   `IFF(SUM(Transactions.amount) == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This handles the edge case where a ticker might have sell transactions with a total amount of zero within the period. In such cases, it assigns an SPM of `0.0` to avoid division by zero errors.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info = DailyPrices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `DailyPrices` collection. It calculates a `month_str` in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` for consistent grouping and sorting. It also retrieves the `symbol` from the related `ticker` record. The original `close`, `high`, and `low` values remain accessible for later aggregation.
2.  **`ticker_monthly_groups = price_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `price_info` data first by `symbol` and then by the calculated `month_str`. This creates groups for each unique ticker-month combination.
3.  **`monthly_aggregates = ticker_monthly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each ticker-month partition, this step calculates the required aggregates: `avg_close` (average of `DailyPrices.close`), `max_high` (maximum of `DailyPrices.high`), and `min_low` (minimum of `DailyPrices.low`). It retains the `symbol` and `month` (renamed from `month_str`) keys.
4.  **`result = monthly_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is the final calculation step applied to the monthly aggregated data.
    *   It keeps the `symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low`.
    *   It uses the `PREV(avg_close, by=month.ASC(), per=""symbol"")` window function. This function looks at the previous record within the *same symbol's data* (due to `per=""symbol""`), ordered chronologically by `month` (due to `by=month.ASC()`), and retrieves its `avg_close` value.
    *   It calculates `momc` (Month-over-Month Change) using the formula `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles edge cases: if `prev_month_avg_close` is `None` (i.e., it's the first month for that ticker) or if it's `0` (to prevent division by zero), `momc` is set to `None`; otherwise, the calculation proceeds.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(symbol.ASC(), month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted alphabetically by ticker `symbol` and then chronologically by `month`.",50.87489057,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string and ticker symbol

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ticker_data = Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection. For each ticker, we calculate:
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the stock's symbol.
    *   `prices_in_range=historical_prices.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `historical_prices` sub-collection to include only records where the `date` is between ""2023-04-01"" and ""2023-04-04"", inclusive.
    *   `max_high_period=MAX(prices_in_range.high)`: Finds the highest `high` price among the filtered `prices_in_range` for that specific ticker.
    *   `min_low_period=MIN(prices_in_range.low)`: Finds the lowest `low` price among the filtered `prices_in_range` for that specific ticker.
2.  **`price_changes = ticker_data.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the results of the first one. This allows us to use the `max_high_period` and `min_low_period` calculated previously.
    *   `ticker_symbol=ticker_symbol`: Keeps the ticker symbol.
    *   `price_change=max_high_period - min_low_period`: Calculates the difference between the maximum high and minimum low found in the date range for each ticker.
    *   `.WHERE(price_change != None)`: Filters out any results where `price_change` is null, which would happen if a ticker had no price data within the specified date range.
3.  **`top_3_stocks_by_price_change = price_changes.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: This selects the top 3 records from the `price_changes` collection, ordered by the `price_change` field in descending order (highest change first).

It filters the `transactions_made` for each customer, keeping only those where the transaction's `YEAR(date_time)` and `MONTH(date_time)` match the customer's `join_yr` and `join_mth`. It then counts these filtered transactions using `COUNT()` and assigns the result to `num_transactions_in_join_month`.
3.  `TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())` selects the single customer record with the highest count of transactions made in their joining month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Transactions` collection. For each transaction, we navigate to the linked `customer` to get their `state` and to the linked `ticker` to get its `ticker_type`. We assign these to new temporary fields `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
2.  **`.PARTITION(...)`**: We then partition (group) the results based on the unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. Each group in the partition represents one unique combination.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each partition group (each unique state/ticker type combination), we calculate:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: We select the state from the partition key.
    *   `ticker_type=tick_type`: We select the ticker type from the partition key.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only transactions where the difference in days between the `date_time` and the current time (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. It then uses `CALCULATE` to extract the customer's country (`customer.country`) into a new field `cust_country` (needed for partitioning) and keeps the transaction `amount` as `trans_amount`.
2.  **`country_groups`**: This partitions the `recent_transactions` based on the `cust_country`. For each country group, it calculates:
    *   `country_name`: The name of the country (from the partition key `cust_country`).
    *   `num_transactions`: The total count of transactions within that country group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of transaction amounts (`amount`) for that country group using `SUM(Transactions.amount)`.
3.  **`top_5_countries_by_amount`**: This takes the `country_groups` results and selects the top 5 rows based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order using `TOP_K`. It then uses `CALCULATE` to select the final required fields: `country_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_transaction_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range:** We first define the time window for the ""past 7 days"". `start_date_past_7_days` is calculated as 7 days before the start of the current day, and `end_date_past_7_days` is the start of the current day. This ensures we look at the 7 full calendar days preceding today.
2.  **Filter Ticker:** We start with the `Tickers` collection and use `WHERE` to filter for the specific ticker symbol `'VTI'`.
3.  **Calculate Minimum Price:** We use `CALCULATE` on the filtered ticker.
    *   `symbol=symbol`: We include the symbol in the output for clarity.
    *   `lowest_close_price=MIN(...)`: We calculate the minimum closing price.
        *   `historical_prices`: We access the related daily prices for the 'VTI' ticker.
        *   `.WHERE(...)`: We filter these daily prices to include only those where the `date` is greater than or equal to the `start_date_past_7_days` and less than the `end_date_past_7_days`.
        *   `.close`: We specify that we want to operate on the `close` field of the filtered daily prices.
        *   `MIN()`: This aggregation function finds the minimum value among the closing prices of the filtered records.
4.  **Assign Result:** The final calculation containing the symbol and its lowest closing price in the specified period is assigned to the `result` variable.",20.35379529,"import datetime

1.  `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This selects only the customers who have at least one transaction associated with them by checking if the `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each selected customer.
3.  `customer_id=_id`: Selects the customer's unique identifier (`_id`) and renames it to `customer_id`.
4.  `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: For each customer, this finds the minimum (earliest) `date_time` among all their transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
5.  `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`: This calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and the earliest transaction date found in the previous step.
6.  `time_to_first_transaction_days=...`: Assigns the calculated difference to the field `time_to_first_transaction_days`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_filter`**: This defines a reusable condition to identify transactions that are of type 'sell' and occurred exactly on the date '2023-04-01' by checking the year, month, and day components of the `date_time` field.
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Customers` collection to keep only those who have at least one transaction matching the `transaction_filter`. The `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(transaction_filter)) == 1` check ensures we only consider customers who actually made relevant transactions.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates:
    *   `customer_id`: Renames the `_id` field.
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `transaction_count`: Counts the number of transactions associated with the customer (`transactions_made`) that satisfy the `transaction_filter`.
4.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())`**: This selects the single customer (`1`) who has the highest `transaction_count`. The `.DESC()` ensures that the customer with the most transactions is ranked first.
5.  **`result = top_customer_by_transactions`**: The final result containing the `_id`, `name`, and transaction count of the top customer is assigned to the `result` variable.",21.45983171,"# Define the filter condition for transactions made on 2023-04-01 with type 'sell'

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step starts with the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on three conditions using `WHERE`:
    *   `status == ""Success""`: Selects only transactions marked as successful.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), representing the first quarter.
    *   It then uses `CALCULATE` to create a new field `transaction_month_str` by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) into a 'YYYY-MM' format (e.g., ""2023-01""). This standardized string will be used for grouping.

2.  **`monthly_groups`**: This step takes the `filtered_transactions` and partitions them using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""monthly_trans""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created within the partition context.
    *   `by=(transaction_month_str)`: Groups the transactions based on the unique values of the `transaction_month_str` field created in the previous step.

3.  **`monthly_average_prices`**: This step operates on the partitioned data (`monthly_groups`).
    *   It uses `CALCULATE` to compute the final results for each group (each month).
    *   `month=transaction_month_str`: Selects the month string (the partition key) for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price=AVG(Transactions.price)`: Calculates the average of the `price` field for all transactions belonging to that specific month's group. Note that `Transactions.price` refers back to the `price` field within the `Transactions` collection associated with each partition group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final result chronologically by month.

result = weekly_payment_counts.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate two key dates using the `Dealership` high-level collection:
    *   `current_week_start`: The exact date/time representing the beginning of the current calendar week (e.g., the most recent Monday or Sunday at 00:00, depending on system configuration).
    *   `start_date`: The date exactly 8 weeks before `current_week_start`. This defines the beginning of our 8-week analysis window.
2.  **`payments_in_period`**: This expression chain filters and prepares the payment data:
    *   `date_boundaries.Sales.WHERE(sale_price > 30000)`: Selects only sales records where the `sale_price` exceeds $30,000.
    *   `.payment`: Accesses the list of associated `PaymentsReceived` records for these high-value sales.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= start_date) & (payment_date < current_week_start))`: Filters these payments to include only those made within our target 8-week window (from `start_date` up to, but not including, `current_week_start`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each payment within the timeframe:
        *   `payment_week_start=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')`: Calculates the start date of the calendar week in which the payment occurred. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend=ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the payment date falls on a Saturday or Sunday using `DAYNAME` and `ISIN`. This creates a boolean flag (`True` if weekend, `False` otherwise).
3.  **`weekly_payment_counts`**: This performs the aggregation:
    *   `payments_in_period.PARTITION(name=""weeks"", by=payment_week_start)`: Groups the prepared payment records based on the `payment_week_start` date. All payments from the same calendar week will be in the same group.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group created by the partition:
        *   `week=payment_week_start`: Includes the week's start date in the output.
        *   `total_payments_received=COUNT(payments_in_period)`: Counts the total number of payment records within that specific week's group.
        *   `weekend_payments_received=SUM(payments_in_period.is_weekend)`: Sums the `is_weekend` flag for all payments in the group. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this effectively counts the weekend payments.
4.  **`result`**:
    *   `weekly_payment_counts.ORDER_BY(week.ASC())`: Sorts the final weekly summaries by the `week` start date in ascending chronological order.

The final `result` variable holds a collection where each record represents one of the last 8 full calendar weeks, containing the week's start date, the total number of payments received for sales over $30k during that week, and the count of those payments that occurred on a weekend.",36.06197596,"# Calculate the start date of the current week and the start date 8 weeks prior.

3.  **`num_sales=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_sales`.
4.  **`sales_made.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `sales_made` sub-collection (which contains all sales for the current salesperson) and filter it using `WHERE`.
5.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`**: This condition filters the sales.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
    *   **`LIKE(UPPER(vin_number), '%M5%')`**: This condition filters cars where the `vin_number`, converted to uppercase using `UPPER()`, contains the substring 'M5'. The `LIKE` function with `%` wildcards allows for partial matching. This ensures case-insensitivity and partial matching as requested.
    *   **`HAS(sale_records) == 1`**: This ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one associated sale record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_cars = Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`HAS(sale_records) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider cars that have at least one sales record, meaning they have been sold.
3.  **`inventory_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`**: For each car, this accesses its `inventory_snapshots`, ranks them by `snapshot_date` in descending order (`DESC`), assigning rank 1 to the latest snapshot (`per=""Cars""` ensures ranking is done independently for each car). The `WHERE` clause keeps only the latest snapshot (rank 1).
4.  **`.SINGULAR().is_in_inventory == False`**: Since the ranking filter guarantees only one snapshot per car, `SINGULAR()` is used to treat it as a single record. We then check if the `is_in_inventory` field for this latest snapshot is `False`.

3.  **`& (HAS(sale_records) == 1)`**: This ensures that we only consider cars that have at least one associated sale record in the `sale_records` sub-collection, allowing us to calculate a meaningful average sale price.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select the desired fields.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Range:** We first calculate the `start_date` (6 months before the start of the current month) and `end_date` (the start of the current month) using `DATETIME` functions.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data:** We access the `Sales` collection and filter it to include only sales falling within the `start_date` (inclusive) and `end_date` (exclusive). We then use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Truncate the `sale_date` to the start of the month (`sale_month`).
    *   Extract the `YEAR` from the associated salesperson's `hire_date`.
    *   Keep the `sale_price` for later aggregation.
3.  **Partition by Month:** The prepared `sales_info` is partitioned by `sale_month`. This groups all sales data from the specified period by the month they occurred in. This step ensures that all months within the 6-month range are represented in the output, even if no sales occurred in a particular month (or no sales by the target salespersons).
4.  **Calculate Metrics per Month:** We apply a `CALCULATE` operation on the partitioned data (`monthly_sales_partition`). For each month partition:
    *   We select the `sale_month` as `month`.
    *   We calculate `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales Count) by counting the `Sales` records *within that month's partition* where the `salesperson_hire_year` is between 2022 and 2023.
    *   We calculate `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) by summing the `sale_price` of `Sales` records *within that month's partition* where the `salesperson_hire_year` is between 2022 and 2023. If a month has sales, but none from salespersons hired in 2022-2023, these aggregations will correctly return 0.

**Explanation:**

1.  We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need a single average value across all payments.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to define the final output field `avg_days_to_payment`.
3.  Inside `CALCULATE`, we use the `AVG` aggregation function to compute the average.
4.  `AVG` operates on the results of an inner calculation performed on the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
5.  For each record in `PaymentsReceived`, we use an inner `CALCULATE` to compute `days_diff`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF` function with `""days""` as the unit, comparing the `payment_date` of the payment record with the `sale_date` from its linked `sale_record`.
6.  `.days_diff` accesses the result of this inner calculation for the `AVG` function.
7.  Finally, the `ROUND` function takes the calculated average and rounds it to 2 decimal places as requested.",15.86061406,"# Calculate the average number of days between the sale date and the payment received date, rounded to 2 decimal places.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
2.  **`gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This starts a calculation at the top `Dealership` level to compute aggregate values.
    *   **`total_revenue_2023=SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`**: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales that occurred in 2023.
    *   **`total_cost_2023=SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`**: Calculates the sum of the `cost` for all cars associated with the sales that occurred in 2023. It accesses the cost through the `car` relationship from the filtered sales.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This subsequent `CALCULATE` uses the previously computed totals to calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM).
    *   **`gpm_2023 = IFF(...)`**: The `IFF` function is used to apply the GPM formula `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.0`.
    *   **`total_cost_2023 != 0`**: This condition checks if the `total_cost_2023` is not zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   **`(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`**: If the cost is not zero, this calculates the GPM percentage. Using `100.0` ensures the result is a float.
    *   **`None`**: If the `total_cost_2023` is zero, the GPM is set to `None`.
4.  **`result = gpm_calculation.CALCULATE(gpm_2023=gpm_2023)`**: This final step selects only the calculated `gpm_2023` value and assigns it to the `result` variable.",17.59062004,"# Filter sales for the year 2023

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it based on a condition.
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each `Sale`, it checks if the associated `car` has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) `inventory_snapshots` record that meets the inner `WHERE` criteria.
3.  **`inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))`**: This inner filter selects inventory snapshots for the specific car where `is_in_inventory` is `False` (meaning it left inventory) *and* the `snapshot_date` of that inventory record is exactly the same as the `sale_date` of the current `Sale` being evaluated.
4.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`**: After filtering the sales to only include those where the car was sold on the same day it was marked out of inventory, this selects the single (`1`) sale record with the highest (`DESC()`) `sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payments_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step accesses the `PaymentsReceived` collection and prepares the data.
    *   It creates a `year_month_str` field by combining the year and month (padded with a leading zero if needed) from the `payment_date`. This creates a string like ""YYYY-MM"" which is essential for correct chronological sorting and grouping.
    *   It renames `payment_amount` to `payment_val` for use in the next step.
2.  **`monthly_grouped_payments = payments_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This step groups the prepared payment data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=(year_month_str))` groups the records based on the unique `year_month_str` values.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then operates on each group:
        *   `month_id=year_month_str` selects the identifier for the group.
        *   `total_monthly_payments=SUM(payments_info.payment_val)` calculates the sum of all `payment_val` within that specific month's group.
3.  **`result = monthly_grouped_payments.ORDER_BY(...).CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step calculates the MoM change.
    *   `ORDER_BY(month_id.ASC())` sorts the aggregated monthly totals chronologically based on the ""YYYY-MM"" string. This is crucial for the `PREV` function to correctly identify the *previous* month.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the final output fields:
        *   `year_month=month_id` presents the month identifier.
        *   `total_payments=total_monthly_payments` includes the calculated total for the month.
        *   `mom_change=total_monthly_payments - PREV(...)` calculates the Month-over-Month change.
            *   `PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=month_id.ASC(), default=0.0)` retrieves the `total_monthly_payments` value from the immediately preceding row in the sorted data.
            *   The `by=month_id.ASC()` argument reinforces the order used for finding the previous record (though `ORDER_BY` already sorted it).
            *   `default=0.0` ensures that for the very first month in the dataset (which has no preceding month), the previous value is treated as 0, so the MoM change is simply the total payment for that first month.

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made)==1)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those who have made at least one sale (`sales_made` sub-collection is not empty). This prevents potential division by zero errors when calculating ASP.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start with the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection. The `HASNOT(sale_records)` function checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to `Sales`) is empty for each car. We keep only those cars where this condition is true (i.e., they have no associated sales records).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and renames the required fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) for the cars that passed the filter. We rename `_id` to `car_id`, `make` to `car_make`, `model` to `car_model`, and `year` to `car_year` for clarity.",8.892856598,"cars_without_sales = Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cash_payments = PaymentsReceived.WHERE(payment_method == 'cash')`**: This line filters the `PaymentsReceived` collection to find all records where the `payment_method` field is exactly 'cash'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and filter it to include only those who have made at least one sale within the last 30 days.
    *   **`HAS(sales_made.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: Checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection (representing sales linked to the salesperson) is not empty after filtering for recent sales.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30`**: This condition filters the `sales_made` to include only sales where the difference between the `sale_date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`) is 30 days or less.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered salespersons, we calculate the required information:
    *   **`s_first_name=first_name`, `s_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the first and last names, renaming them to avoid conflicts.
    *   **`total_sales_count=COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of sales records within the `sales_made` sub-collection that satisfy the 30-day filter.
    *   **`total_revenue_amount=SUM(...)`**: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales records within the `sales_made` sub-collection that satisfy the 30-day filter.

2.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to compute new fields for each salesperson.
3.  **`rep_first_name=first_name, rep_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them for clarity.
4.  **`total_revenue=SUM(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago).sale_price)`**:
    *   Accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson.
    *   Filters these sales using `WHERE` to include only those where the `sale_date` is greater than or equal to `start_date_3_months_ago`.
    *   Calculates the `SUM` of the `sale_price` for these filtered sales, representing the total revenue for the period.
5.  **`total_sales_count=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(sale_date >= start_date_3_months_ago))`**:
    *   Similarly, accesses and filters `sales_made` based on the `sale_date`.
    *   Counts the number of sales (`COUNT`) within the specified 3-month period.
6.  **`.WHERE(total_sales_count > 0)`**: This filters the results to ensure that only salespersons who actually made sales during the last 3 months are considered for the ranking.
7.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue.DESC())`**: Selects the top 3 salespersons based on the calculated `total_revenue`, ordering them in descending order (highest revenue first).",26.64365959,"# Calculate the start date for the 3-month period (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(termination_date != None)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field is not null, ensuring we only consider salespersons who have actually been terminated.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates new fields for the filtered salespersons:
    *   `full_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates a full name by combining the `first_name` and `last_name` fields with a space in between.
    *   `phone_number=phone`: Selects the `phone` field and renames it to `phone_number`.
    *   `employment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the difference between the `termination_date` and `hire_date` in days using the `DATEDIFF` function and assigns it to the `employment_duration_days` field.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_duration_days.ASC())`**: This selects the top 1 record from the results of the `CALCULATE` step, ordered by the `employment_duration_days` in ascending order (`ASC()`). This effectively finds the salesperson with the shortest employment duration.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`weekend_utility_payments = PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts with the `PaymentsMade` collection and filters it based on two conditions combined with `&` (AND):

    *   `ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Selects payments where the day name of the `payment_date` is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". `DAYNAME()` extracts the day name from the date, and `ISIN()` checks if it's in the provided list.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the final result at the top `Dealership` level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates of the previous ISO week using the `DATETIME` function relative to the current moment (`'now'`). `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` finds the Monday of the previous week, and `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` finds the Sunday of the previous week.
2.  **`payments_last_week = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_info` context (which contains the calculated dates) and filter the records where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated `prev_week_start` and `prev_week_end`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered payments, we calculate `payment_day` by truncating `payment_date` to the start of the day using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`. We also select `payment_method` and `payment_amount` to be used in the next step.
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""day_method_groups"", by=(payment_day, payment_method))`**: We partition the `payments_last_week` data into groups based on the unique combinations of `payment_day` and `payment_method`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition, we calculate the final output:
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the date (from the partition key).
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method (from the partition key).
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(payments_last_week.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to that specific day and payment method group, referencing the amounts carried forward in the `payments_last_week` collection.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale record, it calculates:
    *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state from the associated `customer` record.
    *   `quarter_start_date=IFF(...)`: Determines the first day of the quarter ('YYYY-MM-DD' format) based on the month of the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions to check the month range (1-3 for Q1, 4-6 for Q2, 7-9 for Q3, 10-12 for Q4) and assigns the corresponding start date string for 2023.
    *   `sale_amount=sale_price`: Selects the `sale_price` to be used in the subsequent aggregation.
3.  **`result = sales_info_2023.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the prepared `sales_info_2023` data and partitions it.
    *   `name=""state_quarter_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(cust_state, quarter_start_date)`: Specifies that the data should be grouped based on unique combinations of the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatment_ddd_info = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection and filter it to include only treatments where:
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: The `end_dt` (end date) is not null, as required by the definition.
    *   `start_dt != end_dt`: The start and end dates are different, ensuring the treatment duration is not zero to prevent division by zero errors when calculating DDD.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered treatment, we calculate:
    *   `drug_name=drug.drug_name`: We retrieve the name of the drug associated with the treatment via the `drug` relationship. This is needed for grouping later.
    *   `ddd_per_treatment=(...)`: We calculate the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for this specific treatment according to the provided formula: `tot_drug_amt` divided by the treatment duration in days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`).
3.  **`drug_groups = treatment_ddd_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `treatment_ddd_info` collection.
    *   `name=""drug_group""`: We name the partitions (groups) ""drug\_group"".
    *   `by=(drug_name)`: We group the treatments based on their `drug_name`. All treatments for the same drug will be in the same partition.
4.  **`avg_ddd_per_drug = drug_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform calculations on each partition (each drug group).
    *   `drug_name=drug_name`: We select the `drug_name` (which is the partition key).
    *   `avg_ddd=AVG(Treatments.ddd_per_treatment)`: We calculate the average DDD for the drug. `AVG()` operates on the `ddd_per_treatment` values calculated earlier for all treatments belonging to the current partition (drug group). We access these values through `Treatments.ddd_per_treatment` because the `PARTITION` context allows accessing the original collection's data within the group.
5.  **`result = avg_ddd_per_drug`**: The final result, containing the drug name and its corresponding average DDD, is assigned to the `result` variable.",29.79942298,"# Calculate DDD for each relevant treatment first

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the `DermTreatment` high-level collection. `current_month_start` is the first day of the current month, and `prev_month_3_start` is the first day of the month three months prior to the current month.
2.  **`treatments_in_period`**: We access the `Treatments` collection via `date_boundaries` (to use the calculated dates). We filter treatments using `WHERE` to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the desired range (from `prev_month_3_start` up to, but not including, `current_month_start`). We then use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Create a `treatment_month` string in 'YYYY-MM' format.
    *   Extract the `patient_id` as `patient_key` for later distinct counting.
    *   Extract the `drug_type` as `treatment_drug_type` for filtering biologics.
3.  **`monthly_patient_counts`**: We partition the `treatments_in_period` collection by the calculated `treatment_month`. Within each partition (each month):
    *   We use `CALCULATE` to output the `month`.
    *   `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)` counts the unique patient IDs among all treatments within that month's partition.
    *   `NDISTINCT(Treatments.WHERE(treatment_drug_type == 'biologic').patient_key)` first filters the treatments within the partition to only include those where the `treatment_drug_type` is 'biologic', and *then* counts the unique patient IDs associated with those filtered biologic treatments.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we need a single aggregated count.
2.  **`num_patients=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_patients` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` function, which will count the number of records in the collection passed to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `treatments_received`: For each patient, we look at their list of received treatments.
    *   `.WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments based on the conditions inside.
    *   `(diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris')`: Checks if the diagnosis linked to the treatment has the name 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Doctors.PARTITION(name=""spec_group"", by=(speciality))`**: This groups the `Doctors` collection into partitions based on their `speciality`. Each partition (`spec_group`) contains all doctors belonging to a specific specialty.
2.  **`.Doctors`**: After partitioning, we access the doctors *within* each `spec_group`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first one)**: For each doctor within a specialty group, we calculate:
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `speciality=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty (available because it's the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: Calculates the count of unique drugs prescribed by navigating through the doctor's `prescribed_treatments` to the associated `drug` and counting the distinct `drug_id`s.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second one)**: This takes the results from the previous step and calculates the final rank:
    *   It selects `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs` again.
    *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC(), per=""spec_group"")`: This calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor.
        *   `by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be based on the `num_distinct_drugs` calculated earlier, in descending order (higher count gets rank 1).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: Defines the time window. It calculates the first day of the current month (`start_of_current_month`) and the first day of the month 12 months prior (`start_date_12_months_ago`).
2.  **`treatments_filtered = date_info.Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `Treatments` collection via `date_info` (to use the calculated dates) and filters them to include only those whose `start_dt` falls within the desired 12-month period (greater than or equal to `start_date_12_months_ago` and less than `start_of_current_month`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered treatments, it calculates:
    *   `treatment_month`: Extracts the year and month from `start_dt` and formats it as ""YYYY-MM"" using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent sorting.
    *   `patient_identifier`: Retrieves the `patient_id` from the related `patient` record, which is needed for the distinct patient count (PMPD).
4.  **`.PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", by=treatment_month)`**: Groups the `treatments_filtered` data by the calculated `treatment_month`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each monthly group created by the partition:
    *   `month = treatment_month`: Selects the month identifier.
    *   `PMPD = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_identifier)`: Calculates the Per Month Patient Diagnoses by counting the number of unique `patient_identifier` values within that month's treatments.
    *   `PMTC = COUNT(Treatments)`: Calculates the Per Month Treatment Count by counting the total number of treatments within that month's group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_info`**: This variable calculates the year each patient received their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)` filters out patients who have never received any treatment.
    *   `CALCULATE` computes `first_treatment_year` by finding the minimum (`MIN`) `start_dt` among all `treatments_received` for each patient and extracting the `YEAR` from that date. It also keeps `patient_id` for counting purposes later.
2.  **`yearly_new_patients_count`**: This variable groups the patients by their first treatment year and counts them.
    *   It takes the `patient_first_treatment_info` collection as input.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year)` groups the records based on the `first_treatment_year`.
    *   `CALCULATE` then computes:
        *   `year`: The first treatment year for the group.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count (`COUNT`) of patients within each year's partition group, representing the number of new patients for that year. We count the records from the input collection (`patient_first_treatment_info`) that fall into this partition.
    *   `ORDER_BY(year.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically, which is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly in the next step.
3.  **`npi_result`**: This final variable calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI).
    *   It takes the sorted `yearly_new_patients_count` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` computes:
        *   `year`: The year.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients for that year.
        *   `npi`: The New Patient Increase. This is calculated by subtracting the number of new patients from the previous year (`PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's `num_new_patients`. `PREV` looks back one record based on the ascending order of `year`. `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the dataset, the NPI is calculated as `num_new_patients - 0`.",26.09315205,"# Step 1: Find the year of the first treatment for each patient

**Explanation:**

1.  **`drug_ae_counts = Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection and calculate new fields for each drug.
2.  **`d_id=drug_id, d_name=drug_name`**: We temporarily store `drug_id` and `drug_name` in new variables (`d_id`, `d_name`) to avoid naming conflicts in the final output step.
3.  **`num_relevant_aes=SUM(...)`**: This calculates the total count of relevant adverse events for the current drug.
4.  **`treatments_used_in.adverse_events.CALCULATE(...)`**: We navigate from the drug to its associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`) and then to the adverse events (`adverse_events`) linked to those treatments. Inside this nested `CALCULATE`, we evaluate each adverse event individually.
5.  **`is_same_month_event=IFF(...)`**: For each adverse event, we use the `IFF` function to check the condition:
    *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == YEAR(treatment.start_dt)) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == MONTH(treatment.start_dt))`: This checks if the year and month of the adverse event's `reported_dt` are the same as the year and month of the corresponding treatment's `start_dt`.
    *   If the condition is true, `IFF` returns `1`; otherwise, it returns `0`.
6.  **`).is_same_month_event`**: After the nested `CALCULATE`, we access the `is_same_month_event` result (which is 1 or 0).
7.  **`SUM(...)`**: The `SUM` function aggregates these 1s and 0s across all adverse events associated with the current drug via its treatments, effectively counting only those events that meet the same-month condition.
8.  **`top_drug_by_ae = drug_ae_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_relevant_aes.DESC())`**: We take the results from the previous step (`drug_ae_counts`) and use `TOP_K(1)` to select the single drug (`k=1`) that has the highest `num_relevant_aes` count. `.DESC()` ensures we get the highest value.
9.  **`result = top_drug_by_ae.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select the required fields from the top drug record, renaming `d_id` back to `drug_id`, `d_name` to `drug_name`, and `num_relevant_aes` to `num_adverse_events` for the final output.",32.46162915,"# Calculate the count of relevant adverse events for each drug

**Explanation:**

1.  `Doctors.WHERE(...)`: We start with the `Doctors` collection and filter it.
2.  `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1`: This is the filter condition. It checks if a doctor `HAS` at least one (`== 1`) record in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause.
3.  `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')`: This inner filter selects only those treatments (`prescribed_treatments`) where the associated `drug` has a `drug_type` equal to 'Biologic'.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`treatments_with_details = treatments_2022.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step takes the filtered treatments and calculates two new fields necessary for the next steps:
    *   `ins_type = patient.ins_type`: Retrieves the insurance type from the related `patient` record for each treatment.
    *   `patient_id = patient.patient_id`: Retrieves the patient ID, which will be used later to count distinct patients.
3.  **`partitioned_by_insurance = treatments_with_details.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the intermediate results (`treatments_with_details`) into groups based on the `ins_type` field calculated previously. Each group (`insurance_groups`) contains all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.
4.  **`insurance_stats = partitioned_by_insurance.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on each partition (each insurance type group) created in the previous step:
    *   `insurance_type = ins_type`: Selects the insurance type (the partition key).
    *   `avg_pasi_day100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average `day100_pasi_score` by accessing the `outcome_records` associated with the treatments within the current insurance type group. The `AVG` function handles the aggregation across potentially multiple outcome records per treatment and multiple treatments per group.
    *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id` values within the current insurance type group, giving the distinct patient count for that insurance type.

        )
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the count).
2.  **`num_qualifying_treatments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a field `num_qualifying_treatments` and assign it the count of treatments that meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Treatments` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition filters treatments based on their associated diagnosis.
    *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment.
    *   `LOWER(...)`: Converts the diagnosis name to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%psoriasis%')`: Checks if the lowercase diagnosis name contains the substring 'psoriasis'. The `%` acts as a wildcard.
5.  **`(drug.fda_appr_dt != None)`**: This condition filters treatments based on their associated drug. It checks if the `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date) field for the linked drug is not null, implying the drug has been FDA-approved.
6.  **`(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This condition filters treatments based on their end date (`end_dt`).
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`: Calculates the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `DATETIME('now')`: Gets the current date and time.
    *   The combined condition ensures that the treatment's `end_dt` falls within the range from 6 months ago up to and including the current moment.
7.  **`&`**: The logical AND operator combines all three conditions, meaning a treatment must satisfy all of them to be included in the count.
8.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Finally, `COUNT` counts the number of `Treatments` records that remain after applying all the filters.",23.02415967,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`target_reg_year_calc = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(target_year = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2)`**: Calculates the target registration year by subtracting 2 from the current year obtained using `YEAR(DATETIME('now'))`. This value is stored in the `target_year` variable within the `target_reg_year_calc` context.
2.  **`doctors_filtered = target_reg_year_calc.Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `Doctors` collection through the context containing the `target_year`. It filters doctors based on two conditions:
    *   `year_reg == target_year`: Selects doctors whose registration year matches the calculated target year.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`: Ensures that only doctors who have prescribed at least one treatment are included.
3.  **`first_treatment_for_doctor = doctors_filtered.prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`**: Navigates to the `prescribed_treatments` for the filtered doctors. It then filters these treatments using:
    *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1`: Ranks the treatments for *each doctor* (`per=""Doctors""`) based on their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `WHERE` clause selects only the treatment with rank 1 (the earliest one).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since the ranking filter guarantees only one treatment (the first) per doctor, `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record, allowing its fields to be accessed directly in the final `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`result = doctors_filtered.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects the final output fields from the `doctors_filtered` collection:
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Retrieves the doctor's last name.
    *   `registration_year=year_reg`: Retrieves the doctor's registration year.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents`**: We begin by accessing the `AdverseEvents` collection, as the primary focus is on the adverse events themselves.
2.  **`WHERE(...)`**: We filter these events based on their timing relative to the associated treatment's start date.
    *   **`treatment.start_dt`**: We access the `start_dt` field from the related `Treatments` record using the `treatment` relationship.
    *   **`reported_dt`**: This is the date the adverse event was reported, directly available in the `AdverseEvents` collection.
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)`**: This function calculates the number of full days between the treatment start date and the adverse event reported date.
    *   **`(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: This combined condition selects events where the reported date is on or after the treatment start date, but no more than 10 days later.
3.  **`CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered adverse events, we select and rename the required fields:

**Explanation:**

1.  **`qualifying_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Treatments` collection and applies filters:
    *   `is_placebo == True`: Filters for treatments that are placebos.
    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds) == 1`: Ensures the treatment has at least one associated concomitant medication record.
    *   `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Treatments.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)) == 1`: This is the core condition. It checks if there exists (`HAS(...) == 1`) at least one record within the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection where the difference in days (`DATEDIFF(""days"", ...)` ) between the treatment's start date (`Treatments.start_dt`) and the concomitant med's start date (`start_dt`) is less than or equal to 14 days (2 weeks).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want to compute a single aggregate value (the average age) across a subset of patients.
2.  **`average_age=AVG(...)`**: We define the output field `average_age` using the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside `AVG`, we target the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: The filter condition selects only patients whose `gender` is 'Male' AND whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`**: For each patient passing the filter, we calculate their current age in full years using `DATEDIFF`. We compare their `date_of_birth` with the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) and specify ""years"" as the unit. This calculated age is stored temporarily as `age_in_years`.
6.  **`.age_in_years`**: We access the `age_in_years` value calculated in the previous step. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `age_in_years` values from all the filtered male patients with private insurance. `DATEDIFF` with ""years"" naturally provides the integer age.",19.65838242,"# Calculate the average age for male patients with private insurance

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it to include only those merchants who have at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) received transaction (`transactions_received`) that is marked as 'completed' (`WHERE(status == 'completed')`). This pre-filtering prevents potential division-by-zero errors later if a merchant has no successful transactions.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered merchants, we calculate the required output fields.
3.  **`merchant_name=name`**: We select the merchant's name.
4.  **`cpur = NDISTINCT(...) / NDISTINCT(...)`**: We calculate the CPUR according to the definition:
    *   **`NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').coupon_id)`**: This counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s associated with the merchant's successful received transactions.
    *   **`NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').txid)`**: This counts the number of unique successful received transactions (using `txid` as the unique identifier for a transaction).

).ORDER_BY(week_start_date.ASC()) # Order the results by week
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Period:** We first define the `start_period` (start of the week 3 weeks ago) and `end_period` (start of the current week) using the `DATETIME` function with relative offsets ('-3 weeks') and truncation ('start of week').
2.  **Filter Notifications:** We start with the `Notifications` collection and apply filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `created_at >= start_period`: Ensures notifications are from the beginning of the 3-week period or later.
    *   `created_at < end_period`: Ensures notifications are before the start of the current week.
    *   `ISIN(user.country, (""US"", ""Canada""))`: Filters for notifications sent to users whose `country` is either ""US"" or ""Canada"".
3.  **Calculate Week Start:** In the same step, we use `CALCULATE` to create a new field `notification_week_start` by truncating the `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`. This field will be used for grouping.
4.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` on the filtered `notification_info` collection.
    *   `name=""weekly_notifications""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(notification_week_start)`: Groups the notifications based on the calculated `notification_week_start` date.
5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts:** After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` on the resulting groups:
    *   `week_start_date = notification_week_start`: Selects the grouping key (the start date of the week).
    *   `total_notifications = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications belonging to the current week's partition group.
    *   `weekend_notifications = COUNT(KEEP_IF(Notifications, ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`: Counts only the notifications within the group whose `created_at` falls on a Saturday or Sunday. `DAYNAME` extracts the day name, `ISIN` checks if it's Saturday or Sunday, and `KEEP_IF` returns the notification record only if the condition is true, which `COUNT` then counts.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection and filters it based on multiple conditions combined with the logical AND operator (`&`).
    *   **`sending_user.country == ""US""`**: It filters transactions where the `country` of the `sending_user` (accessed via the relationship) is ""US"".
    *   **`transaction_type == ""wallet""`**: It further filters for transactions where the `transaction_type` field is exactly ""wallet"".
    *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 6`**: This condition filters transactions based on their creation date (`created_at`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now')` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's creation date and the current moment ('now'). By checking if this difference is less than or equal to 6, we include transactions from today (0 days difference) and the previous 6 days, effectively covering the ""last 7 days inclusive"".

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, 'now') <= 7)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days (inclusive) from the current time ('now'). `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, 'now')` calculates the difference in days between the update time and now.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to define the output fields for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`) and name it `user_id`.
3.  **`latest_user_balance=...`**: This calculates the LUB for each user.
4.  **`balances.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user.
5.  **`RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function:
    *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: Ranks the balance records based on the `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (latest first).
    *   `per=""Users""`: Ensures the ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
    *   `== 1`: Filters to keep only the balance record with rank 1 (the most recent one).
6.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause with `RANKING(...) == 1` guarantees that at most one balance record remains for each user, `.SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record, allowing access to its fields.
7.  **`.balance`**: We access the `balance` field from the singular, most recent balance record identified.
8.  **`DEFAULT_TO(..., None)`**: This function wraps the balance retrieval. If a user has no balance records (`balances` is empty), the `WHERE` clause will yield nothing, `.SINGULAR()` will result in null, and accessing `.balance` would normally fail. `DEFAULT_TO` catches this and returns `None` instead, ensuring the query doesn't error for users without balances.",25.46655679,"# Calculate the Latest User Balance (LUB) for each user.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`latest_snapshot = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing all `UserSettingSnapshots`.
2.  **`RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`**: Inside the `WHERE` clause, we use the `RANKING` window function.
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: This orders the snapshots for each user by their `snapshot_date` in descending order (latest first).
    *   `per=""Users""`: This ensures the ranking is done independently for each user (partitioned by user).
    *   `== 1`: We filter to keep only the snapshot ranked as #1 (the latest one) for each user.
3.  **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the ranking filter ensures we have at most one snapshot per user, we use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this result as a single record within the context of each user. This allows direct access to its fields in the subsequent `CALCULATE`.
4.  **`user_marketing_preferences = Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We then go back to the `Users` collection.
5.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's ID (`uid`).
6.  **`marketing_preference=latest_snapshot.marketing_opt_in`**: We access the `marketing_opt_in` field from the `latest_snapshot` variable we defined earlier. Because `latest_snapshot` was made singular relative to each user, we can directly access its `marketing_opt_in` field.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. For each merchant, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name`: Takes the `name` field.
    *   `merchant_category`: Takes the `category` field.
    *   `total_revenue`: This calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with the merchant via the `transactions_received` relationship. We apply a `WHERE` clause *within* the `SUM` aggregation to filter these transactions, including only those where the `status` is `'completed'`, as required by the definition of MRR (based on successfully received transactions).
2.  **`mrr_results = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: We take the results from the previous step (`merchant_revenues`) and apply another `CALCULATE`:
    *   We select the `merchant_name` and `merchant_category` calculated previously.
    *   We rename `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` as requested in the output description.
    *   We calculate `revenue_rank` using the `RANKING()` window function. The ranking is performed `by` the `total_revenue` in descending order (`.DESC()`), ensuring that the merchant with the highest revenue receives rank 1.
3.  **`.ORDER_BY(revenue_rank.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are ordered by the calculated `revenue_rank` in ascending order, presenting the top-ranked merchants first. This step is optional but helpful for reviewing the results.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Calculation:** We first define `start_date` and `end_date` using the `DATETIME` function to precisely capture the last two full calendar months, excluding the current month. `start_date` is set to the beginning of the month two months ago, and `end_date` is set to the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Transaction Filtering:** We start with the `Transactions` collection and apply filters:
    *   `sender_type == 0`: Selects only transactions initiated by users.
    *   `created_at >= start_date & created_at < end_date`: Filters transactions to fall within the desired two-month period.
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to extract the specific day (`transaction_day`), month (`transaction_month`), and the `sender_id` for each relevant transaction.
3.  **Daily Active Users (DAU) Calculation:**
    *   We partition the `filtered_transactions` by both `transaction_month` and `transaction_day` using `PARTITION(name=""daily_groups"", ...)`. This groups transactions by each specific day within the two-month period.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` following the partition, we calculate `dau_count = NDISTINCT(Transactions.user_id)`. This counts the number of unique users (`sender_id`) who made at least one transaction on that specific `day` within that `month`.
4.  **Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) Calculation:**
    *   We take the `daily_active_users` results (which contain daily unique user counts) and partition them again, this time only by `month` using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_groups"", ...)`.
    *   In the final `CALCULATE`, we compute `pmdau = AVG(daily_groups.dau_count)`. This calculates the average of the daily active user counts (`dau_count`) for each `month`, giving us the PMDAU. The `daily_groups` refers back to the collection created by the previous partition step.
5.  **Ordering:** Finally, `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically by month.",29.00885606,"# Define the start and end dates for the last two full months

        *   `user_sessions_group.CALCULATE(...)`: This inner `CALCULATE` runs on each session *within* the current user's group.
        *   `session_duration=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the duration of a single session in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.session_duration`: Selects the calculated duration for the `SUM` function.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the `Ewallet` top-level collection.
    *   `start_of_current_month`: Determines the beginning of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_of_previous_month`: Calculates the beginning of the previous month by subtracting one month from the `start_of_current_month`.
2.  **`transactions_previous_month`**: We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those records where the `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to `start_of_previous_month` and less than `start_of_current_month`).
3.  **`transaction_stats`**: We calculate two aggregate values based on the filtered transactions:
    *   `total_transactions_prev_month`: The total count of transactions in the previous month.
    *   `successful_transactions_prev_month`: The count of transactions within the previous month where the `status` is 'completed'.
4.  **`result`**: Finally, we calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR).
    *   We use the `IFF` function to check if `total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
    *   If there were transactions, we calculate STR by dividing `successful_transactions_prev_month` by `total_transactions_prev_month`. We multiply by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division.
    *   If there were no transactions (`total_transactions_prev_month` is 0), STR is set to `0.0`.
    *   The final result contains a single field `previous_month_str` representing the calculated rate.",24.45348072,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the previous month

result = merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_same_month_coupons.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to process each merchant individually and compute new fields:
    *   `merchant_mid`: Stores the merchant's ID (`mid`).
    *   `merchant_name`: Stores the merchant's name (`name`).
    *   `num_same_month_coupons`: This calculates the count of coupons for the current merchant. It accesses the `coupons` sub-collection and applies a `WHERE` filter. The filter keeps only those coupons where the coupon's creation year (`YEAR(coupons.created_at)`) and month (`MONTH(coupons.created_at)`) are the same as the merchant's creation year (`YEAR(created_at)`) and month (`MONTH(created_at)`). The `created_at` without `coupons.` refers to the `created_at` field of the `Merchants` collection in this context. `COUNT` then counts how many coupons passed the filter for that specific merchant.
3.  Finally, `TOP_K(1, by=num_same_month_coupons.DESC())` is applied to the collection generated by `CALCULATE`. This selects the single merchant (`1`) who has the highest (`DESC()`) value for our calculated `num_same_month_coupons` field.
4.  The final result, containing the `merchant_mid`, `merchant_name`, and `num_same_month_coupons` for the top merchant, is assigned to the `result` variable.",26.60687232,"# Calculate the number of coupons created in the same month/year as the merchant for each merchant

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: Starts by accessing the `Users` collection and filtering it based on specific criteria.
2.  **`(LOWER(country) == 'us')`**: Filters users whose `country` field, when converted to lowercase, is exactly 'us'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the country.
3.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is a crucial filter.
    *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for each user and filters these notifications.
    *   `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`: The inner filter keeps only notifications that are of type 'promotional' AND have a status of 'unread'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the user has *at least one* notification that matches the inner filter criteria (unread and promotional). Only users who meet this condition, along with the country condition, are kept.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who passed the `WHERE` clause filters:
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username` field and assigns it to the new field `user_name`.
    *   `total_unread_promotional_notifications=COUNT(...)`: Calculates the total count of unread promotional notifications for each selected user.
        *   `COUNT(notifications.WHERE(...))`: Counts the number of notifications within the user's `notifications` sub-collection that satisfy the condition `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This step filters the `Transactions` collection based on multiple criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Selects transactions only from the year 2023.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successfully completed transactions.
    *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Ensures the sender was a user, excluding merchants.
    *   `sending_user.status == ""active""`: Filters for transactions where the associated sending user has an 'active' status.
2.  **`transaction_info`**: This step calculates two new fields for the filtered transactions:
    *   `transaction_month_date`: Extracts the date corresponding to the start of the month from the transaction's `created_at` timestamp using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `sending_user_id`: Retrieves the unique identifier (`uid`) of the sending user, which is needed for counting distinct users later.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: This step partitions the `transaction_info` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_transactions"", by=(transaction_month_date))`: Groups the transactions based on the `transaction_month_date` calculated previously. All transactions from the same month will be in the same group.
4.  **`monthly_active_user_counts`**: This step calculates the final result for each monthly group:
    *   `month_start_date=transaction_month_date`: Selects the month date (which is the partition key).
    *   `distinct_active_users_count=NDISTINCT(monthly_transactions.sending_user_id)`: Counts the number of unique `sending_user_id` values within each month's partition group (`monthly_transactions`). This gives the count of distinct active users who sent money in that specific month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transactions_info = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`**: This line starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `sender_type` is 0 (indicating the sender is a user). It then uses `CALCULATE` to create a temporary collection containing the sending user's country (`sender_country`), the sending user's unique ID (`sender_uid`), and the transaction amount (`tx_amount`) for each of these filtered transactions.
2.  **`country_groups = transactions_info.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(sender_country))`**: This partitions the `transactions_info` collection into groups based on the `sender_country`. Each partition (`country_group`) contains all the transaction information (country, user ID, amount) for a specific country.
3.  **`country_stats = country_groups.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line operates on the partitioned data. For each `country_group`, it calculates:
    *   `country`: The country name (which is the partition key `sender_country`).
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all `tx_amount` values within that specific country's partition (`country_group`).
    *   `distinct_user_count`: The count of unique `sender_uid` values within that country's partition, effectively counting the distinct users who sent transactions from that country.
4.  **`top_countries_by_amount = country_stats.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`**: Finally, this selects the top 5 rows from the `country_stats` collection, ordered by `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_merchant_transactions`**: This intermediate step defines the set of transactions we are interested in for each merchant. It accesses the `transactions_received` sub-collection for each merchant and applies two filters using `WHERE`:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150`: This filters transactions created within the last 150 days (inclusive) relative to the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: This filters transactions where the `receiver_type` field is exactly 1, as specified in the request.
2.  **`merchant_totals`**: This step calculates the required aggregates for each merchant that has relevant transactions.
    *   It starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `WHERE(HAS(recent_merchant_transactions) == 1)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection to include only those merchants who have at least one transaction matching the criteria defined in `recent_merchant_transactions`.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: This calculates the required output fields for each qualifying merchant:
        *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
        *   `num_transactions=COUNT(recent_merchant_transactions)`: Counts the number of transactions identified in the `recent_merchant_transactions` step for the current merchant.
        *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(recent_merchant_transactions.amount)`: Sums the `amount` of the transactions identified in the `recent_merchant_transactions` step for the current merchant.
3.  **`top_2_merchants`**: This step selects the top 2 merchants from the `merchant_totals` collection.
    *   `TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the top 2 records, ordering them in descending order (`DESC()`) based on the `total_transaction_amount` calculated previously.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`earliest_info = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top `Ewallet` level to calculate a global value: the earliest snapshot date in 2023.
    *   **`MIN(UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023).snapshot_date)`**: This finds the minimum `snapshot_date` among all snapshots within the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection where the year of the `snapshot_date` is 2023.
    *   **`min_date_2023=...`**: The calculated minimum date is stored in the variable `min_date_2023`.
2.  **`result = earliest_info.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform another calculation at the `Ewallet` level, using the previously calculated `min_date_2023`.
    *   **`AVG(UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(snapshot_date == min_date_2023).tx_limit_daily)`**: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only those snapshots whose `snapshot_date` exactly matches the `min_date_2023` found earlier. It then calculates the average of the `tx_limit_daily` for these specific snapshots.
    *   **`AVG(UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(snapshot_date == min_date_2023).tx_limit_monthly)`**: Similarly, this calculates the average of the `tx_limit_monthly` for the snapshots matching the earliest date in 2023.
    *   **`avg_daily_limit=...`, `avg_monthly_limit=...`**: The calculated averages are assigned to the respective result fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`session_durations = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This first step accesses the `UserSessions` collection. For each session, it calculates the duration in seconds by finding the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` using the `DATEDIFF` function. It also keeps the `device_type` field, which is needed for grouping later. The result is stored in the `session_durations` variable.
2.  **`avg_duration_by_device = session_durations.PARTITION(...)`**: This step takes the `session_durations` collection and partitions it.
    *   `name=""device_groups""`: Assigns a temporary name to the groups created by the partition.
    *   `by=(device_type)`: Specifies that the sessions should be grouped based on their `device_type`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This is applied to the result of the partition. For each `device_type` group:
    *   `device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` for the current group.
    *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(UserSessions.duration_secs)`: Calculates the average (`AVG`) of the `duration_secs` (calculated in the first step) for all sessions belonging to the current `device_type` group. The `UserSessions.duration_secs` refers back to the `duration_secs` field calculated on the original `UserSessions` collection within the context of the current partition group.

        *   `coupons`: Accesses the coupons associated with the current merchant.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1`: Ranks the coupons for the current merchant (`per=""Merchants""`) based on their `start_date` in ascending order. The `WHERE(...) == 1` clause selects only the coupon with rank 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the result (which is guaranteed to be one coupon per merchant due to the ranking filter) into a singular record, allowing direct access to its fields like `cid` and `start_date`.
3.  **`filtered_merchants = merchant_earliest_coupon_info.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the results further based on the time condition.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: Starts by accessing the `Users` collection and applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`HAS(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 0`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `notifications`: Accesses the list of notifications associated with each user.
    *   `.WHERE(created_at < DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year'))`: Filters these notifications to find only those whose `created_at` timestamp is strictly less than one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp (signup date). The outer `created_at` refers to `Users.created_at`, and the inner `created_at` refers to `Notifications.created_at`. `DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')` calculates the date exactly one year after the user signed up.
    *   `HAS(...)`: Checks if *any* notification exists that satisfies the inner `WHERE` condition (i.e., was created within the first year).
    *   `== 0`: The filter keeps only those users for whom the `HAS` check returns `0` (false), meaning they have *no* notifications created within their first year.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who pass the filter, this selects and potentially renames the required fields:
    *   `user_name=username`: Selects the `username`.
    *   `user_email=email`: Selects the `email`.
    *   `signup_date=created_at`: Selects the user's `created_at` date (signup date).
4.  **`users_without_first_year_notification = ...`**: Assigns the resulting collection of users (with their username, email, and signup date) to the variable `users_without_first_year_notification`.",18.85922432,"import datetime
