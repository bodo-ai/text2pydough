**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`**: This selects customers who have made 5 or more transactions by counting the entries in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (first)**: For the filtered customers, this step calculates:
    *   `customer_name`: Renames the `name` field.
    *   `total_transactions`: Counts all transactions for the customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
    *   `successful_transactions`: Counts only the transactions where the `status` field is exactly 'Completed' using `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == 'Completed'))`.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` (second)**: This step takes the results from the previous calculation and computes:
    *   `success_rate`: Divides the `successful_transactions` by `total_transactions` and multiplies by `100.0` (using `100.0` ensures floating-point division) to get the percentage success rate. It also keeps the `customer_name`.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted based on the calculated `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).",18.93682241,"# Filter customers with at least 5 transactions and calculate counts

1.  **`faang_tickers = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`**: Defines a tuple containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG stocks for easier reference.
2.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: Starts the query at the top-level `Broker` collection and uses `CALCULATE` to compute a single aggregated result.
3.  **`distinct_faang_buyers_count=COUNT(...)`**: Defines the output field name and uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of customers that satisfy the conditions.
4.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: Accesses the `Customers` collection and applies filtering conditions using `WHERE`.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`**: Filters customers whose `email` field ends with "".com"".
6.  **`&`**: Combines the email filter with the transaction filter using a logical AND.
7.  **`HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1`**: This is the transaction filter:
    *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Filters these transactions, keeping only those where the associated `ticker`'s `symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` tuple using the `ISIN` function.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the customer has at least one transaction that passed the inner `WHERE` filter (i.e., if they bought at least one FAANG stock).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:**
    *   `start_of_current_week = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Determines the exact timestamp for the beginning of the current week based on the system's configuration (e.g., Sunday or Monday).
    *   `start_of_period = DATETIME(start_of_current_week, '-8 weeks')`: Calculates the timestamp exactly 8 weeks prior to the start of the current week. This marks the beginning of our analysis window.

2.  **Filter Transactions:**
    *   `relevant_transactions = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: Selects only the transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within our desired time frame: greater than or equal to the `start_of_period` and strictly less than the `start_of_current_week`. This effectively excludes the current week.

3.  **Calculate Week Info:**
    *   `transaction_info = relevant_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: Determines the starting date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This will be used for grouping.
        *   `is_weekend_flag = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: Checks if the transaction's day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"" and creates a boolean flag (`True` if it's a weekend, `False` otherwise).

4.  **Group by Week:**
    *   `weekly_groups = transaction_info.PARTITION(name=""weekly_data"", by=week_start)`: Groups the `transaction_info` records based on the unique `week_start` dates. All transactions from the same week will be placed into the same partition group, accessible via the name `weekly_data`.

5.  **Calculate Weekly Counts:**
    *   `weekly_summary = weekly_groups.CALCULATE(...)`: Operates on each partition group (each week).
        *   `week_starting = week_start`: Selects the week start date (the partition key).
        *   `total_transactions = COUNT(weekly_data.Transactions)`: Counts all transactions belonging to the current week's partition group.
        *   `weekend_transactions = COUNT(weekly_data.Transactions.WHERE(is_weekend_flag == True))`: Counts only those transactions within the current week's group where the previously calculated `is_weekend_flag` is `True`.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_starting.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the week's starting date.

6.  **Assign Result:**

    *   These calculated dates (`start_last_week`, `end_last_week`) are stored in the `date_boundaries` context.
2.  **`usa_transactions_last_week = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Selects transactions where the associated customer's country is ""USA"".

    *   The filtered transactions are assigned to `usa_transactions_last_week`.
3.  **`result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform the final aggregation at the top `Broker` level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_buy_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is exactly 'buy' and the `date_time` falls within the last 10 days (including the current day). `DATEDIFF(""days"", date_time, 'now') <= 9` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between the transaction date and now; a value of 0 means today, 1 means yesterday, up to 9 for 9 full days ago, covering a 10-day window.
2.  **`transaction_info`**: This takes the filtered transactions and calculates a new field `ticker_symbol` by accessing the `symbol` field from the related `ticker` record. This makes the symbol available for partitioning.
3.  **`ticker_counts`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection based on the `ticker_symbol`. For each unique symbol (each partition group), it calculates the `ticker_symbol` itself and the total count of transactions (`num_buy_transactions`) within that group using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
4.  **`top_2_frequent_tickers`**: This applies the `TOP_K` function to the `ticker_counts` collection. It selects the top 2 records ordered by `num_buy_transactions` in descending order, effectively giving the two ticker symbols with the most buy transactions in the specified period. The result contains the `ticker_symbol` and `num_buy_transactions` for these top 2 symbols.",30.55305934,"# Filter transactions to include only 'buy' types within the last 10 days (including today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: Calculates the necessary date boundaries: the first day of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the first day of the month six months prior (`six_months_ago_start`) using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  **`customers_in_period`**: Filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` falls between `six_months_ago_start` (inclusive) and `current_month_start` (exclusive). It also extracts the `signup_year` and `signup_month_num` from the `join_date`.
3.  **`customers_with_month_str`**: Creates a formatted string `signup_month_str` in 'YYYY-MM' format for easier grouping and display. `LPAD` ensures the month number is two digits (e.g., '06' instead of '6').
4.  **`monthly_customer_stats`**:
    *   Partitions the filtered customers using `PARTITION` based on the `signup_month_str`. This groups customers by the month they signed up.
    *   Uses `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data:
        *   Selects the `signup_month` (which is the partition key `signup_month_str`).
        *   Calculates `pmcs` (Per Month Customer Signups) by counting the `Customers` within each monthly partition group using `COUNT(Customers)`.
        *   Calculates `pmat` (Per Month Average Transaction Amount) by calculating the average `amount` from all `transactions_made` by the `Customers` within that specific signup month group using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`.
    *   Orders the final result chronologically using `ORDER_BY(signup_month.ASC())`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_prices_info = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `DailyPrices` collection. It then filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where the `date` is within the last 6 days relative to the current time (`'now'`), effectively capturing the last 7 days inclusive of today.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(ticker_type = ticker.ticker_type, close_price = close)`**: After filtering, this calculates two fields for each relevant price record:
    *   `ticker_type`: It retrieves the `ticker_type` by navigating from the `DailyPrices` record to its associated `ticker` record. This is needed for grouping later.
    *   `close_price`: It explicitly selects the `close` price, making it available for the subsequent aggregation step.
3.  **`partitioned_prices = recent_prices_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered and calculated data (`recent_prices_info`) and partitions it.
    *   `name=""type_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (optional but good practice).
    *   `by=(ticker_type)`: Specifies that the data should be grouped based on the unique values of the `ticker_type` field calculated previously.
4.  **`ticker_type_acp = partitioned_prices.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final step operates on each partition group created.
    *   `ticker_type = ticker_type`: Selects the `ticker_type` (which is the key for the current partition group).
    *   `ACP = AVG(DailyPrices.close)`: Calculates the Average Closing Price (ACP) for each group. `AVG(DailyPrices.close)` computes the average of the `close` field from the original `DailyPrices` records that belong to the current `ticker_type` partition group. The result is assigned to the `ACP` field.

The final variable `ticker_type_acp` will contain a collection where each record represents a unique `ticker_type` and its corresponding Average Closing Price (ACP) over the specified 7-day period.",24.32473302,"# Filter DailyPrices to include only records from the last 7 days (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`customers_2022_info`**: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is in the year 2022. It then calculates two fields for each of these customers: their `country` and a boolean `has_transactions` which is true if the customer has made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`).
2.  **`country_groups`**: This partitions the `customers_2022_info` collection based on the `country` field. Each partition (`countries`) represents a unique country containing customers who joined in 2022.
3.  **`country_metrics`**: This calculates metrics for each country partition.
    *   `country_name`: Retrieves the country name from the partition key.
    *   `total_customers_in_group`: Counts the total number of customers within that country's partition (all joined in 2022).
    *   `active_customers_in_group`: Sums the `has_transactions` boolean field for customers within the partition. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this effectively counts the customers who have transactions.
4.  **`country_activity_ratio` / `result`**: This calculates the final Activity Ratio (AR) for each country.
    *   `country`: Selects the country name.
    *   `AR`: Calculates the ratio using the formula `(active_customers_in_group / total_customers_in_group) * 100.0`. The `IFF` function is used to prevent division by zero errors by returning `0.0` if `total_customers_in_group` is zero for a specific country. Using `100.0` ensures floating-point division for the percentage calculation. The final result containing the country and its AR is assigned to the `result` variable.",25.72567677,"# Filter customers who joined in 2022 and determine if they have transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we need a final aggregated count. `CALCULATE` is used to compute this single value.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to keep only records where the `transaction_type` is 'sell' and the `date_time` is within the last month (greater than or equal to exactly one month ago from the current time).
2.  **`ticker_groups`**: This partitions the `filtered_transactions` based on the `ticker.symbol`. Each partition (`ticker_sales`) will contain all the filtered 'sell' transactions for a specific ticker symbol.
3.  **`ticker_aggregates`**: This calculates aggregates for each partition (each ticker symbol). It sums the `amount`, `tax`, and `commission` from the `Transactions` belonging to that specific ticker's partition group. The `ticker_symbol` is carried over from the partition key.
4.  **`result`**: This final `CALCULATE` computes the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) using the aggregated values (`total_amount_sells`, `total_tax`, `total_commission`) according to the provided formula.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`price_info`**: We start with `DailyPrices` and use `CALCULATE` to extract the `month` in 'YYYY-MM' format and retrieve the `symbol` from the related `ticker`. We also keep the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices needed for aggregation.
2.  **`ticker_monthly_aggregates`**: We partition `price_info` by `symbol` and `month`. Within each group (each ticker's specific month), we calculate the `avg_close`, `max_high`, and `min_low` using aggregation functions (`AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) applied to the `DailyPrices` within that partition group.
3.  **`symbol_groups`**: We re-partition the results (`ticker_monthly_aggregates`) by `symbol`. This creates groups where each group contains all the monthly aggregate rows for a single ticker.
4.  **`result`**: We access the monthly data within each symbol group (`symbol_groups.monthly_groups`). Here, we calculate:
    *   `prev_avg_close`: We use the `PREV` window function to get the `avg_close` from the previous row *within the same symbol group*. `by=month.ASC()` ensures we look at the chronologically previous month, and `per=""symbol_groups""` ensures this calculation is done independently for each ticker symbol based on the ancestor partition name. `default=None` handles the first month for each ticker where there's no previous month.
    *   `momc`: We calculate the month-over-month change using the formula `(avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`. We use `IFF` to check that `prev_avg_close` is not `None` and not zero before performing the division, returning `None` otherwise.
5.  **Final `CALCULATE` and `ORDER_BY`**: We select only the required output columns (`symbol`, `month`, `avg_close`, `max_high`, `min_low`, `momc`) and order the results by symbol and then by month for readability.",32.46964431,"# Step 1: Calculate monthly aggregates (avg close, max high, min low) for each ticker symbol

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Tickers.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Tickers` collection and filter it to include only those tickers that have at least one entry (`HAS(...) == 1`) in their `historical_prices` sub-collection within the specified date range (`date >= ""2023-04-01""` and `date <= ""2023-04-04""`). This avoids calculations for tickers with no relevant data.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each qualifying ticker:
    *   `ticker_symbol=symbol`: Selects the ticker's symbol.
    *   `max_high_in_range=MAX(...)`: Calculates the maximum `high` price from the `historical_prices` that fall within the specified date range.
    *   `min_low_in_range=MIN(...)`: Calculates the minimum `low` price from the `historical_prices` that fall within the specified date range.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: A second `CALCULATE` is used because the `price_change` calculation depends on the results of the aggregations (`max_high_in_range`, `min_low_in_range`) performed in the previous step.
    *   `price_change=max_high_in_range - min_low_in_range`: Calculates the difference between the highest high and lowest low found in the range for that ticker.
4.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=price_change.DESC())`**: Selects the top 3 tickers based on the calculated `price_change`, ordered in descending order (highest change first).
5.  **`.CALCULATE(symbol=ticker_symbol, price_change=price_change)`**: Selects only the final required fields (`symbol` and `price_change`) for the output, renaming `ticker_symbol` back to `symbol` as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`transaction_info = Transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step accesses the `Transactions` collection and calculates two new fields for each transaction: `cust_state` (derived from the related customer's state) and `tick_type` (derived from the related ticker's type). This makes these fields directly available on the transaction level for partitioning.
2.  **`partitioned_transactions = transaction_info.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `transaction_info` collection into groups. Each group (`state_type_groups`) represents a unique combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.
3.  **`combination_counts = partitioned_transactions.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data. For each unique combination (group), it calculates:
    *   `customer_state`: The state from the partition key `cust_state`.
    *   `ticker_type`: The ticker type from the partition key `tick_type`.

2.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and filter it.
3.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70`**: This condition filters customers based on their `join_date`. `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of days between the customer's `join_date` and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`). We keep customers where this difference is less than or equal to 70 days.
4.  **`.transactions_made`**: For the customers who meet the date criteria, we access their associated transactions using the `transactions_made` relationship.
5.  **`COUNT(...)`**: We count the total number of transactions found in the `transactions_made` sub-collection of the filtered customers.
6.  **`num_transactions_recent_customers=...`**: The final count is assigned to the field `num_transactions_recent_customers`.",11.13724494,"recent_customers_transactions = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Customers` collection and filters it to include only those customers who have at least one transaction associated with them (using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). This addresses the requirement to ignore customers without transactions.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step processes the filtered customers.

    *   **`time_to_first_transaction_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, MIN(transactions_made.date_time))`**: This calculates the time difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and their earliest transaction date.
        *   `MIN(transactions_made.date_time)`: Finds the minimum (earliest) `date_time` among all transactions made by the customer. The `MIN` aggregation function is necessary because `transactions_made` is a plural sub-collection.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: Calculates the difference between the customer's `join_date` (a singular field) and the calculated minimum transaction date, returning the result in days.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, we calculate a new set of fields.
    *   `cust_id=_id`, `cust_name=name`: We keep the customer's ID and name, temporarily renaming them to avoid potential conflicts in subsequent steps.
    *   `transaction_count=COUNT(...)`: We calculate the number of relevant transactions for the customer.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We access the customer's transactions and filter them.
        *   `(transaction_type == ""sell"")`: We keep only transactions where the type is ""sell"".
        *   `(DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day') == ""2023-04-01"")`: We compare the date part of the `date_time` field (by truncating it to the start of the day) with the target date ""2023-04-01"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: We count how many transactions passed the filter.
2.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=transaction_count.DESC())`**: From the results of the previous step (which contains all customers and their respective transaction counts), we select the single record (`1`) that has the highest `transaction_count` (ordered descending `DESC`).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: On the single top customer record obtained, we select the final fields.
    *   `_id=cust_id`, `name=cust_name`: We select the customer's ID and name, renaming them back to the original field names as requested.
    *   `number_of_transactions=transaction_count`: We select the calculated count and rename it to `number_of_transactions` as requested in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`successful_q1_2023_transactions`**: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those records where the `status` is 'successful', the `YEAR` of the `date_time` is 2023, and the `MONTH` of the `date_time` is within the first quarter (1, 2, or 3) using `ISIN`.
2.  **`transactions_with_month`**: This step calculates the `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` from the `date_time` field for the filtered transactions. These calculated fields are necessary for partitioning.
3.  **`monthly_avg_price`**:
    *   This partitions the `transactions_with_month` data into groups based on the unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`. The partition group is named `monthly_groups`.
    *   Within each monthly group, it calculates two fields:
        *   `month`: A string representation of the month in 'YYYY-MM' format, created by joining the `transaction_year` and the zero-padded `transaction_month`.
        *   `average_price`: The average `price` of all transactions belonging to that specific month's group, calculated using the `AVG` aggregation function on the `Transactions.price` within the partition context.
    *   Finally, it orders the results by the `month` string in ascending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We calculate `start_period_date` (the first day of the week 9 weeks ago) and `end_period_date` (the first day of the current week). This defines the time window covering the last 8 full calendar weeks.
2.  **Filter High-Value Sales:** We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only sales where `sale_price` is greater than 30,000.
3.  **Access Payments:** We navigate from the filtered `Sales` to their associated `payment` records (which are `PaymentsReceived`).
4.  **Filter Payments by Date:** We filter these payments using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `payment_date` falls within our calculated time window (`>= start_period_date` and `< end_period_date`).
5.  **Calculate Week Information:** For the filtered payments, we use `CALCULATE` to determine the start date of the calendar week (`payment_week_start`) using `DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of week')` and a boolean flag (`is_weekend_payment`) indicating if the payment occurred on a Saturday or Sunday using `ISIN` and `DAYNAME`.
6.  **Partition by Week:** We use `PARTITION` to group the payments based on their `payment_week_start`. Each partition (`weekly_group`) contains all the payments made within that specific week.
7.  **Aggregate Counts:** Within each week's partition, we use `CALCULATE` again:
    *   We select the `payment_week_start` and rename it to `week`.
    *   `total_payments_received` is calculated by counting all payments within the partition using `COUNT(payments_with_week_info)`.
    *   `weekend_payments_received` is calculated by summing the `is_weekend_payment` boolean flag (where True=1, False=0) for payments within the partition using `SUM(payments_with_week_info.is_weekend_payment)`.
8.  **Order Results:** Finally, we use `ORDER_BY(week.ASC())` to sort the weekly summaries chronologically by the week's start date.
9.  **Assign to Result:** The final ordered summary is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.54316044,"# Define the start and end dates for the last 8 full calendar weeks

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Cars` collection and calculate uppercase versions of `make`, `model`, and `vin_number` to ensure case-insensitive matching and grouping later.
2.  **`.WHERE(CONTAINS(upper_vin, 'M5'))`**: We filter the cars to include only those where the uppercase `vin_number` contains the substring 'M5'. `CONTAINS` provides partial matching.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(upper_make, upper_model))`**: We partition the filtered cars into groups based on their uppercase `make` and `model`. This groups cars of the same make and model together, ignoring case differences (e.g., ""Toyota"" and ""toyota"" are grouped together).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group created by the partition:
    *   `car_make=upper_make`: Selects the uppercase make (the grouping key).

result = Dealership.CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: It selects sales where the associated car's make is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 29`: It further filters these sales to include only those where the difference between the `sale_date` and the current date (`'now'`) is 29 days or less. This effectively selects sales from the last 30 days, including today.
    *   `&`: Both conditions must be true for a sale to be included.
2.  **`result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line performs calculations on the top-level `Dealership` context, using the filtered sales data.
    *   `num_sales = COUNT(recent_toyota_sales)`: It counts the number of records in the `recent_toyota_sales` filtered collection, giving the total number of Toyota sales in the specified period.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(recent_toyota_sales.sale_price)`: It sums the `sale_price` for all sales included in the `recent_toyota_sales` collection, calculating the total revenue generated from these sales.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: Starts with the `Salespersons` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes:

    *   `last_name`: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   `total_sales_amount`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` from all associated sales records (`sales_made`) for each salesperson.
    *   `num_sales`: Counts the total number of sales records (`sales_made`) for each salesperson.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first one and adds the sales rank (SR):
    *   It retains `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_sales_amount`, and `num_sales`.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=total_sales_amount.DESC())`: Calculates the rank (`SR`) for each salesperson based on their `total_sales_amount` in descending order (highest sales amount gets rank 1).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_with_latest_status = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we calculate the `sale_price`, the `make` and `model` of the associated car (`car.make`, `car.model`), and determine the car's latest inventory status.
2.  **`latest_is_in_inventory=DEFAULT_TO(...)`**: This part finds the latest inventory snapshot for the car associated with the sale (`car.inventory_snapshots`).
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1` ranks the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) by date descending and selects the top-ranked one (the latest).
    *   `.SINGULAR().is_in_inventory` accesses the `is_in_inventory` field of that single latest snapshot.
    *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., True)` ensures that if a car has no snapshots (making the status unknown), it defaults to `True` (in inventory), effectively excluding it later.
3.  **`sales_of_cars_not_in_inventory = sales_with_latest_status.WHERE(latest_is_in_inventory == False)`**: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only the sales records where the associated car's latest inventory status is `False` (meaning it's confirmed not in inventory).
4.  **`grouped_by_make_model = sales_of_cars_not_in_inventory.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the filtered sales records using the car's `make` and `model` as keys. This groups all sales for the same make/model combination together.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(make=car_make, model=car_model, highest_sale_price=MAX(Sales.sale_price))`**: Within each partition (group), we calculate the final output fields: `make`, `model`, and `highest_sale_price`. `MAX(Sales.sale_price)` finds the maximum `sale_price` among all the sales records belonging to that specific make/model group.
6.  **`result = grouped_by_make_model.ORDER_BY(highest_sale_price.DESC())`**: Finally, we sort the resulting groups based on the `highest_sale_price` in descending order (highest price first).",46.05266619,"# Step 1: Start with Sales data and calculate the latest inventory status for the associated car.

2.  **`(LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')) | (LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%'))`**: This is the filtering condition.
    *   `LOWER(make)` and `LOWER(model)`: Converts the `make` and `model` fields to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
    *   `LIKE(..., '%ford%')`: Checks if the lowercase `make` contains ""ford"" anywhere within it (partial match).
    *   `LIKE(..., '%mustang%')`: Checks if the lowercase `model` contains ""mustang"" anywhere within it (partial match).
    *   `|`: The OR operator combines the two conditions, selecting cars that match either the make or the model criteria.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Selects the desired fields and calculates the average sale price for the filtered cars.
    *   `make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`: Selects the basic car details.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries:** We first determine the start of the current month (`current_month_start`) and the date 6 months prior to that (`period_start`) using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  **Filter and Prepare Sales Data:** We access the `Sales` collection and filter records where the `sale_date` falls within our target period (`period_start` inclusive, `current_month_start` exclusive). In the same step, we use `CALCULATE` to:
    *   Create a `sale_month` field in 'YYYY-MM' format using `JOIN_STRINGS`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `LPAD` (to ensure correct sorting).
    *   Keep the `sale_price` for later aggregation.
    *   Extract the `salesperson_hire_year` using `YEAR(salesperson.hire_date)` for filtering within the partition.
3.  **Partition by Month:** We partition the prepared `sales_data` using `PARTITION(name=""months"", by=sale_month)`. This groups all sales from the target period by the month they occurred in.
4.  **Calculate Monthly Metrics:** We apply a `CALCULATE` operation on the `monthly_groups`:
    *   We select the `month` (which is the `sale_month` partition key).
    *   We define `relevant_sales_in_month` by filtering the `Sales` within each month's partition (`Sales` here refers to the records belonging to that specific month group) using a `WHERE` clause to keep only sales where the `salesperson_hire_year` (calculated earlier) is between 2022 and 2023.
    *   `PMSPS` (Per Month Salesperson Sales count) is calculated by `COUNT(relevant_sales_in_month)`.
    *   `PMSR` (Per Month Sales Revenue) is calculated by `SUM(relevant_sales_in_month.sale_price)`. If no relevant sales occurred in a month that had *other* sales, these metrics will correctly be 0.
5.  **Order Results:** Finally, `ORDER_BY(sale_month.ASC())` sorts the results chronologically.
6.  **Assign Result:** The final calculated and ordered data is assigned to the `result` variable.",39.44074702,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the 6-month period prior

    *   `PaymentsReceived`: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection, as each record represents a payment received.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)`: For each payment record, this calculates the difference in ""days"" between the `sale_date` (accessed through the `sale_record` link back to the `Sales` collection) and the `payment_date` of the payment itself.
    *   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of all the day differences computed for each payment record.
3.  `ROUND(..., 2)`: The result of the `AVG` function is then rounded to 2 decimal places as requested.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `Sales` collection to include only those sales records where the year of the `sale_date` is 2023.
2.  **`revenue_and_cost = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: This calculates two aggregate values based on the filtered `sales_in_2023`:
    *   `total_revenue_2023`: Sums the `sale_price` for all sales that occurred in 2023.
    *   `total_cost_2023`: Sums the `cost` of the associated `car` for each sale in 2023. It accesses the cost through the `Sales.car` relationship.
3.  **`gpm_calculation = revenue_and_cost.CALCULATE(...)`**: This line calculates the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) using the previously computed `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023`.
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `total_cost_2023` is zero.
    *   If `total_cost_2023` is zero, it assigns `0.0` to `gpm_2023` to prevent division by zero errors.
    *   Otherwise, it applies the GPM formula: `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100.0`. We use `100.0` to ensure floating-point division for the percentage calculation.
4.  **`result = gpm_calculation`**: The final result, containing the calculated `gpm_2023`, is assigned to the `result` variable.",16.92607069,"# Filter sales records for the year 2023

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_on_exit_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Sales` collection and filter it.
2.  **`HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the core filtering condition. For each `Sale`, it checks if the associated `car` has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) record in its `inventory_snapshots` sub-collection that meets the nested `WHERE` criteria.
3.  **`(is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date)`**: This nested `WHERE` clause filters the `inventory_snapshots` for the specific car. It looks for snapshots where the car was marked as *not* in inventory (`is_in_inventory == False`) and where the `snapshot_date` of that inventory record is exactly the same as the `sale_date` of the current `Sale` being evaluated.
4.  **`top_priced_sale = sales_on_exit_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`**: After filtering to get only sales that occurred on the inventory exit day, we use `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` to select the single sale (`1`) with the highest `sale_price` in descending order (`DESC()`).
5.  **`result = top_priced_sale.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we use `CALCULATE` on the resulting top sale record to extract the required fields:
    *   `make=car.make`: Accesses the `make` field from the `car` linked to the sale.
    *   `model=car.model`: Accesses the `model` field from the `car` linked to the sale.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`payment_info = PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step extracts the `year` and `month` from the `payment_date` for each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  **`monthly_totals = payment_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `payment_info` data first by `pay_year` and then by `pay_month`. This groups all payments that occurred within the same calendar month.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)` after PARTITION**: Within each monthly group, we calculate:
    *   `pay_year`, `pay_month`: These are kept from the partition keys, primarily needed for correct sorting in the next step.
    *   `year_month_str`: A string representation ""YYYY-MM"" is created for easier display of the month. `LPAD` ensures the month is always two digits (e.g., ""2023-01"").
    *   `total_monthly_payments`: The `SUM` aggregation function calculates the total `payment_amount` for all payments within that specific month's group.
4.  **`result = monthly_totals.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the collection of monthly totals.
    *   `year_month`, `total_payments`: These fields are selected for the final output.
    *   `mom_change`: This calculates the month-over-month change.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_payments, by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC()), default=0.0)`: This window function retrieves the `total_monthly_payments` value from the *previous* record.
        *   `by=(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())`: This crucial part tells `PREV` how to determine the ""previous"" record – it orders the monthly totals chronologically by year and then by month.
        *   `default=0.0`: For the very first month in the dataset, there is no preceding month. This sets the ""previous"" value to 0.0 for that initial calculation, so the `mom_change` for the first month will be equal to its `total_payments`.
        *   The final calculation subtracts the previous month's total (obtained via `PREV`) from the current month's total.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(pay_year.ASC(), pay_month.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are sorted chronologically by year and month to present the MoM trend clearly.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars`**: We start with the `Cars` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**: This filters the `Cars` collection. The `HASNOT(sale_records)` function checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to `Sales`) is empty for each car. We keep only those cars where this condition is true (i.e., they have no associated sales records). This achieves the equivalent of a left join and filtering for nulls on the right side in SQL.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and renames the desired fields (`_id`, `make`, `model`, `year`) for the cars that passed the filter. We rename `_id` to `car_id`, `make` to `car_make`, `model` to `car_model`, and `year` to `car_year` for clarity.",6.445727348,"cars_without_sales = Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1).CALCULATE(

    *   `.WHERE(payment_method == 'cash')`: Filters these payments to include only those where the `payment_method` is 'cash'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Checks if the result of the filtered payments (for any sale made by the salesperson) is not empty. In other words, it checks if the salesperson has at least one sale for which a cash payment was received.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id)`**: For the salespersons who satisfy the `WHERE` condition, this selects their `_id` and renames it to `salesperson_id`.

3.  **`sales_count_last_30_days=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 30))`**: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection. We then filter these sales using `WHERE` to include only those where the difference between the `sale_date` and the current date (`'now'`) is less than or equal to 30 days. Finally, `COUNT` counts how many sales records remain after filtering.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(termination_date) == 1)`**: This starts with the `Salespersons` collection and filters it to include only those records where the `termination_date` field exists (is not null), ensuring we only consider salespersons who have actually been terminated.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the required fields:
    *   `salesperson_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', first_name, last_name)`: Creates a full name by joining the `first_name` and `last_name` with a space.
    *   `salesperson_phone=phone`: Selects the salesperson's phone number.
    *   `employment_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", hire_date, termination_date)`: Calculates the duration of employment in days by finding the difference between the `termination_date` and the `hire_date`.
3.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=employment_days.ASC())`**: This selects the single record (`k=1`) that has the smallest value for the calculated `employment_days` field, effectively finding the salesperson with the shortest time between hiring and termination. The `.ASC()` ensures we sort in ascending order to find the minimum.

The final result `shortest_tenure_salesperson` will contain the name, phone number, and employment duration (in days) for the salesperson with the shortest tenure.",15.18896031,"shortest_tenure_salesperson = Salespersons.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Dealership` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count).
2.  **`num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_weekend_utility_payments` and assign it the result of the `COUNT` aggregation function.
3.  **`PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `COUNT`, we specify the collection to count from (`PaymentsMade`) and apply filters using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`**: This condition filters for payments made specifically to the vendor named 'Utility Company'.
5.  **`ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`**: This condition checks if the payment date falls on a weekend.
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)` extracts the name of the day (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))` checks if the extracted day name is either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"".
6.  **`&`**: The ampersand combines the two conditions, ensuring that we only count payments that meet *both* criteria (vendor is 'Utility Company' AND the payment was made on a weekend).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**: We first calculate the start and end dates of the *previous* ISO week relative to the current time (`'now'`).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` finds the beginning of the current week (e.g., Monday).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` subtracts 7 days to find the start of the previous week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 day')` subtracts 1 day from the start of the current week to find the end date (inclusive) of the previous week (e.g., Sunday).
2.  **`payments_in_prev_week = date_boundaries.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `PaymentsReceived` collection through the `date_boundaries` context (which makes `start_of_prev_week` and `end_of_prev_week` available) and filter the records where the `payment_date` falls within the calculated range of the previous week.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered payments, we prepare the data for partitioning:
    *   `payment_day=DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: We extract just the date part from `payment_date` to group payments by day, ignoring the time component.
    *   We keep `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for the next steps.
4.  **`daily_totals_by_method = payments_in_prev_week.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the prepared payment data.
    *   `name=""daily_method_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups.
    *   `by=(payment_day, payment_method)`: Groups the data first by the day of payment and then by the payment method within each day.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, we calculate the desired output for each group:
    *   `payment_date=payment_day`: Selects the day (renamed from `payment_day` for clearer output).
    *   `payment_method=payment_method`: Selects the payment method for the group.
    *   `total_daily_amount=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all records belonging to the specific day/method group. We refer back to the original collection (`PaymentsReceived`) within the `SUM` function as required after partitioning.
6.  **`.ORDER_BY(payment_date.ASC(), payment_method.ASC())`**: Sorts the final results first by date in ascending order, and then by payment method within each date.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`sales_2023_info = Sales.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection and filters it to include only sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023 using `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023`.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each filtered sale, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `cust_state=customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
    *   `qtr_start_date=IFF(...)`: Determines the starting date of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions (similar to IF-ELSEIF-ELSE):
        *   If the month is 1-3 (Q1), it takes the start of the year (`DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of y')`).
        *   If the month is 4-6 (Q2), it takes the start of the year plus 3 months.
        *   If the month is 7-9 (Q3), it takes the start of the year plus 6 months.
        *   Otherwise (month 10-12, Q4), it takes the start of the year plus 9 months.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""state_quarters"", by=(cust_state, qtr_start_date))`**: This groups the `sales_2023_info` records based on unique combinations of the calculated `cust_state` and `qtr_start_date`. Each group represents a specific state and quarter.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This final calculation operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the state for the group.
    *   `quarter_start=qtr_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
    *   `total_quarterly_sales=SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all the original `Sales` records that belong to the current state/quarter group.

    *   `((YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023) & (MONTH(snapshot_date) == 3))`: This filters snapshots taken in March 2023.
    *   `(is_in_inventory == True)`: This further filters for snapshots where the car was marked as being in inventory.
    *   `(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Cars"") == 1)`: This is the crucial part for finding the *latest* snapshot. It ranks the snapshots for each car (`per=""Cars""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Drugs` collection because we want a result for each drug. `CALCULATE` is used to select the `drug_name` and compute the new `average_ddd` field.
2.  **`average_ddd=AVG(...)`**: We calculate the average DDD using the `AVG` aggregation function. This function operates on the values calculated for the associated treatments of each drug.
3.  **`treatments_used_in`**: Inside `AVG`, we access the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection, which links each drug to its treatments.
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: We filter these treatments based on the DDD definition criteria:
    *   `end_dt != None`: Ensures the treatment has a defined end date.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0`: Calculates the treatment duration in days and ensures it's positive to avoid division by zero or invalid durations.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, we perform an inner `CALCULATE` to determine its individual DDD value (`ddd_val`).
    *   `ddd_val=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This implements the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
6.  **`.ddd_val`**: We access the `ddd_val` calculated in the inner step. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these `ddd_val` values for all valid treatments associated with the current drug.
7.  **`result = avg_ddd_per_drug`**: The final result, containing `drug_name` and `average_ddd` for each drug, is assigned to the `result` variable.",27.40655851,"# Calculate average DDD for each drug

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate two key dates using `DermTreatment.CALCULATE`:
    *   `start_of_current_month`: The first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_of_period`: The first day of the month three months prior to the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')`.
2.  **`relevant_treatments`**: We access the `Treatments` collection starting from `date_boundaries`.
    *   We filter these treatments using `WHERE` to keep only those whose `start_dt` falls within the desired period (from `start_of_period` up to, but not including, `start_of_current_month`).
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to create new fields for each relevant treatment:
        *   `treatment_month`: Formats the `start_dt` into a 'YYYY-MM' string for grouping. `LPAD` ensures the month has two digits (e.g., '2023-05').
        *   `is_biologic_treatment`: A boolean flag indicating if the treatment's associated drug (`Treatments.drug`) has `drug_type == 'biologic'`.
        *   `patient_key`: Extracts the `patient_id` from the related patient (`Treatments.patient`) which is needed for distinct counting later.
3.  **`monthly_groups`**: We partition the `relevant_treatments` collection using `PARTITION`.
    *   `name=""months""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(treatment_month)`: Groups the treatments based on the calculated `treatment_month`.
4.  **`result`**: We perform the final calculation on the partitioned data.
    *   `month = treatment_month`: Selects the month identifier.
    *   `total_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_key)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_key` values within each month's partition group (`Treatments` here refers to the treatments within that specific month's group).
    *   `biologic_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(Treatments.patient_key, Treatments.is_biologic_treatment))`: Counts the number of unique `patient_key` values *only* for those treatments where `is_biologic_treatment` is true within each month's group. `KEEP_IF` returns the `patient_key` if the condition is true, otherwise null; `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique non-null keys.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total count). `CALCULATE` is used to compute this value.
2.  **`num_patients_gmail_yahoo=COUNT(...)`**: We define a new field `num_patients_gmail_yahoo` to store the result. The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of records in the collection provided to it.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Patients` collection and apply a filter using `WHERE`.
4.  **`ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"") | ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")`**: This is the filter condition.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@gmail.com"")` checks if the `email` field ends with the string ""@gmail.com"".
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, ""@yahoo.com"")` checks if the `email` field ends with the string ""@yahoo.com"".
    *   The `|` operator represents a logical OR, so the filter keeps patients whose email ends with *either* ""@gmail.com"" *or* ""@yahoo.com"".

**Explanation:**

1.  `Patients.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Patients` collection.
2.  `HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This checks if each patient has at least one (`HAS(...) == 1`) treatment record within their `treatments_received` list that satisfies the inner `WHERE` condition.
3.  `(diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')`: This inner condition filters the treatments, ensuring that the treatment's associated diagnosis name is exactly 'Psoriasis vulgaris' AND the treatment's associated drug type is 'biologic'.
4.  `filtered_patients = ...`: This assigns the resulting collection of patients (those who meet the criteria) to the `filtered_patients` variable.
5.  `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(distinct_patient_count=COUNT(filtered_patients))`: Finally, we use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a calculation. `COUNT(filtered_patients)` counts the number of records in the `filtered_patients` collection, which represents the distinct count of patients meeting the specified criteria.

2.  **`end_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`**: This calculates the date corresponding to the beginning of the current month.
3.  **`alice_treatments_in_period = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This filters the `Treatments` collection based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):

    *   `start_dt >= start_period`: Ensures the treatment started on or after the beginning of the 6-month window.
    *   `start_dt < end_period`: Ensures the treatment started before the beginning of the current month, effectively excluding the current month.
4.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: This performs a final calculation at the top level (`DermTreatment`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`doctor_drug_counts = Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step starts with the `Doctors` collection and calculates initial information for each doctor:
    *   `doc_id=doc_id`: Selects the doctor's ID.
    *   `speciality=speciality`: Selects the doctor's specialty.
    *   `num_distinct_drugs=NDISTINCT(prescribed_treatments.drug.drug_id)`: Calculates the count of unique drug IDs associated with the treatments prescribed by each doctor. `prescribed_treatments` links to `Treatments`, `drug` links that treatment to a `Drugs` record, and `drug_id` is the field we count distinctly.

2.  **`specialty_groups = doctor_drug_counts.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the results from the previous step based on the `speciality` field. Doctors are now grouped together based on their specialty. The partition is named `spec_group`.

3.  **`result = specialty_groups.Doctors.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step operates on the partitioned data.
    *   `specialty_groups.Doctors`: Accesses the individual doctor records within each specialty partition created in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: Selects the final required fields for each doctor within their specialty group:
        *   `doc_id=doc_id`: The doctor's ID (already calculated).
        *   `speciality=speciality`: The doctor's specialty (already calculated).
        *   `num_distinct_drugs=num_distinct_drugs`: The count of distinct drugs (already calculated).
        *   `SDRSDR=RANKING(by=num_distinct_drugs.DESC())`: Calculates the rank (`SDRSDR`) for each doctor *within their specialty group* (because we are operating inside the partition).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the boundaries for our time window using the `DermTreatment` high-level collection.
    *   `current_month_start`: Finds the first day of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
    *   `start_range`: Calculates the first day of the month that was 12 months prior to the `current_month_start` using `DATETIME(..., '-12 months')`.
2.  **`monthly_treatments_filtered`**: We start with the `Treatments` collection, accessed via `date_boundaries` to inherit the calculated dates.
    *   `CALCULATE(treatment_month=DATETIME(start_dt, 'start of month'))`: For each treatment, we extract the starting month by truncating the `start_dt` to the beginning of its month.
    *   `WHERE(...)`: We filter these treatments to include only those whose `treatment_month` falls within our desired range: greater than or equal to `start_range` and strictly less than `current_month_start`. This effectively selects treatments from the last 12 full months, excluding the current incomplete month.
3.  **`monthly_stats`**: We partition the filtered treatments.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""months"", by=treatment_month)`: Groups the treatments based on the `treatment_month` calculated previously.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`: For each monthly group (`months`):
        *   `month=treatment_month`: Selects the month identifier.
        *   `PMPD=NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Calculates the Per Month Patient Diagnoses (PMPD) by counting the number of unique `patient_id`s within that month's treatments. Since each treatment links a patient and a diagnosis, this counts distinct patients diagnosed/treated in that month.
        *   `PMTC=COUNT(Treatments)`: Calculates the Per Month Treatment Count (PMTC) by counting the total number of treatments within that month's group.
    *   `ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patients_on_drugalin = Drugs.WHERE(drug_name == 'Drugalin').treatments_used_in.patient`**: This line first filters the `Drugs` collection to find the drug record(s) where the `drug_name` is exactly 'Drugalin'.

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

1.  **`patient_first_treatment_year`**: This part identifies the year each patient had their *first* treatment.
    *   It starts with the `Patients` collection.
    *   `MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)` finds the earliest `start_dt` among all treatments for each patient.
    *   `YEAR(min_start_dt)` extracts the year from this earliest date.
    *   `.WHERE(HAS(first_treatment_year)==1)` ensures we only consider patients who actually have treatments (and thus a `min_start_dt`).

2.  **`yearly_new_patients`**: This part counts the number of new patients for each year.
    *   It takes the `patient_first_treatment_year` data.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=first_treatment_year)` groups the patients based on the year they had their first treatment.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` then computes:
        *   `year`: The year of the first treatment (the partition key).
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of patients within that year's partition (`COUNT(Patients)`).

3.  **`result`**: This final step calculates the New Patient Increase (NPI).
    *   It takes the `yearly_new_patients` counts.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` computes:
        *   `year`: The year.
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of new patients for that year.
        *   `NPI`: The difference between the current year's `num_new_patients` and the previous year's count.
            *   `PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC(), default=num_new_patients)` retrieves the `num_new_patients` value from the preceding record when ordered by `year`.
            *   `default=num_new_patients` handles the very first year in the dataset; since there's no previous year, `PREV` returns the current `num_new_patients`, resulting in an NPI of 0 for the first year.

4.  **`avg_pasi_day100 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi.day100_pasi_score)`**: Similarly, calculates the overall average of `day100_pasi_score` from the filtered records.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ae_info = AdverseEvents.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection. For each event, we calculate:
    *   `is_same_month`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the adverse event's `reported_dt` match the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of the associated `treatment.start_dt`.
    *   `drug_id` and `drug_name`: We retrieve the ID and name of the drug involved in the treatment by navigating through `treatment.drug`.
2.  **`drug_event_counts = ae_info.PARTITION(...)`**: We partition the `ae_info` data by `drug_id` and `drug_name`. This groups all adverse event records associated with the same drug.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each drug partition (`drug_group`), we calculate:
    *   `drug_id` and `drug_name`: We keep the partitioning keys.
    *   `num_adverse_events`: We use `SUM(drug_group.is_same_month)`. Since boolean `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in summation, this effectively counts how many adverse events within that drug's group had the `is_same_month` flag set to `True`.
4.  **`top_drug_by_ae = drug_event_counts.TOP_K(...)`**: We take the results (one row per drug with its same-month adverse event count) and select the single (`1`) row with the highest `num_adverse_events` using `TOP_K` with descending order (`DESC`).
5.  **`result = top_drug_by_ae.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select the required fields (`drug_id`, `drug_name`, `num_adverse_events`) from the top drug record.",26.04355121,"# Calculate a flag for each adverse event indicating if it occurred in the same month as the treatment start date

**Explanation:**

1.  **`treatments_2022 = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting the `Treatments` collection. It then filters these treatments based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):
    *   `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`: It keeps only treatments where the year of the `end_dt` (end date) is 2022.
    *   `HAS(outcome_records.day100_pasi_score) == 1`: It ensures that the treatment has at least one associated outcome record where the `day100_pasi_score` is present (not null).
    *   `.CALCULATE(ins_type = patient.ins_type)`: For the filtered treatments, it calculates a new temporary field `ins_type` by accessing the `ins_type` from the related `patient`. This is necessary because `ins_type` will be used as the partitioning key.

2.  **`partitioned_by_insurance = treatments_2022.PARTITION(...)`**: This takes the filtered `treatments_2022` data and partitions it.
    *   `name=""insurance_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition groups (though not strictly used later in this query).
    *   `by=(ins_type)`: Groups the treatments based on the unique values of the `ins_type` field calculated in the previous step.

3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This operation is performed on each partition group (i.e., for each unique insurance type).
    *   `insurance_type = ins_type`: Selects the insurance type (which is the partition key).
    *   `avg_pasi_100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of the `day100_pasi_score` from the `outcome_records` associated with the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
    *   `distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id`s associated with the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.

4.  **`top_5_ins_types_by_pasi = partitioned_by_insurance.TOP_K(...)`**: This takes the results (one row per insurance type with its calculated average PASI and distinct patient count) and selects the top records.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 records.
    *   `by=avg_pasi_100.ASC()`: Defines the sorting criteria. It sorts the insurance types based on their `avg_pasi_100` in ascending order (`ASC()`), meaning the lowest average scores come first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cutoff_date_calc`**: This calculates the cutoff date, which is 6 calendar months before the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` achieves this. This value is calculated at the top level (`DermTreatment`) so it can be accessed later.
2.  **`specialty_groups`**: This partitions the `Doctors` collection based on their `speciality`. Each partition (`specialties`) represents a unique specialty.
3.  **`specialty_stats`**: This calculation is performed on each specialty partition:
    *   `doc_specialty=speciality`: Selects the specialty name (the partition key).
    *   `total_drug_prescribed=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments (`Doctors.prescribed_treatments`) associated with doctors in that specialty partition, but only including treatments where the `start_dt` is on or after the calculated `cutoff_date`.
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with doctors in that specialty partition, again filtering for treatments where `start_dt` is on or after the `cutoff_date`.
    *   `.WHERE(num_treatments > 0)`: Filters out any specialties that had zero treatments meeting the date criteria.
4.  **`top_specialties`**: This selects the top 3 records from `specialty_stats` based on the `total_drug_prescribed` in descending order.
5.  **`result = top_specialties`**: Assigns the final result to the `result` variable.

result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Treatments` collection based on multiple conditions combined using the logical AND operator (`&`).
2.  **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition filters treatments linked to a diagnosis whose name (`diag_name`) contains the substring 'psoriasis'. `LOWER()` makes the comparison case-insensitive, and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards allows matching anywhere within the string.
3.  **`HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`**: This checks if the drug associated with the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`). `HAS(...) == 1` ensures the field exists and is not null.
4.  **`HAS(end_dt) == 1`**: This ensures that the treatment record has an end date specified.
5.  **`(end_dt > DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) & (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`**: This compound condition filters treatments that ended within the last 6 months.
    *   `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates the date and time exactly 6 months prior to the current moment.
    *   `end_dt > ...` ensures the treatment ended *after* 6 months ago.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `end_dt <= ...` ensures the treatment ended on or before the current moment (i.e., not in the future).
6.  **`result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We use the top-level `DermTreatment` collection to perform a final calculation.
7.  **`count_of_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)`**: This counts the number of records remaining in the `filtered_treatments` collection after all the `WHERE` conditions have been applied and assigns the count to the `count_of_treatments` field.",19.39300919,"# Filter treatments based on diagnosis name, drug FDA approval, and end date

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`context_info = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: First, we calculate the `target_reg_year`. This is done by finding the maximum `year_reg` across all doctors using `MAX(Doctors.year_reg)` and subtracting 2. This value is calculated once at the top level (`DermTreatment`).
2.  **`doctors_filtered = context_info.Doctors.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Doctors` collection via `context_info` (which allows access to `target_reg_year`). We filter this collection to keep only doctors where:
    *   Their `year_reg` matches the calculated `target_reg_year`.
    *   They have prescribed at least one treatment, checked using `HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1`.
3.  **`result = doctors_filtered.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform the main calculation on the filtered doctors.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`, `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: We select the doctor's last name and registration year, renaming them temporarily.
    *   `first_treatment_info=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(...)`: For each doctor, we find their first treatment.
        *   We access the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection for the current doctor.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"") == 1`: We rank these treatments based on their `start_dt` in ascending order (`ASC`). The `per=""Doctors""` ensures the ranking is done independently for each doctor. We filter to keep only the treatment(s) ranked 1 (the earliest).
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `WHERE` returns a collection (even if it contains only one item), and the outer `CALCULATE` expects a singular value here, `SINGULAR()` is used to extract the single record representing the first treatment. This assumes each doctor has a unique earliest treatment start date or picks one if there's a tie.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The final `CALCULATE` selects the desired output fields and renames them according to the request: `last_name`, `year_reg`, `first_treatment_id` (extracted from `first_treatment_info`), and `first_treatment_start_dt` (extracted from `first_treatment_info`).",26.992378,"# Calculate the target registration year (2 years before the latest registration year found in the data)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `AdverseEvents` collection because we are primarily interested in filtering these events based on their timing relative to the treatment start.

3.  **`(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: This condition filters the adverse events. It selects events where the `reported_dt` is on or after the `treatment.start_dt` (difference is 0 or more days) AND no more than 10 days after the `treatment.start_dt` (difference is 10 days or less).
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This selects and potentially renames the final fields for the output.

    *   The treatment is a placebo (`is_placebo == True`).
    *   The treatment has at least one associated concomitant medication (`concomitant_meds`) whose start date (`start_dt`) is within 14 days *after* the treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`). This is checked using `HAS()` combined with `WHERE` and `DATEDIFF`. The `DATEDIFF` condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures the med started on or after the treatment, but no more than 14 days later.
3.  For the treatments that satisfy these conditions (`qualifying_treatments`), the query accesses their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This retrieves *all* concomitant medications associated with each qualifying treatment, not just the ones that met the date criteria in the filter step.
4.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used on this sub-collection to select the desired fields for each concomitant medication record, referencing its parent treatment's details:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the qualifying placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the qualifying placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the qualifying placebo treatment.
    *   `med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication.
    *   `med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.
5.  The `result` variable holds a collection where each row corresponds to a concomitant medication linked to a placebo treatment that had at least one med starting within the specified 2-week window.",33.34074783,"# Filter treatments to find those that are placebo and have at least one concomitant med starting

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the average age).
2.  **`avg_male_private_age=AVG(...)`**: We define a new field `avg_male_private_age` and assign it the result of the `AVG` aggregation function.
3.  **`Patients.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `AVG` function, we access the `Patients` collection and filter it using `WHERE`.
4.  **`(gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'Private')`**: The filter condition selects patients whose `gender` is 'Male' AND whose `ins_type` is 'Private'.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, 'now'))`**: For the filtered patients, we calculate a new temporary field `age_in_years`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF` function to find the difference in full years between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (`'now'`).
6.  **`.age_in_years`**: We access the calculated `age_in_years` field. The `AVG` function then computes the average of these ages for all patients who met the filter criteria.",12.75018144,"# Calculate the average age of male patients with private insurance

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_name=name`**: Selects the merchant's name.
3.  **`num_distinct_successful_tx=NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').txid)`**:
    *   Accesses the transactions received by the merchant (`transactions_received`).
    *   Filters these transactions to include only those with `status == 'completed'`.
    *   Counts the number of distinct transaction IDs (`txid`) within these successful transactions using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  **`num_distinct_coupons_used=NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed').coupon.cid)`**:
    *   Again, accesses the successful transactions received by the merchant.
    *   Navigates to the associated coupon (`coupon`).
    *   Counts the number of distinct coupon IDs (`cid`) used in these successful transactions using `NDISTINCT`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: The second `CALCULATE` uses the results from the first one.
6.  **`merchant_name=merchant_name`**: Carries forward the merchant name calculated in the previous step.
7.  **`cpur=IFF(num_distinct_successful_tx > 0, num_distinct_coupons_used / num_distinct_successful_tx, 0.0)`**:
    *   Calculates the CPUR (Coupon Usage Rate).
    *   Uses the `IFF` function to handle potential division by zero:
        *   If the number of distinct successful transactions (`num_distinct_successful_tx`) is greater than 0, it calculates CPUR as `num_distinct_coupons_used / num_distinct_successful_tx`.
        *   Otherwise (if there are no successful transactions), it assigns a CPUR of `0.0`.

# Assign the final result to the variable
result = weekly_notification_summary

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries`**: We first calculate the necessary date boundaries using the `Ewallet` top-level collection:
    *   `current_week_start`: The start date of the current week (using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`).
    *   `three_weeks_ago_start`: The start date of the week 3 weeks prior to the current week (using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-3 weeks')`).
2.  **`filtered_notifications`**: We start with the `Notifications` collection, accessed via `date_boundaries` to inherit the calculated dates.
    *   We filter notifications based on three conditions combined with `&` (AND):
        *   The associated user's country is either 'US' or 'Canada' (`ISIN(user.country, (""US"", ""Canada""))`).
        *   The `created_at` timestamp is on or after the start of the week 3 weeks ago (`created_at >= three_weeks_ago_start`).
        *   The `created_at` timestamp is before the start of the current week (`created_at < current_week_start`). This excludes the current week.
    *   We then use `CALCULATE` to derive two new fields for each filtered notification:
        *   `notification_week_start`: Truncates the `created_at` timestamp to the beginning of its week using `DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`. This will be our grouping key.
        *   `is_weekend_notification`: A boolean flag (True/False) indicating if the `created_at` date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`.
3.  **`weekly_notification_summary`**: We partition the `filtered_notifications` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(notification_week_start))`: This groups the notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Inside the `CALCULATE` applied to these weekly groups:
        *   `week_start = notification_week_start`: We select the week's start date.
        *   `total_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications)`: We count all notifications within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_notifications_count = SUM(is_weekend_notification)`: We sum the `is_weekend_notification` flag. Since True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in sums, this effectively counts only the notifications sent on weekends within that group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by week.

    *   `sending_user.country == ""US""`: Selects transactions where the sending user's country is ""US"".
    *   `transaction_type == ""wallet""`: Selects transactions specifically marked as 'wallet' type.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 6`: Filters transactions created within the last 7 days, inclusive of today. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in full days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date (`'now'`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`recent_user_balances = UserBalances.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, 'now') <= 7)`**: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only records where the `updated_at` timestamp falls within the last 7 days (inclusive) from the current time ('now').
2.  **`user_amb_calculation = recent_user_balances.PARTITION(name=""user_updates"", by=(user_id)).CALCULATE(...)`**: This partitions the filtered `recent_user_balances` into groups based on `user_id`. For each group (i.e., for each unique user with recent balance updates):

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection because we want a result for each user.
2.  **`user_id=uid`**: We select the user's unique identifier (`uid`).
3.  **`latest_balance=...`**: We define a new field called `latest_balance`.
4.  **`balances`**: We access the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user.
5.  **`.TOP_K(1, by=updated_at.DESC())`**: Within each user's balances, we find the top 1 record when ordered by the `updated_at` timestamp in descending order. This effectively selects the most recent balance record.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchant_revenues = Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and filter it using `WHERE` to include only merchants who have received at least one transaction with a `status` of 'completed'. This is checked using `HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(status == 'completed')) == 1`. Accessing `transactions_received` implicitly filters for transactions where the merchant is the receiver.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the filtered merchants, we calculate:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `merchant_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category.
    *   `total_revenue=SUM(...)`: Calculates the total revenue for each merchant by summing the `amount` of their received transactions that have a `status` of 'completed'.
3.  **`result = merchant_revenues.CALCULATE(...)`**: We perform a second `CALCULATE` on the `merchant_revenues` collection to:
    *   Select the `merchant_name` and `merchant_category` again.
    *   Rename `total_revenue` to `revenue_amount` as requested.
    *   Calculate the `revenue_rank` using the `RANKING` window function. `RANKING(by=total_revenue.DESC())` assigns rank 1 to the merchant with the highest `total_revenue`, rank 2 to the second highest, and so on, across all merchants in the `merchant_revenues` collection.
4.  **`.ORDER_BY(revenue_rank.ASC())`**: Finally, the results are ordered by the calculated `revenue_rank` in ascending order, so the merchant with rank 1 appears first.",19.95650554,"# Calculate total revenue for each merchant from completed received transactions

**Explanation:**

1.  **`date_boundaries = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates the necessary date boundaries using the `DATETIME` function.
    *   `start_current_month`: Finds the first moment of the current month.
    *   `start_two_months_ago`: Finds the first moment of the month that started two months before the current month.
2.  **`filtered_transactions = date_boundaries.Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: This selects transactions from the `Transactions` collection based on several criteria:
    *   `sender_type == 0`: Filters for transactions where the sender is a user (as per the definition provided).
    *   `(created_at >= start_two_months_ago) & (created_at < start_current_month)`: Filters transactions to include only those created within the last two full months (from the start of two months ago up to, but not including, the start of the current month).
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within the filtered transactions, this step:
    *   Keeps the `sender_id` needed for the distinct count.
    *   Creates a `transaction_month` field by extracting the year and month from `created_at` and formatting it as ""YYYY-MM"" using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent sorting and display.
4.  **`pmdau_results = filtered_transactions.PARTITION(...)`**: This partitions the `filtered_transactions` data.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups""`: Assigns a name to the partition context.
    *   `by=(transaction_month)`: Groups the transactions based on the calculated `transaction_month`.
5.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After partitioning, this calculates the final result for each group (each month):
    *   `month = transaction_month`: Selects the month identifier for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Time Boundaries:** We first determine the start date of the current month using `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` and then calculate the start date of the previous month by subtracting one month using `DATETIME(start_of_current_month, '-1 month')`.
2.  **Filter Transactions:** We filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those whose `created_at` timestamp falls within the previous month (greater than or equal to the start of the previous month and less than the start of the current month).
3.  **Count Total Transactions:** We count the total number of transactions found within the filtered `transactions_previous_month` collection using `COUNT()`.
4.  **Count Successful Transactions:** We further filter the `transactions_previous_month` collection to include only transactions where the `status` is 'completed' (assuming this indicates success) and count these using `COUNT()`.
5.  **Calculate STR:** We calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR) by dividing the `successful_transactions_count` by the `total_transactions_count` and multiplying by 100.0 to express it as a percentage. We use the `IFF` function to check if `total_transactions_count` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero errors, returning 0.0 if there were no transactions.
6.  **Final Result:** The calculated STR percentage is assigned to the `previous_month_str_percentage` field within the top-level `Ewallet` context and stored in the `result` variable.",15.43767905,"# Define the start of the current month and the start of the previous month

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Merchants` collection and use `CALCULATE` to process each merchant.
2.  **`merchant_mid=mid, merchant_name=name`**: We select the merchant's `mid` and `name` and assign them to new variables for clarity and later use.
3.  **`num_coupons_same_month=COUNT(...)`**: We calculate a new field `num_coupons_same_month` for each merchant.
4.  **`coupons.WHERE(...)`**: Inside the `COUNT` aggregation, we access the `coupons` sub-collection associated with the current merchant and filter them using `WHERE`.
5.  **`(YEAR(created_at) == YEAR(Merchants.created_at)) & (MONTH(created_at) == MONTH(Merchants.created_at))`**: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `YEAR(created_at)` and `MONTH(created_at)` extract the year and month from the *coupon's* `created_at` field (since the context inside `WHERE` is the `coupons` sub-collection).
    *   `YEAR(Merchants.created_at)` and `MONTH(Merchants.created_at)` extract the year and month from the *parent merchant's* `created_at` field.
    *   The condition keeps only those coupons created in the exact same calendar month and year as their parent merchant.
6.  **`COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of coupons that satisfy the `WHERE` condition for the current merchant.
7.  **`merchant_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_same_month.DESC())`**: After calculating the count for all merchants, we use `TOP_K` to select the single merchant (`k=1`) who has the highest `num_coupons_same_month`. `DESC()` ensures we get the highest value.
8.  **`top_merchant.CALCULATE(...)`**: Finally, we select and rename the required fields (`mid`, `name`, `num_coupons`) from the top merchant record identified in the previous step.",30.58196497,"# Calculate the number of coupons created in the same month as the merchant for each merchant

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection based on several criteria:
    *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Ensures only transactions from the year 2023 are considered.
    *   `status == 'completed'`: Filters for successful transactions.
    *   `sender_type == 'user'`: Ensures the sender was a user, excluding merchants.
    *   `sending_user.status == 'active'`: Filters transactions where the sending user was active at the time (or based on their current status, depending on implementation details).
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we calculate two new fields:
    *   `transaction_month_date = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of month')`: Extracts the date corresponding to the start of the month from the transaction's `created_at` timestamp. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `user_id = sending_user.uid`: Retrieves the unique ID of the sending user. This is needed to count distinct users later.
3.  **`.PARTITION(name=""monthly_data"", by=(transaction_month_date))`**: We partition the results based on the `transaction_month_date`. This groups all transactions that occurred within the same month.
4.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: Within each monthly partition (`monthly_data`), we calculate the final output fields:
    *   `month_as_date = transaction_month_date`: Selects the month date (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_active_users = NDISTINCT(monthly_data.user_id)`: Counts the number of unique `user_id` values within the current month's partition. This gives the count of distinct active users who sent money in that month.
5.  **`.ORDER_BY(month_as_date.ASC())`**: Finally, we sort the results in ascending order based on the `month_as_date`, ensuring the output starts from the earliest month in 2023.",29.58989024,"# Start with transactions and filter for relevant ones

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(HAS(transactions_sent.WHERE(sender_type == 0)) == 1)`**: This filters the `Users` collection to include only those users who have sent at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_sent...`) where the `sender_type` is 0 (indicating the sender is a user).
2.  **`.PARTITION(name=""country_groups"", by=(country))`**: This groups the filtered users based on their `country`. Each group represents a unique country containing users who meet the initial criteria.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This step calculates aggregated values for each country group created by the partition:
    *   `country=country`: Selects the country name (which is the partition key).
    *   `num_distinct_users=COUNT(Users)`: Counts the number of unique users within the current country group. Since we partitioned the filtered users, this gives the count of distinct users from that country who sent transactions with `sender_type = 0`.

**Explanation:**

2.  **`HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150)) == 1`**: This ensures we only consider merchants who have received at least one transaction (`transactions_received`) where the transaction's `created_at` date is within the last 150 days (inclusive) from the current time (`'now'`). `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, 'now') <= 150` calculates the difference in days and checks if it's 150 or less.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the merchants who passed the filter, we calculate new fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Renames the `name` field to `merchant_name`.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all `transactions_received` that fall within the last 150 days. The `WHERE` clause inside the `SUM` ensures only relevant transactions are aggregated.
    *   `num_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of `transactions_received` that fall within the last 150 days, again using the `WHERE` clause for filtering.
4.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=total_amount.DESC())`**: This selects the top 2 records from the result based on the calculated `total_amount`, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC()`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `active_retail_merchant_balances = MerchantBalances.WHERE(...)`: This line starts with the `MerchantBalances` collection, which contains the balance information for merchants. It then filters these records using `WHERE`.
2.  `(merchant.status == 'active')`: This condition filters for balances belonging to merchants whose `status` field is exactly 'active'. We access the merchant's properties via the `merchant` relationship.
3.  `CONTAINS(merchant.category, 'retail')`: This condition further filters the balances, keeping only those whose associated merchant has a `category` field that includes the substring 'retail'.
4.  `&`: The ampersand combines the two conditions, requiring both to be true for a balance record to be included in `active_retail_merchant_balances`.
5.  `median_merchant_balance = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates a single aggregate value using the top-level `Ewallet` collection context.
6.  `median_balance = MEDIAN(active_retail_merchant_balances.balance)`: Inside the `CALCULATE`, the `MEDIAN` aggregation function is used.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`snapshots_in_2023 = UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`**: This line filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only those records where the year of the `snapshot_date` is 2023.
2.  **`earliest_snapshots_in_2023 = snapshots_in_2023.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True) == 1)`**: This line takes the snapshots from 2023 and ranks them based on their `snapshot_date` in ascending order (earliest first). The `RANKING(...) == 1` condition filters the results to keep only the snapshot(s) with rank 1, which corresponds to the earliest date(s) in 2023. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest date, all of them are included.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.WHERE(...)`**: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
2.  **`HASNOT(...) == 1`**: This function checks if a sub-collection (in this case, filtered notifications) is empty. We want users for whom this condition is true.
3.  **`notifications.WHERE(...)`**: For each user, we look at their `notifications` sub-collection and filter it.
4.  **`created_at <= DATETIME(created_at, '+1 year')`**: This is the filtering condition for notifications. It compares the notification's `created_at` timestamp with a date calculated by adding one year to the user's `created_at` timestamp (their signup date). We keep notifications that occurred *within* or *on* the end date of the user's first year.
5.  **`HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: Putting it together, this checks if a user has *no* notifications that fall within their first year after signing up.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For the users who meet the `WHERE` condition, we select their `username`, `email`, and their original `created_at` date, renaming the latter to `signup_date` for clarity.
7.  **`result = ...`**: The final filtered and calculated data is assigned to the `result` variable.",17.61695409,"import datetime
