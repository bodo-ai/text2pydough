      "# **PYDOUGH CHEAT SHEET**  \n",
      "This cheat sheet is a context for learning how to create PyDough code. You must follow all the written rules. Each section represents important features and rules to keep in mind when developing PyDough code. \n",
      "\n",
      "## **GENERAL RULES**: \n",
      "\n",
      "  - Always use TOP_K instead of ORDER_BY when you need to order but also select a the high, low or an specific \"k\" number of records.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - PARTITION function ALWAYS need 3 parameters `Collection, name and by`. The “by” parameter must never have collections, subcollections or calculations. Any required variable or value must have been previously calculated, because the parameter only accept expressions. \n",
      "\n",
      "  - Always keep in mind the order of the query. For example, if I tell you to give me the name and the phone_number, give them to me in this order, first the “name” column and then the “phone_number” column. \n",
      "\n",
      "  - In PyDough, complex calculations can often be expressed concisely by combining filters, transformations, and aggregations at the appropriate hierarchical level. Instead of breaking problems into multiple intermediate steps, leverage CALCULATE to directly aggregate values, use WHERE to filter data at the correct scope, and apply functions like SUM or TOP_K at the highest relevant level of analysis. Avoid unnecessary partitioning or intermediate variables unless absolutely required, and focus on composing operations hierarchically to streamline solutions while maintaining clarity and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - PyDough does not support use different childs in operations, for example you cannot do: `total = SUM(orders.lines.extended_price * (1 - orders.lines.discount))` because you have two different calls. Instead use CALCULATE with a variable, for example: `total = SUM(orders.lines.CALCULATE(total = extended_price * (1 - discount)).total)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **1. COLLECTIONS & SUB-COLLECTIONS**  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Syntax** \n",
      "Access collections/sub-collections using dot notation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Examples**:  \n",
      "  - `People` → Access all records in the 'People' collection.  \n",
      "  - `People.current_address` → Access current addresses linked to people.  \n",
      "  - `Packages.customer` → Access customers linked to packages.  \n",
      "\n",
      "## **2. CALCULATE EXPRESSIONS**  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Purpose**\n",
      "Derive new fields, rename existing ones or select specific fields.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Syntax**\n",
      "Collection.CALCULATE(field=expression, ...)  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Examples**:  \n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Select fields**:  \n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    People.CALCULATE(first_name=first_name, last_name=last_name)\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Derived fields**:\n",
      "    ```python  \n",
      "    Packages.CALCULATE(  \n",
      "        customer_name=JOIN_STRINGS(' ', customer.first_name, customer.last_name),  \n",
      "        cost_per_unit=package_cost / quantity  \n",
      "    )\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Rules**  \n",
      "  - Use aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) for plural sub-collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Positional arguments must precede keyword arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Terms defined in a CALCULATE do not take effect until after the CALCULATE completes.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - Existing terms not included in a CALCULATE can still be referenced but are not part of the final result unless included in the last CALCULATE clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "  - A CALCULATE on the graph itself creates a collection with one row and columns corresponding to the properties inside the CALCULATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **3. FILTERING (WHERE)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Syntax** \n",
      ".WHERE(condition)  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Examples** \n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Filter people with negative account balance**:  \n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    People.WHERE(acctbal < 0)\n",
      "    ```  \n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Filter packages ordered in 2023**  \n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    Packages.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 2023)\n",
      "    ``` \n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Filter addresses with occupants** \n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    Addresses.WHERE(HAS(current_occupants))\n",
      "    ```  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Rules**  \n",
      "  - Use & (AND), | (OR), ~ (NOT) instead of and, or, not.  \n",
      "  - Avoid chained comparisons (e.g., replace a < b < c with (a < b) & (b < c)).\n",
      "\n",
      "## **4. SORTING (ORDER_BY)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Syntax** \n",
      "  .ORDER_BY(field.ASC()/DESC(), ...)  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Parameters**  \n",
      "\n",
      "  .ASC(na_pos='last') → Sort ascending, nulls last.  \n",
      "\n",
      "  .DESC(na_pos='first') → Sort descending, nulls first.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Examples** \n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Alphabetical sort**:\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    People.ORDER_BY(last_name.ASC(), first_name.ASC())\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "  - **Most expensive packages first**:  \n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    Packages.ORDER_BY(package_cost.DESC())\n",
      "    ```  \n",
      "\n",
      "## **5. SORTING TOP_K(k, by=field.DESC())**  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Purpose**\n",
      "Select top k records.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Syntax**  \n",
      "  .TOP_K(k, by=field.DESC())\n",
