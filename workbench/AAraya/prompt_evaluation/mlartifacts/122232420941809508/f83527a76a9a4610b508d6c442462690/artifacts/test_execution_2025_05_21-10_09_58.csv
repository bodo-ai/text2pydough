**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates:
        *   `c_name`: The customer's name.
        *   `num_total_transactions`: The total number of transactions made by the customer, using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `num_successful_transactions`: The number of successful transactions. This is calculated by counting transactions in `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `""Completed""`. **Note:** This assumes that a transaction status of `""Completed""` signifies a successful transaction, as the definition of ""success"" was not provided in the problem description.

2.  **`eligible_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`**:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It keeps only those customers who have `num_total_transactions` greater than or equal to 5, as per the requirement.

3.  **`customer_success_data = eligible_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `eligible_customers` and calculates their transaction success rate.
    *   It selects:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer (renamed from `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculated as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and performs floating-point division. Division by zero is not a concern here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures `num_total_transactions` is at least 5.

4.  **`ordered_customer_success_rates = customer_success_data.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, this step sorts the `customer_success_data` by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest), as requested.
    *   The `ordered_customer_success_rates` variable will contain the final list of customer names and their success rates, ordered appropriately.",29.532318353652958,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer.

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Filter the `Customers` collection based on two conditions:
    *   The customer's `email` must end with "".com"".
    *   The customer must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
3.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions.

We will use a contextless expression to define the FAANG symbols for clarity. Then, we will filter the `Customers` collection using `WHERE` with combined conditions. The `ENDSWITH` function will check the email, and `HAS` combined with `ISIN` will check for FAANG stock transactions. Finally, `Broker.CALCULATE` with `COUNT` will give the total number of such distinct customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols_list = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols_list`, containing the ticker symbols for FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_with_faang_trades = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the `email` field of a customer ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols_list))) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction related to FAANG stocks.
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols_list))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through the `ticker` relationship from `Transactions` to `Tickers`) is present in the `faang_symbols_list`.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Returns true if the filtered list of transactions is not empty (i.e., the customer has made at least one FAANG stock transaction).
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers satisfying both are included.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE((join_date >= ""2023-01-01"") & (status == ""Active""))`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):

        *   `status == ""Active""`: Selects customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result `filtered_customers` is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., they are TAC as per the definition).

2.  **`tac_by_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country))`: This groups the filtered customers by their `country`. Each group (partition) will contain active customers from a specific country who joined on or after the specified date.
    *   `.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`: For each country group created by the partition:

        *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers within that specific country group. Since these customers have already been filtered, this gives the Total Active Customers (TAC) for that country.

1.  **Filter Stock Transactions and Add Temporal Information**:
    *   Start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, calculate two new fields:
        *   `transaction_week_start_date`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This is derived using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday""), derived using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.

2.  **Define and Filter by Time Window**:
    *   Calculate `current_week_start`: The start date of the current week, using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Calculate `earliest_relevant_week_start`: The start date of the 8th week prior to the current week. This is `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-56 days')` (since 8 weeks = 56 days).
    *   Filter the transactions prepared in Step 1 to include only those where `transaction_week_start_date` is greater than or equal to `earliest_relevant_week_start` AND less than `current_week_start`. This effectively selects transactions from the last 8 full weeks, excluding the current ongoing week.

3.  **Group by Week and Aggregate Counts**:
    *   Partition the filtered transactions from Step 2 by `transaction_week_start_date`. This creates groups, where each group represents a unique week.
    *   For each weekly group, calculate:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (renaming the partition key).
        *   `total_stock_txns`: The total count of stock transactions within that week, using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns`: The count of stock transactions within that week that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Order the final results by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `stock_transactions_with_temporal_info`: This first step filters all `Transactions` to keep only those related to 'Stock' tickers. It then augments each of these transactions with two new calculated fields: `transaction_week_start_date` (which identifies the Monday of the week the transaction occurred) and `day_name_of_transaction` (the name of the day, like ""Saturday"").
2.  `transactions_in_relevant_period`:
    *   We use `Broker.CALCULATE` to define two key dates: `def_current_week_start` (the Monday of the current week) and `def_earliest_week_to_include` (the Monday of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week).
    *   It then takes the `stock_transactions_with_temporal_info` and filters them to include only transactions whose `transaction_week_start_date` falls within the range `[def_earliest_week_to_include, def_current_week_start)`. This selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   This step takes the `transactions_in_relevant_period` and partitions them using `transaction_week_start_date` as the key. This means all transactions that fall into the same week (based on their calculated `transaction_week_start_date`) are grouped together.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), it calculates:
        *   `week_start_date_output`: The start date of that specific week.
        *   `total_stock_txns_for_week`: The total number of stock transactions that occurred in that week.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns_for_week`: The number of stock transactions from that week that occurred on either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", using the `day_name_of_transaction` field calculated earlier.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date_output` in descending order, so the most recent of the 8 weeks appears first.",41.60754919052124,"# Step 1: Filter stock transactions and add week and day name information

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the date range for ""last week"".
    *   `start_of_this_week_val`: This will be the beginning of the current week (e.g., if today is Wednesday, it's the preceding Monday). This also serves as the exclusive end date for ""last week"".
    *   `start_of_last_week_val`: This will be the beginning of the week prior to the current week (e.g., seven days before `start_of_this_week_val`).
    These are calculated using the `DATETIME` function with `'start of week'` and date arithmetic.

2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those where the `customer.country` is ""USA"".
    *   We further filter these transactions to ensure their `date_time` falls within our defined ""last week"" range: `date_time >= start_of_last_week_val` and `date_time < start_of_this_week_val`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   `num_transactions`: We count the number of transactions that meet the above criteria using the `COUNT()` function.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: We sum the `amount` field of these filtered transactions using the `SUM()` function.

4.  **Return Values**: The final result will contain `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` high-level collection, where we first calculate the date boundaries and then use them in a subsequent `CALCULATE` to get the desired aggregates.

```python
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    # Define the start of the current week and the start of last week
    start_of_this_week_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week'),
    start_of_last_week_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection to define global values.
    *   `start_of_this_week_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week. This will serve as the exclusive upper bound for ""last week's"" transactions.
    *   `start_of_last_week_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week immediately preceding the current week. This is the inclusive lower bound.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` uses the date boundaries defined in the first one.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(...)`: This counts the transactions that satisfy the specified conditions.
        *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(Transactions.customer.country == ""USA"")`: Ensures the transaction was made by a customer whose country is ""USA"". We access the customer's country via the `customer` relationship on the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(Transactions.date_time >= start_of_last_week_val) & (Transactions.date_time < start_of_this_week_val)`: Filters transactions to include only those that occurred on or after the start of last week and before the start of the current week.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(...)`: This sums the `amount` of the transactions that meet the same criteria.
        *   The `WHERE` clause is identical to the one used for `COUNT`, ensuring we are summing amounts for the same set of transactions.

*   `CR` is determined by the `RANKING()` function, which ranks customers based on their `total_trans_amount`. `total_trans_amount.DESC()` ensures that customers with higher total transaction amounts get lower (better) rank numbers. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple customers have the same total transaction amount, they will share the same rank.",41.135660886764526,"# Calculate basic aggregates: customer name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount for each customer.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first calculate the start and end dates for our period of interest. The start date is the beginning of the month 6 months ago, and the end date is the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined time window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month**: For each selected customer, we determine their signup month in a 'YYYY-MM' format. This will be used for grouping.
4.  **Partition by Signup Month**: We group the filtered customers by their `signup_month_str`.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month group, PMCS is the count of customers who signed up in that month. This is `COUNT(Customers)`.
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month group, PMAT is the average transaction amount across all transactions made by customers who signed up in that month. This is `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`.
6.  **Order Results**: The results are ordered by the signup month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top `Broker` level to define `start_period_date` (6 months ago, start of that month) and `end_period_date` (start of the current month). These dates define our window of interest.
2.  `.Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and filter them to include only those whose `join_date` is within our calculated `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month_str=...)`: For these filtered customers, we create a new field `signup_month_str` by combining the year and month of their `join_date` (e.g., ""2023-07""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""signup_months_group"", by=(signup_month_str))`: We then partition these customers into groups based on their `signup_month_str`.
5.  `.CALCULATE(signup_month=signup_month_str, PMCS=COUNT(Customers), PMAT=AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount))`: For each group (i.e., for each signup month):
    *   `signup_month`: We output the signup month string.
    *   `PMCS`: We calculate `COUNT(Customers)` which counts the number of customers within that specific `signup_month_str` group.
    *   `PMAT`: We calculate `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions (`transactions_made`) from all customers who signed up in that particular month and computes the average of their transaction `amount`.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection, as we need to group by `ticker_type`.
2.  Partition the `Tickers` collection by the `ticker_type` field. This creates groups for each unique ticker type.
3.  For each `ticker_type` group, we need to calculate the ACP. This involves:
    a.  Accessing the `historical_prices` for all tickers within the current `ticker_type` group.
    b.  Filtering these `historical_prices` to include only records from the last 7 days. The `DATEDIFF` function can be used here, comparing the `date` of the price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). ""Last 7 days inclusive of today"" means the difference should be between 0 and 6 days.
    c.  Calculating the average of the `close` prices from these filtered historical records using the `AVG` aggregation function.
4.  The final result will include the `ticker_type` and the calculated `average_closing_price`.

        ).close  # Get the closing prices from the filtered records
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Tickers.PARTITION(name=""ticker_type_groups"", by=(ticker_type))`: This groups all tickers by their `ticker_type`. Each group, named `ticker_type_groups` internally (though not directly used in the `CALCULATE` part for the aggregation source), will contain tickers of a specific type.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed for each `ticker_type` group created by the partition.
    *   `ticker_type=ticker_type`: This selects the `ticker_type` (which is the partition key) for the output.
    *   `average_closing_price=AVG(...)`: This calculates the Average Closing Price (ACP).
        *   `Tickers.historical_prices`: Within each partition group (e.g., for `ticker_type = 'STOCK'`), this refers to the `historical_prices` of all tickers belonging to that specific type ('STOCK').
        *   `.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This filters the `historical_prices` to include only those records where the `date` is within the last 7 days (inclusive of today). `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the price record's `date` and the current moment. `<= 6` ensures we capture today (0 days diff), yesterday (1 day diff), ..., up to 6 days ago.
        *   `.close`: From these filtered daily price records, it takes the `close` price.
        *   `AVG(...)`: This function then computes the average of these selected `close` prices for the current `ticker_type` group.

1.  **Filter Customers**: Select customers whose `join_date` is in the year 2022.
2.  **Prepare Data for Aggregation**: For these filtered customers, create two boolean flags:
    *   `is_active_flag`: True if the customer's `status` is 'Active'.
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: True if the customer has made at least one transaction (i.e., `transactions_made` sub-collection is not empty).
    We also select the `country` to be used for partitioning.
3.  **Partition by Country**: Group the prepared customer data by their `country`.
4.  **Aggregate Counts per Country**: For each country group:
    *   Calculate `num_active_with_trans`: The number of customers who are active (`is_active_flag` is True) AND have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True). This is the numerator for the AR.
    *   Calculate `num_total_with_trans`: The number of customers who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True). This is the denominator for the AR.
5.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: For each country, compute AR using the formula: `(num_active_with_trans * 100.0) / num_total_with_trans`. If `num_total_with_trans` is zero, AR will be 0.0 to avoid division by zero errors.
6.  **Select Final Output**: Return the `country` and the calculated `AR`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_filtered_info`: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022. It then calculates three new fields for each of these customers:
    *   `cust_country`: The customer's country, which will be used as a key for grouping.
    *   `is_active_flag`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the customer's `status` is 'Active', and `False` otherwise.
    *   `has_transactions_flag`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the customer has at least one transaction (checked using `HAS(transactions_made) == 1`), and `False` otherwise.

    *   `num_total_with_trans`: The count of customers in that country group who have transactions (`has_transactions_flag` is True).

3.  `activity_ratio_by_country`: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the Activity Ratio (AR) for each country:

1.  Define the start of the ""past month"" period using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.

3.  For these filtered transactions, calculate necessary fields: the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction amount (`amount`), and the combined costs (`tax + commission`).
4.  Partition these processed transactions by the ticker symbol.
5.  For each ticker symbol group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_amount_from_sells` by summing the `transaction_amount` for all transactions in that group.
    *   Calculate `total_transaction_costs` by summing the `transaction_costs` for all transactions in that group.
6.  Finally, calculate the SPM using the formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_transaction_costs) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly one month prior to the current moment. This will be used to filter transactions.
2.  `relevant_transactions_data = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time >= one_month_ago_date))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that are of `transaction_type` ""sell"" AND occurred on or after `one_month_ago_date`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate:
        *   `ticker_symbol_val = ticker.symbol`: Extracts the stock symbol associated with the transaction.
        *   `current_transaction_amount = amount`: Takes the transaction amount.
        *   `current_transaction_costs = tax + commission`: Calculates the sum of tax and commission for the transaction.
3.  `spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker = relevant_transactions_data.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the `relevant_transactions_data` by `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `name=""transactions_for_ticker""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(ticker_symbol_val)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol_output = ticker_symbol_val`: Carries over the ticker symbol.
        *   `total_sells_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_amount)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_amount` values for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
        *   `total_costs_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_costs)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_costs` for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
4.  `result = spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the SPM for each ticker.
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_output`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `SPM = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin.
        *   `IFF(total_sells_for_ticker == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This checks if `total_sells_for_ticker` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   `(total_sells_for_ticker - total_costs_for_ticker) / total_sells_for_ticker * 100.0`: If `total_sells_for_ticker` is not zero, this calculates the SPM according to the provided formula. The `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

1.  **Prepare Daily Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each record, calculate the ticker symbol (from the related `ticker` object), the year, and the month of the transaction. Also, keep the daily close, high, and low prices.
2.  **Group and Aggregate Monthly**:
    *   First, partition the prepared daily data by `ticker_symbol_field`. This creates groups for each unique ticker.
    *   Then, within each ticker group, partition by `year_field` and `month_field`. This creates subgroups for each month within each ticker.
    *   For each ticker-month subgroup, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price using the daily values. This results in a collection where each row represents a ticker's performance for a specific month.
3.  **Calculate Previous Month's Average Close**: On this monthly aggregated data:
    *   Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the *previous* month for the *same ticker*.
    *   The `PREV` function will operate `per=""ticker_level_group""` (the name of the partition by ticker) and will be ordered by year and month number to correctly identify the preceding month.
    *   If a month is the first one for a ticker, there's no previous month, so `PREV` will return a default value (e.g., `None`).
4.  **Calculate MoMC and Format Output**:
    *   With the current month's average close and the previous month's average close, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - previous_avg_close) / previous_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where the previous month's average close is `None` or zero to avoid errors.
    *   Format the month as 'YYYY-MM'.
    *   Select the required fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by ticker symbol alphabetically and then by month chronologically.

3.  Filter these records to include only those within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"".
4.  Partition the filtered data by `stock_sym_calc`. This groups all price records for the same stock together.
5.  For each stock group (partition):

6.  Calculate `price_change_output` as `overall_max_h - overall_min_l` for each stock.
7.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_output.DESC())` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest price change in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates the process by iterating through each customer.
    *   `num_transactions_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: For each customer, this calculates the number of transactions they made in the same month and year they joined.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: It accesses the list of transactions for the current customer and filters them.
        *   `(YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date)) & (MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions occurring in the same calendar month and year as the customer's `join_date` are considered. `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions extract the respective parts from the date fields.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts the transactions that satisfy the condition.
    The result of this step is a collection of customers, each with their original fields plus the new `num_transactions_in_join_month` field.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC())`: This takes the collection from the previous step and selects the top 1 customer.
    *   `by=num_transactions_in_join_month.DESC()`: The selection is based on the `num_transactions_in_join_month` field, in descending order, so the customer with the highest count is chosen.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=_id, name=name, number_of_transactions=num_transactions_in_join_month)`: This final step formats the output.
    *   It selects the `_id` and `name` (original fields from the `Customers` collection that were carried through).

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(calculated_total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount))`:

    *   Other original fields of the `Customers` collection, like `name`, are implicitly available for subsequent operations.

2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=calculated_total_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This function takes the collection of customers (each now having the `calculated_total_amount`) and selects the top 5.
    *   The selection is ordered by the `calculated_total_amount` field in descending order (`DESC()`), so customers with higher total transaction amounts come first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `dated_transactions`: This variable stores transactions filtered to be within the date range of January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` function ensures that the time component of `date_time` is ignored, making the date comparison accurate for inclusivity.
2.  `type_summary`:
    *   We partition `dated_transactions` by `transaction_type`. This groups all transactions of the same type together.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
        *   `num_distinct_customers`: The count of unique `customer_id`s who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)` achieves this.
        *   `avg_shares`: The average number of `shares` for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG(Transactions.shares)` calculates this.
3.  `result`: This variable takes `type_summary` and applies `TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`.

    *   `.CALCULATE(country_of_customer = customer.country, current_transaction_amount = amount)`: For each filtered transaction, it extracts the customer's country (aliased as `country_of_customer`) and the transaction amount (aliased as `current_transaction_amount`).

2.  `country_summary_metrics`: This variable groups the `recent_transactions_info` by country and calculates aggregates.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""transactions_by_country"", by=(country_of_customer))`: Groups the transactions based on the `country_of_customer` field. Each group represents a unique country.

2.  Calculate the minimum `close` price from these filtered records using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
3.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest price, calculated at the `Broker` (top graph) level.

1.  `filtered_prices = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by selecting from the `DailyPrices` collection and applies filters.
    *   `ticker.symbol == ""VTI""`: This condition filters the records to include only those associated with the ticker symbol 'VTI'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 days.
        *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the record's `date` and the current date.
        *   `<= 6` ensures we include today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago, covering a 7-day period.
2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final result at the top `Broker` level.
    *   `lowest_vti_closing_price_last_7_days = MIN(filtered_prices.close)`: This creates a new field named `lowest_vti_closing_price_last_7_days`.
        *   `MIN(filtered_prices.close)` computes the minimum value of the `close` field from the `filtered_prices` collection obtained in the previous step.

2.  **`Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70)`**:
    *   This part filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and the current date.
    *   The `WHERE` clause keeps only those customers for whom this difference is less than or equal to 70 days (i.e., joined in the past 70 days).
3.  **`.transactions_made`**: After filtering the customers, this accesses the `transactions_made` sub-collection for all these recently joined customers. This effectively gives a list of all transactions made by this group of customers.
4.  **`COUNT(...)`**: This function then counts the total number of transactions in the `transactions_made` collection obtained from the filtered customers.
5.  **`total_transactions_recent_customers = ...`**: The final count is assigned to the field `total_transactions_recent_customers`.",14.777084112167358,"number_of_transactions_by_recent_joiners = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter out customers who have no transactions using `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`.
3.  For each remaining customer, calculate the required values:
    *   Select the customer's `_id`.
    *   Determine the date of their first transaction. This involves:
        *   Accessing their `transactions_made`.
        *   Ranking these transactions by `date_time` in ascending order (`date_time.ASC()`) *per customer* (`per=""Customers""`).
        *   Filtering for the transaction with rank 1 (`RANKING(...) == 1`).
        *   Using `SINGULAR()` to treat the result as a single transaction record (assuming ""first transaction"" implies a unique earliest one, or picking one if multiple occur at the exact same earliest time).
        *   Accessing the `date_time` of this first transaction.
    *   Calculate the difference in ""days"" between the customer's `join_date` and the `date_time` of their first transaction using `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, first_transaction_date_time)`.

The final output will include the customer's `_id` and the calculated time difference in days.

```python

    days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(

        transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This selects only customers who have at least one transaction. `HAS(transactions_made)` checks for the existence of records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: This includes the customer's original `_id` in the result.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: This calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This complex expression retrieves the date and time of the customer's first transaction:
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions.
                *   `RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"")`: Ranks the customer's transactions by their `date_time` in ascending order. The `per=""Customers""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer.
                *   `== 1`: Selects the transaction(s) with the earliest rank (i.e., the first transaction).
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the resulting collection (which should contain the single earliest transaction, or one of them if ties exist and `allow_ties` defaults to `False`) into a single record context.
            *   `.date_time`: Accesses the `date_time` field of that first transaction.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_prepared = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions in January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""completed""`: Filters for successful transactions. **Note:** We are assuming ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction. If ""successful"" corresponds to a different value in the `status` field, this condition should be adjusted.
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time), transaction_price_val = price)`: This selects and prepares the data needed for the next steps. It creates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from `date_time`, and it selects the `price`, renaming it to `transaction_price_val` for clarity.

2.  `monthly_average_prices = transactions_prepared.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `transactions_prepared` data and groups it.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups"", by=(transaction_month)`: Partitions the data by the `transaction_month`. Each group will correspond to a unique month (1, 2, or 3).
    *   `.CALCULATE(month_num = transaction_month, avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val))`: For each monthly group, this calculates:
        *   `month_num = transaction_month`: The month number for the group.
        *   `avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val)`: The average of `transaction_price_val` for all transactions within that specific month's group.

3.  `result = monthly_average_prices.CALCULATE(...)`: This line formats the final output.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Salespersons` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each salesperson.

            *   **`DATETIME('now')`**: Gets the current date and time.
            *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))`**: Calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date.
            *   **`< 30`**: This condition ensures that only sales made today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago (29 days difference) are included, effectively covering the last 30 days inclusive of today.

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to include only those cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. We'll use `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards for a case-insensitive partial match as requested.
2.  Partition the filtered cars by their `make` and `model`. This will group cars of the same make and model together.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars), calculate:
    *   The `make` of the car.
    *   The `model` of the car.
    *   The total number of sales, which is achieved by counting all `sale_records` associated with the cars in that group.

```python
# Filter cars that have 'M5' in their VIN number (case-insensitive partial match)

    number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)  # Count all sales for cars in this make/model group
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%')` checks if the lowercase version of `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. The `%` are wildcards, meaning 'm5' can appear anywhere in the VIN. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' in the VIN.

2.  `sales_count_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `cars_with_m5_vin` (cars that matched the VIN criteria).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars. Each group will consist of cars having the same `make` and `model`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with all cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` of the cars within the partition group.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   We start by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these sales based on two conditions combined with an `&` (AND) operator:
        *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: This condition ensures that we only consider sales where the `make` of the associated `car` (accessed via `Sales.car.make`) is ""Toyota"".
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: This condition filters sales that occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of today.
            *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
            *   `<= 29` ensures that sales from today (0 days difference) up to 29 days ago are included, covering a 30-day period.

2.  **`toyota_sales_summary = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We use `Dealership.CALCULATE` to create a result with aggregated values. `Dealership` is the top-level collection representing the entire database context.
    *   `number_of_sales = COUNT(filtered_toyota_sales)`: This calculates the total number of sales that met the criteria defined in `filtered_toyota_sales` and assigns it to the field `number_of_sales`.
    *   `total_revenue = SUM(filtered_toyota_sales.sale_price)`: This calculates the sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in `filtered_toyota_sales` and assigns it to the field `total_revenue`.

2.  Calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` records.
3.  Calculate the number of sales for each salesperson by counting their `sales_made` records.
4.  Assign a sales rank (SR) to each salesperson based on their total sales amount in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will receive a lower rank number (e.g., rank 1 for the highest).
5.  Select the salesperson's `first_name`, `last_name`, the calculated `total_sales_amount`, `number_of_sales`, and `SR`.

Two `CALCULATE` steps are used: the first to compute total sales and number of sales, and the second to compute the rank based on these calculated values and to format the final output fields.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them to avoid conflicts in subsequent calculations.
    *   `calc_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales associated with each salesperson via the `sales_made` sub-collection. This sum is stored as `calc_total_sales`.
    *   `calc_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson, storing it as `calc_num_sales`.

2.  `sales_data.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call takes the output of the first (`sales_data`) and performs further calculations and field selection.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`: Passes through the salesperson's first and last names, renaming them to the final requested field names.
    *   `total_sales_amount=calc_total_sales`: Assigns the previously calculated total sales to the final field name `total_sales_amount`.
    *   `number_of_sales=calc_num_sales`: Assigns the previously calculated number of sales to the final field name `number_of_sales`.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=calc_total_sales.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `calc_total_sales` field in descending order (`DESC()`), so the salesperson with the highest total sales gets rank 1.

1.  **Define the Reporting Period**: Calculate the start and end dates for the last 6 months, excluding the current month. The period starts 6 months prior to the beginning of the current month and ends at the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Create a Month Scaffold**: To ensure all relevant months appear in the result (even with zero metrics for specific salespersons), we first identify all unique months within this reporting period that had any sales activity globally. This is done by looking at all sales in the `Dealership.Sales` collection, filtering them by the reporting period, truncating their `sale_date` to the start of the month, and then finding the distinct months.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**: For each distinct month obtained from the scaffold:
    *   Identify sales made by salespersons who were hired between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023.
    *   Filter these sales to include only those that occurred within the specific month being processed.
    *   **PMSPS**: Count the number of such sales.
    *   **PMSR**: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales. If no such sales occurred, these metrics will correctly be 0.
4.  **Format and Order**: The month will be formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". The results will be ordered by month in ascending order.

This approach ensures that any month within the last six (excluding the current) that had at least one sale globally will be listed, and the PMSPS/PMSR for the specified salespersons in that month will be calculated (defaulting to 0 if no relevant sales).

1.  Access each record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  For each payment, determine the difference in days between the `sale_date` of its associated sale (obtained via `sale_record.sale_date`) and its own `payment_date`. This is done using the `DATEDIFF(""days"", ...)` function. This calculation results in a temporary collection of payments, each with a new field holding this day difference.
3.  Calculate the average of these day differences across all payment records.
4.  Round this average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND()` function.
5.  The final result is a single value representing this rounded average, calculated at the `Dealership` (top-level graph) scope.

**Explanation:**

*   `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, intending to produce a single aggregated result.
*   `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_diff = DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:
    *   This part iterates through each payment in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment, `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of days between the `sale_date` (from the linked sale record) and the `payment_date` of the current payment.
    *   The result of this difference is assigned to a temporary new field named `days_diff` for each payment.
    *   This entire expression effectively yields a new temporary collection where each row corresponds to a payment and includes the `days_diff` field.
*   `.days_diff`: This accesses the `days_diff` field from the temporary collection generated in the previous step.
*   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of all the `days_diff` values obtained from all payments.
*   `ROUND(..., 2)`: The calculated average is then rounded to 2 decimal places.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to:
1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for these sales.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of `cost` for the cars sold.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The PyDough code will first calculate the total revenue and total cost for sales in 2023. Then, it will use these values in a subsequent `CALCULATE` step to compute the GPM.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across all relevant sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For these filtered sales, it accesses their `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale in 2023, it navigates to the related `car` (from the `Cars` collection) and accesses its `cost`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_for_2023 = ...)`: This second `CALCULATE` step takes the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023` computed in the first step.
5.  `gpm_for_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023) / total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 * 100`: This applies the GPM formula to calculate the gross profit margin for 2023 sales.

        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: The car was marked as out of inventory.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: The date of this inventory status change matches the `sale_date` of the current sale record. The `sale_date` in this context refers to the `sale_date` of the `Sales` record being evaluated by the outer `WHERE` clause.

1.  Extract the year and month from the `payment_date` for each payment in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2.  Group these payments by year and month using `PARTITION`.
3.  For each year-month group, calculate the sum of `payment_amount` to get the `total_payments` for that month.
4.  Use the `PREV` window function to access the `total_payments` of the previous month. The data will be ordered by year and then by month for the `PREV` function.
5.  Calculate the `mom_change` as (`current month total_payments` - `previous month total_payments`). For the earliest month in the dataset, where there is no preceding month, the `PREV` function will use a default value of `0.0`, so its MoM change will be equal to its total payments.
6.  The results will be ordered by year and month.

This approach will list all months for which there were payments. Months with no payments will not appear in the result, and the MoM calculation for a subsequent month will be based on the last month that did have payments.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days (i.e., from 6 days ago up to and including today). We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` will give the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current moment. This difference should be between 0 (for today's sales) and 6 (for sales made 6 days ago), inclusive.
3.  Count the number of sales records that meet this date criterion.
4.  Assign this count to a field named `TSC` within a `CALCULATE` operation on the top-level `Dealership` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_in_past_7_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.

2.  `total_sales_count_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(TSC=COUNT(sales_in_past_7_days))`: This line calculates the final result.

    *   `total sales amount` can be calculated as `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`.
    *   `number of sales` can be calculated as `COUNT(sales_made)`.
4.  Select the top 3 salespersons based on their calculated ASP in descending order. This is done using `TOP_K(3, by=asp_value.DESC())`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. This is crucial because ASP calculation involves division by the number of sales.
2.  `.CALCULATE(s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name, asp_value=(SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)))`:
    *   This step calculates new fields for each salesperson.

    *   `asp_value=(SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made))` calculates the Average Selling Price (ASP). `SUM(sales_made.sale_price)` gets the total monetary value of all sales made by the salesperson, and `COUNT(sales_made)` gets the total number of sales.

    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection is empty for each car.
    *   `==1` ensures we only keep cars where `HASNOT(sale_records)` is true (i.e., cars with no sales).

Explanation:
-   `Salespersons`: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
-   `.WHERE(HAS(sales_made.payment.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")) == 1)`: This is the core filtering logic.

    -   `.WHERE(payment_method == ""cash"")`: We filter these payments to only include those where the `payment_method` is ""cash"".
    -   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if there is at least one such cash payment associated with any of the salesperson's sales. If a salesperson has made a sale that received a cash payment, this condition will be true.
-   `.CALCULATE(salesperson_id = _id)`: For the salespersons who satisfy the `WHERE` condition, we select their `_id` and rename it to `salesperson_id`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made)==1)`**: This filters the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sales_made` is the sub-collection linking salespersons to their sales records.
    *   `HASNOT(sales_made)==1` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection is empty for each salesperson. It returns `True` (or 1) if the salesperson has no sales records.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id, s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name)`**: This step selects and renames the desired fields for the salespersons who met the filter criteria:
    *   `salesperson_id=_id`: Selects the `_id` field and renames it to `salesperson_id`.
    *   `s_first_name=first_name`: Selects the `first_name` field and renames it to `s_first_name`.
    *   `s_last_name=last_name`: Selects the `last_name` field and renames it to `s_last_name`.

The variable `salespersons_with_no_sales` will then contain the ID, first name, and last name of salespersons who have no sales records. This approach effectively achieves the result of a left join where we keep only those salespersons without matching sales.",9.82024312019348,"salespersons_with_no_sales = Salespersons.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made)==1).CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Sales` collection, as revenue is derived from `sale_price`.
2.  For each sale, we need the customer's state. This can be accessed via `Sales.customer.state`. We also need `Sales.customer_id` to count unique customers and `Sales.sale_price` for revenue.
3.  We'll create an intermediate collection `sales_info` that explicitly calculates `customer_state_val` from `Sales.customer.state`. The `sale_price` and `customer_id` fields are directly available from the `Sales` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(customer_state_val = customer.state)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Sales` collection.
    *   It calculates a new field `customer_state_val` by accessing the `state` of the related `customer` for each sale (`customer.state`).
    *   Fields like `sale_price` and `customer_id` from the `Sales` collection are implicitly carried forward.

2.  `state_summary = sales_info.PARTITION(name=""state_sales_group"", by=(customer_state_val)).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This partitions the `sales_info` data by the `customer_state_val`. Each partition (`state_sales_group`) contains all sales records for a particular state.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these state-level groups:
        *   `state_name_output = customer_state_val`:  Selects the state name (which is the partition key).
        *   `total_revenue_output = SUM(sales_info.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for the current state by summing the `sale_price` of all sales belonging to that state in the `sales_info` collection.
        *   `num_unique_customers_output = NDISTINCT(sales_info.customer_id)`: Counts the number of unique customers in the current state by finding the distinct `customer_id` values from sales records in that state.

    b.  Calculate `total_revenue_in_period` by summing the `sale_price` of these filtered sales. The problem defines revenue as the sum of `sale_price`.
4.  Filter these results to include only salespersons with `total_revenue_in_period > 0`. This ensures that only representatives with positive revenue in the specified period are considered for the top ranking.
5.  Use the `TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue_in_period.DESC())` function to select the top 3 salespersons based on their `total_revenue_in_period` in descending order.
6.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to output the requested fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `total_number_of_sales` (which is `total_num_sales_in_period`), and `total_revenue` (which is `total_revenue_in_period`).

1.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  For each salesperson, calculate the duration of their employment in days using the `DATEDIFF` function between `hire_date` and `termination_date`. This new field will be named `employment_duration_days`. If a salesperson has not been terminated, their `termination_date` might be null, and `DATEDIFF` would likely result in a null duration.
3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to find the single salesperson (k=1) with the minimum `employment_duration_days`. We sort in ascending order (`ASC`) and use `na_pos='last'` to ensure that any salespersons with a null duration (e.g., those still employed or with missing termination dates) are placed at the end of the sort and thus not selected as the minimum.
4.  From this salesperson record, we then use `CALCULATE` to format the output:
    *   `name`: The full name of the salesperson, created by joining `first_name` and `last_name`.
    *   `phone`: The salesperson's phone number.
    *   `days_employed`: The calculated employment duration in days.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, as we want a single aggregated result.
2.  `num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`: This defines the field we want to calculate, which is the count of certain payments.
3.  `PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`: We start by accessing the `PaymentsMade` collection and then apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This is the first condition within the `WHERE` clause, filtering for payments made to 'Utility Company'.
5.  `& (ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday')))`: This is the second condition, combined with the first using `&` (AND).

    *   `ISIN(..., ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: This function checks if the extracted day name is present in the tuple `('Saturday', 'Sunday')`, effectively filtering for weekend payments.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**: We calculate the start and end dates of the full ISO week (Monday to Sunday) that occurred before the current week.
    *   The start of the previous ISO week is 7 days before the start of the current ISO week.
    *   The end of the previous ISO week is 1 day before the start of the current ISO week (i.e., the Sunday immediately preceding the current week's Monday).
2.  **Filter Payments**: We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Grouping**: For each filtered payment, we extract the date part (truncating any time component) from the `payment_date` field. This ensures that all payments on the same day are grouped together, regardless of the time they were recorded.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: We then partition these payments based on the extracted `day_of_payment` and the `payment_method`.
5.  **Calculate Daily Totals**: Within each partition (i.e., for each day and payment method combination), we sum the `payment_amount` to get the total amount received.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then processes each of these filtered sales to derive new fields:
        *   `c_state = customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
        *   `s_price = sale_price`: Makes the sale price available for later aggregation.
        *   `s_month = MONTH(sale_date)`: Extracts the month from the sale date.
        *   `s_year_start_date = DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of year')`: Calculates the first day of the year for the `sale_date` (e.g., if `sale_date` is '2023-05-15', this becomes '2023-01-01').
        *   `q_start_date = IFF(...)`: This nested `IFF` structure determines the first date of the quarter:
            *   If `s_month` is 1, 2, or 3 (Q1), `q_start_date` is set to `s_year_start_date` (e.g., '2023-01-01').
            *   If `s_month` is 4, 5, or 6 (Q2), `q_start_date` is `s_year_start_date` plus 3 months (e.g., '2023-04-01').
            *   If `s_month` is 7, 8, or 9 (Q3), `q_start_date` is `s_year_start_date` plus 6 months (e.g., '2023-07-01').
            *   If `s_month` is 10, 11, or 12 (Q4), `q_start_date` is `s_year_start_date` plus 9 months (e.g., '2023-10-01').

2.  `quarterly_sales_by_state_result = sales_info_2023.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `sales_info_2023` collection (which contains sales from 2023 with the added quarter information).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`: Groups the records in `sales_info_2023` based on unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, this calculates:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: The state for the group.
        *   `quarter_represented_as = q_start_date`: The quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_quarterly_sales = SUM(s_price)`: The sum of `s_price` (sale prices) for all sales records belonging to that specific state and quarter group.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(customer_state.ASC(), quarter_represented_as.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by customer state in ascending order, and then by the quarter start date in ascending order. This ensures a consistent and readable output.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code aims to identify cars that were in inventory during the latest snapshot taken in March 2023.

1.  **`march_2023_snapshots = InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...)`**:
    This line filters the `InventorySnapshots` collection to include only those records where the `snapshot_date` falls within March 2023. It checks that the year of `snapshot_date` is 2023 and the month is 3 (March).

2.  **`latest_snapshots_in_march = march_2023_snapshots.WHERE(...)`**:
    From the snapshots taken in March 2023, this step identifies those that occurred on the latest date.
    The `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), allow_ties=True) == 1` function is used:
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: Ranks the snapshots in descending order of their `snapshot_date`, so the latest date gets rank 1.
    *   `allow_ties=True`: Ensures that if multiple snapshots were taken on the same latest date, all of them are ranked as 1.
    *   `== 1`: Filters to keep only those snapshots with rank 1 (i.e., taken on the latest date in March 2023).

3.  **`cars_in_inventory_on_latest_snapshot_date = latest_snapshots_in_march.WHERE(...)`**:
    This line further filters the snapshots from the latest date in March 2023 to include only those where the `is_in_inventory` field is `True`. This condition signifies that the car associated with the snapshot was indeed in inventory.

4.  **`result = cars_in_inventory_on_latest_snapshot_date.car.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `cars_in_inventory_on_latest_snapshot_date.car`: For each filtered snapshot record, this accesses the related `Car` object through the `car` relationship.
    *   `.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`: Finally, for each of these cars, it selects and renames the required fields:
        *   `_id` of the car is selected as `car_id`.
        *   `make` of the car is selected as `car_make`.
        *   `model` of the car is selected as `car_model`.
        *   `year` of the car is selected as `car_year`.

The `result` variable will hold a collection of these car details. If no cars meet all the criteria (e.g., no snapshots in March 2023, or no cars in inventory on the latest snapshot date), the `result` will be an empty collection.",34.082635164260864,"# Filter InventorySnapshots for March 2023

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection, as we need to calculate a value for each drug.
2.  For each drug, we will calculate its `avg_ddd_value`. This involves:
    a.  Accessing the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for the current drug.
    b.  Filtering these treatments to include only those where `end_dt` is not null, as specified in the DDD definition.
    c.  For the remaining treatments, calculate the `treatment_duration_days` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`.
    d.  Further filter these treatments to include only those where `treatment_duration_days` is greater than 0. This ensures the treatment had a positive duration and avoids division by zero when calculating DDD.
    e.  For each valid treatment, calculate its individual DDD value using the formula: `ddd_for_this_treatment = tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    f.  The `AVG` aggregation function is then used on the collection of these `ddd_for_this_treatment` values to compute the average DDD for the current drug.
3.  The final result will include the `drug_name` and the calculated `avg_ddd_value`.

        ).ddd_for_this_treatment  # Project the calculated DDDs for AVG function
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code starts by iterating through each record in the `Drugs` collection.

For each drug:
-   It selects the `drug_name`.
-   It calculates `avg_ddd_value` using the `AVG` aggregation function. The input to `AVG` is a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`).
-   The process to get these individual DDD values is as follows:
    1.  `treatments_used_in.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments to only include those where `end_dt` is present (not null).
    2.  `.CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For these filtered treatments, it calculates the duration in days between `start_dt` and `end_dt`.
    3.  `.WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`: It further filters the treatments to ensure the calculated `treatment_duration_days` is positive, preventing division by zero and ensuring meaningful DDDs.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment=tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days)`: For treatments that pass both filters, it calculates the DDD using the formula `tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    5.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values, forming a collection of numbers that `AVG` can then average.

The final output `drug_avg_ddd` will contain each drug's name and its corresponding average DDD. If a drug has no valid treatments to calculate DDD (e.g., all treatments have null `end_dt` or zero/negative duration), its `avg_ddd_value` will typically be null.",41.376975297927856,"drug_avg_ddd = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   We first establish the time window of interest: the last three full months, excluding the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt` marks the end of our window (exclusive).
    *   `three_months_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of our window (inclusive). These are calculated dynamically using `DATETIME('now', ...)` relative to the current date.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_in_period`)**:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the defined three-month window.
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered treatments:
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" is created from `start_dt` (e.g., ""2023-09"") to serve as a key for grouping treatments by month. `LPAD` ensures months are two digits (e.g., ""09"" instead of ""9"") for correct sorting.
        *   `p_id`: The `patient_id` is extracted.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment_flag`: A boolean flag is set to `True` if the treatment's associated drug (`drug.drug_type`) is 'biologic', and `False` otherwise.

3.  **Partition by Month and Aggregate (`monthly_aggregated_data`)**:
    *   The `treatments_in_period` data is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""treatments_per_month"", by=(treatment_month_year_key))`. This groups all treatments by their `treatment_month_year_key`.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes the required aggregates:
        *   `month_label`: This is the `treatment_month_year_key` (e.g., ""2023-09""), representing the month for which the counts are calculated.
        *   `distinct_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.p_id)` counts the number of unique patient IDs within that month's group. This gives the total number of distinct patients who received any treatment in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment_flag == True).p_id)` first filters the treatments within the monthly group to include only those where `is_biologic_treatment_flag` is `True`. Then, it counts the number of unique patient IDs from this subset. This gives the number of distinct patients who received at least one biologic drug treatment in that month.

4.  **Order Results (`result`)**:
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(month_label.ASC())` sorts the aggregated results chronologically by month.

The query will output three rows (one for each of the last three relevant months), each containing the month, the total count of distinct patients treated in that month, and the count of distinct patients who received biologic drug treatments in that month.",51.8127167224884,"# Define date boundaries for the last 3 months, excluding the current month

1.  **Calculate Metrics per Doctor**: For each doctor, we first calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by accessing the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection, then the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the distinct drug identifiers (`drug_id`). This result is stored in an intermediate collection `doctor_metrics`.

2.  **Partition Doctors by Specialty**: We then partition the `doctor_metrics` collection by the `speciality` field. This groups doctors based on their specialty. Each group (partition) is named `specialty_group`.

3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**: For each `specialty_group` (i.e., for each specialty), we access the `Doctors` records belonging to that group. For these doctors, we then:
    *   Select the required fields: `doc_id` and `speciality`.
    *   Use the previously calculated count of distinct drugs, renaming it to `number_of_distinct_drugs` for the final output.
    *   Calculate `SDRSDR` (Specialty Drug Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `by` the number of distinct drugs in descending order (so more drugs mean a better/lower rank number, e.g., rank 1) and `per=""specialty_group""` ensures the rank is calculated independently within each specialty.

This approach ensures that each doctor's rank is relative to other doctors within the same specialty.

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**: For each record in the `Treatments` collection, we calculate two helper fields:
    *   `treatment_month_start_dt_val`: The start date of the month in which the treatment began. This is achieved by truncating the `start_dt` to the beginning of its month. This field will be used for filtering.
    *   `treatment_year_month_str_val`: A string representation of the year and month of the treatment (e.g., ""2023-09""). This is created by combining the year and the zero-padded month from `start_dt`. This string will be used for grouping the treatments by month. The `LPAD` function is used to ensure months are two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January) for correct sorting.

2.  **Filter for Relevant Period**: We filter the treatments to include only those that occurred in the last 12 full months, excluding the current month. This means:
    *   The `treatment_month_start_dt_val` must be on or after the start of the month that was 12 months before the start of the current month.
    *   The `treatment_month_start_dt_val` must be before the start of the current month.
    For example, if the current date is October 15, 2023, the current month starts on October 1, 2023. Twelve months prior to this is October 1, 2022. The filter will include treatments from October 1, 2022, up to (but not including) October 1, 2023, effectively covering months from October 2022 to September 2023.

3.  **Group by Month and Calculate Metrics**: The filtered treatments are then partitioned (grouped) by the `treatment_year_month_str_val`. For each monthly group:
    *   `month`: This is the year-month string (e.g., ""2023-09"").
    *   `PMPD` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id` values from the `Treatments` records within that month's group. This counts how many unique patients received a diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
    *   `PMTC` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated as the total count of `Treatments` records within that month's group.

1.  **Identify New Patients and Their First Treatment Year**: A new patient is defined as a patient starting their first treatment. For each patient who has received at least one treatment, we find the year of their earliest treatment. This year marks when they became a ""new patient"".
2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: We group the patients by their first treatment year and count the number of unique patients in each year. This gives us the `num_new_patients` for each year.
3.  **Calculate NPI**: After ordering the yearly counts by year, we calculate the NPI (New Patients Increase) as the difference between the number of new patients in the current year and the number of new patients in the previous year. For the earliest year in the data, the NPI will be null as there's no preceding year for comparison.

Here's the PyDough code:

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`:
    *   `Patients.WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`: Filters the `Patients` collection to include only those who have at least one treatment record in their `treatments_received` sub-collection.
    *   `.CALCULATE(first_treatment_start_year = YEAR(MIN(treatments_received.start_dt)))`: For each of these patients, it calculates `first_treatment_start_year`. This is done by finding the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` from all their treatments and then extracting the `YEAR` from that date. Each patient will appear once with the year they became a ""new patient"".

2.  `yearly_new_patients_counts`:
    *   `patient_first_treatment_info.PARTITION(name=""year_group"", by=(first_treatment_start_year))`: Takes the previous result and partitions it by `first_treatment_start_year`. This groups all patients who became ""new"" in the same year.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year = first_treatment_start_year, num_new_patients = COUNT(Patients))`: For each year group, it calculates:
        *   `year`: The year itself (from `first_treatment_start_year`).
        *   `num_new_patients`: The count of patients within that group. Since `patient_first_treatment_info` had unique patients, `COUNT(Patients)` correctly gives the number of new patients for that year.

3.  `npi_per_year`:
    *   `yearly_new_patients_counts.ORDER_BY(year.ASC())`: Sorts the yearly new patient counts in ascending order by year. This is necessary for the `PREV` function to work correctly.
    *   `.CALCULATE(year = year, num_new_patients = num_new_patients, NPI = num_new_patients - PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC()))`:
        *   Selects the `year` and `num_new_patients`.
        *   Calculates `NPI` (New Patients Increase). `PREV(num_new_patients, by=year.ASC())` fetches the `num_new_patients` from the immediately preceding row (i.e., the previous year, due to the ordering). The NPI is the current year's count minus the previous year's count. If there is no previous year (i.e., for the first year in the dataset), `PREV` returns `None`, and thus `NPI` will also be `None`.",48.3666570186615,"# Step 1: For each patient with treatments, find the year of their first treatment.

1.  **Filter Relevant Outcomes**: We first identify the outcome records that have non-null PASI scores for both day 7 (`day7_pasi_score`) and day 100 (`day100_pasi_score`). This is crucial because the D7D100PIR calculation relies on both these values. We use `HAS(field_name) == 1` to check for non-null values.
2.  **Calculate Global Average PASI Scores**:
    *   Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` across all the filtered outcome records.
    *   Compute the average `day100_pasi_score` across all the filtered outcome records.
    These calculations are performed at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level to get overall averages.
3.  **Apply the D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the calculated global averages in the provided formula:
    `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
    Multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and maintains floating-point precision.
4.  **Return the Percentage Value**: The final result should be a single percentage value representing the overall D7D100PIR.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_pasi_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE((HAS(day7_pasi_score) == 1) & (HAS(day100_pasi_score) == 1))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Outcomes` collection.
    *   It filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. The `HAS(field_name) == 1` condition checks for non-null values.
    *   The resulting collection, `valid_pasi_outcomes`, contains all outcome records suitable for the D7D100PIR calculation.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts a calculation at the `DermTreatment` (the top-level graph) context. This is appropriate for calculating global aggregates.
    *   `avg_overall_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_pasi_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_pasi_outcomes` collection.
    *   `avg_overall_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_pasi_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_pasi_outcomes` collection.

3.  `.CALCULATE(d7d100pir_percentage = ...)`:
    *   This subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on the results of the previous one (i.e., `avg_overall_day7_pasi` and `avg_overall_day100_pasi`).
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = (avg_overall_day100_pasi - avg_overall_day7_pasi) / avg_overall_day7_pasi * 100.0`: This applies the D7D100PIR formula. The division by `avg_overall_day7_pasi` and multiplication by `100.0` (to ensure floating-point arithmetic) yields the final percentage.

It also requires the count of distinct patients for each of these insurance types.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Filters treatments to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`.
    *   It also ensures that these treatments have associated outcome records using `HAS(outcome_records) == 1`, as PASI scores are derived from outcomes.
    *   A new field, `p_ins_type`, is calculated, storing the `ins_type` (insurance type) of the patient associated with each treatment. This field will be used for grouping.

2.  **Group by Insurance Type and Calculate Metrics**:
    *   The filtered treatment data (`treatments_base_data`) is then partitioned by `p_ins_type` (patient's insurance type). Each partition (`insurance_partition`) represents a unique insurance type.
    *   Within each partition (i.e., for each insurance type), the following metrics are calculated:
        *   `insurance_type`: The insurance type itself (derived from the partition key `p_ins_type`).
        *   `average_pasi_score_at_day_100`: This is the average of `day100_pasi_score` from all `outcome_records` linked to the treatments within that specific insurance type group.
        *   `number_of_distinct_patients`: This counts the unique `patient_id`s associated with the treatments in that insurance type group, effectively giving the number of distinct patients.

3.  **Select Top 5 Insurance Types**:
    *   Finally, the `TOP_K` function is applied to the grouped results (`grouped_by_insurance`).
    *   It selects the top 5 insurance types.
    *   The sorting is done by `average_pasi_score_at_day_100` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so insurance types with the lowest average PASI scores appear first.

The final `result` will contain these top 5 insurance types along with their calculated average PASI score at day 100 and the count of distinct patients.

This is crucial for calculations involving outcome data like `day100_itch_vas`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new fields for each diagnosis:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Selects the name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `Patients` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the patients into groups based on their `ins_type`. Each group will represent a unique insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
        *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` and name it `insurance_type`.
        *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that insurance type group.
        *   `avg_weight_kg=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: We calculate the average `weight_kg` for all patients within that insurance type group.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm.DESC())`**:
    *   Finally, we take the results from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of insurance types with their average heights and weights).
    *   We select the `TOP_K` 3 records, ordering them by `avg_height_cm` in descending order (`DESC()`), so the insurance type with the highest average patient height comes first.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, calculate:
    *   `drug_name_val`: The name of the drug, derived from the `drug_name` field.
    *   `num_treatments_val`: The total number of treatments associated with the drug. This is obtained by counting the records in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
    *   `avg_drug_amount_val`: The average total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) across all treatments associated with the drug. This is calculated using the `AVG` aggregation function on `treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments_val.DESC())` function to select the 5 drugs that have the highest number of treatments. The sorting is done in descending order of `num_treatments_val`.
4.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` operation to select and rename the fields for the output:
    *   `drug_name`: The name of the drug.
    *   `num_treatments`: The total number of treatments for that drug.
    *   `average_drug_amount`: The calculated average drug amount per treatment for that drug.

This approach prioritizes drugs by the number of treatments for the ""top 5"" selection, as it's the first criterion mentioned and `TOP_K`'s `by` parameter in the reference typically takes a single expression.

1.  Define the date range: Calculate ""6 months ago from today"" and ""today"" using the `DATETIME` function.
2.  Filter the `Treatments` collection based on three conditions combined with an AND (`&`) operator:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` must contain 'psoriasis'. This is achieved by converting the `diag_name` to lowercase using `LOWER()` and then using the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'%psoriasis%'` for a case-insensitive wildcard match.
    *   **Drug Approval Condition**: The `drug` used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. This is checked by verifying that the `fda_appr_dt` field in the associated `drug` record exists (is not null) using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The `end_dt` of the treatment must be within the last 6 months from today. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to ""6 months ago"" and less than or equal to ""today"".
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions using the `COUNT()` aggregation function.

    *   `.SINGULAR()` is then used to ensure that we are referencing a single treatment record. If a doctor has no treatments, or if the ranking somehow doesn't yield a single record (which `allow_ties=False` helps prevent), fields accessed from `first_treatment_for_doctor` will be null.
4.  Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to select the doctor's `last_name`, `year_reg`, and from the identified first treatment, its `start_dt` and `treatment_id`. The problem asks for ""treatment _id"", and `treatment_id` is the relevant identifier in the `Treatments` collection.

5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).

Explanation:
1.  `Patients.WHERE((gender == ""Male"") & (ins_type == ""Private""))`: This part filters the `Patients` collection to select only those patients who are male and have 'Private' insurance.
2.  `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years = DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age. `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current date/time.

"Calculate the CPUR for each merchant, considering only successful transactions.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we need to calculate two values based on their `transactions_received`:
    *   `distinct_coupons_used_count`: The number of unique coupons used in transactions that were 'successful' and had a coupon associated. This is found by taking `transactions_received`, filtering them by `status == ""successful""` and where `coupon_id` is present, and then counting the number of distinct `coupon_id`s.
    *   `distinct_successful_transactions_count`: The total number of 'successful' transactions. This is found by taking `transactions_received`, filtering them by `status == ""successful""`, and then counting these transactions.
3.  Calculate CPUR using the formula: `CPUR = distinct_coupons_used_count / distinct_successful_transactions_count`.
4.  To handle cases where a merchant might have zero successful transactions (to prevent division by zero), we use the `IFF` function. If there are no successful transactions, CPUR will be 0.0.
5.  The final result will include the `merchant_name` and the calculated `CPUR`.

We will use two `CALCULATE` steps: the first to compute the counts, and the second to compute the CPUR and select the final fields.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate intermediate counts for distinct coupons and successful transactions per merchant.
merchant_transaction_stats = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    # Store merchant name for final output

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: We select the merchant's name and store it temporarily.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used_count=NDISTINCT(...)`:
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon_id) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were successful and where a coupon was used (i.e., `coupon_id` is present).
        *   `.coupon_id`: We then look at the `coupon_id` of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: This counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions.
    *   `distinct_successful_transactions_count=COUNT(...)`:
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were successful.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of such successful transactions.
2.  `merchant_transaction_stats.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` step uses the results from the first one.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: We rename `merchant_name_val` to `merchant_name` for the final output.
    *   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: This calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `distinct_successful_transactions_count > 0`: This is the condition for the `IFF` function. It checks if there were any successful transactions.
        *   `distinct_coupons_used_count / distinct_successful_transactions_count`: If the condition is true (there were successful transactions), CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the count of distinct successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If the condition is false (no successful transactions), CPUR is set to 0.0 to avoid division by zero and provide a float output.

    *   Flag if the notification was sent on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `is_weekend_notification_flag`.
    *   Calculate how many full weeks ago this notification's week was compared to the `current_week_start_ts` (`num_weeks_ago`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_context`: We start by calculating `current_week_start_ts` (the timestamp for the beginning of the current week) at the `Ewallet` (graph) level. This provides a stable reference for date calculations.
2.  `notifications_with_week_info`:
    *   We access `Users` and filter for those in the ""US"" or ""CA"".
    *   Then, we access their `notifications`.
    *   For each notification, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start date of the week the notification was created, effectively truncating `created_at` to the week.
        *   `is_weekend_notification_flag`: A flag (1 if true, 0 if false) indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME()`.
        *   `num_weeks_ago`: The difference in full weeks between the notification's week and the `current_week_start_ts`.
3.  `relevant_notifications_for_period`: We filter the above results to keep only notifications where `num_weeks_ago` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_notification_summary` (assigned to `result`):
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_notifications_for_period` by `notification_actual_week_start`. This groups notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for which the counts are being reported.
        *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications sent in that week (achieved by `COUNT(Notifications)` within the partition group).
        *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications sent on a weekend during that week (achieved by `SUM(is_weekend_notification_flag)` over the items in the partition group).

"What is the average AMB for user wallets updated in the past week, inclusive of 7 days ago? Return the average balance.AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)","SELECT AVG(balance) AS AMB FROM wallet_user_balance_daily WHERE updated_at >= DATE('now', '-7 days');",Ewallet,"The query aims to calculate the average AMB (Average Balance per User) for user wallets that were updated within the last 7 days, inclusive of today and 7 days ago. The AMB itself is defined as the average balance for a specific user over this time duration. The final result should be the average of these individual user AMBs.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter Relevant User Balances**: It first filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` falls within the period from 7 days ago up to and including the current moment. The `DATEDIFF` function is used to determine this:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) >= 0` ensures the update was not in the future.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` ensures the update occurred today or within the preceding 7 days. This covers an 8-day span (e.g., if today is the 8th, it includes updates from the 1st to the 8th).

2.  **Calculate AMB per User**:
    *   The filtered balances are then partitioned by `user_id`. This groups all relevant balance entries for each unique user.
    *   For each user's group of balances, `CALCULATE` is used to compute their average balance (`AVG(UserBalances.balance)`). This result is named `amb_value` and represents the AMB for that specific user over the defined period.

3.  **Calculate Overall Average AMB**:
    *   Finally, the code calculates the average of all the `amb_value`s obtained in the previous step. This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `amb_value` column of the `user_amb_for_week` collection.
    *   The result is a single value representing the average AMB across all users who had balance updates in the specified timeframe.

```python
# Filter UserBalances for entries updated from 7 days ago up to and including today.
# DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) calculates the number of full days between updated_at and now.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Access Merchants**: We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  **Calculate Revenue**: For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue.
    *   This involves accessing their `transactions_received`.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those that were `successfully received`. This means the transaction `status` must be 'completed'.
    *   Additionally, the problem specifies to filter for `receiver_type=1` for merchants. So, we add this condition to the transaction filter.
    *   We then `SUM` the `amount` of these filtered transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant.
3.  **Rank Merchants**: After calculating the revenue for all merchants, we rank them.
    *   The ranking is based on the calculated revenue, in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).
4.  **Select Output Fields**: Finally, we select the merchant's name, category, their calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate revenue for each merchant from their successfully received transactions.
# We filter transactions by status 'completed' and receiver_type 1.
merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `merch_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name and renames it to `merch_name`.
    *   `merch_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category and renames it to `merch_category`.
    *   `revenue_value=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   This calculates the total revenue for each merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is 'completed' (indicating a successful transaction) AND `receiver_type` is 1 (as specified for merchants).
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Sums up these amounts to get the total `revenue_value` for the merchant.

2.  `mrr_calculation = merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the result from the previous step (`merchant_revenues_calc`).
    *   `merchant_name=merch_name`: Selects the previously calculated `merch_name`.
    *   `category=merch_category`: Selects the previously calculated `merch_category`.
    *   `revenue_amount=revenue_value`: Selects the calculated `revenue_value` and renames it to `revenue_amount` for the final output.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_value.DESC())`:
        *   This calculates the rank for each merchant based on their `revenue_value`.
        *   `by=revenue_value.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be done on the `revenue_value` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

Truncate created_at to month for aggregation.,"SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', t.created_at) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS active_users FROM wallet_transactions_daily AS t WHERE t.sender_type = 0 AND t.created_at >= date('now', 'start of month', '-2 months') AND t.created_at < date('now', 'start of month') GROUP BY month;",Ewallet,"The query calculates the Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU) based on the provided definition: ""distinct sender with sender_type = 0. Truncate created_at to month for aggregation"". This means for each of the last two months (excluding the current month), we count the number of unique senders who made a transaction of `sender_type = 0`.

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   We first calculate the start date of the current month and the start date of two months prior to the current month. This is done using `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to create global constants accessible later.
    *   `calc_current_month_start`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `calc_two_months_ago_start`: The first day of the month that was two months ago.
    *   The period of interest for transactions will be from `calc_two_months_ago_start` (inclusive) up to `calc_current_month_start` (exclusive).

2.  **Filter Transactions**:
    *   We access `Transactions` via the `date_info` collection (which contains our calculated dates).
    *   Transactions are filtered to include only those where:
        *   `sender_type == 0`.
        *   `created_at` is within the last two full months (i.e., `created_at >= calc_two_months_ago_start` and `created_at < calc_current_month_start`).
    *   We use `date_info.SINGULAR().<field_name>` to refer to the calculated date boundaries from the single-row `date_info` collection.

3.  **Prepare for Monthly Aggregation**:
    *   For each filtered transaction, we extract the `year` and `month` from its `created_at` timestamp. These will be used as keys for partitioning.
    *   The `sender_id` is also selected to be available for the distinct count.

4.  **Calculate PMDAU per Month**:
    *   The transactions (now with `tx_year` and `tx_month`) are partitioned by `tx_year` and `tx_month`. This groups all relevant transactions by the month they occurred in.
    *   For each monthly group, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `year`: The year of the group.
        *   `month`: The month of the group.
        *   `pmdau`: The number of distinct `sender_id` values within that month's transactions, calculated using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.sender_id)`. This directly implements the provided definition of PMDAU.

5.  **Order Results**:
    *   The final results are ordered by year and then by month in ascending order.

This PyDough code performs the following actions:
1.  `sessions_in_range_with_duration`: This variable holds sessions from the `UserSessions` collection that fall within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). For each such session, it calculates the `duration_in_seconds` using `DATEDIFF` and retains the `user_id`.
2.  `user_aggregated_durations`: This takes the intermediate result and partitions it by `user_id`. For each `user_id` group, it calculates the `total_duration_seconds` by summing up the `duration_in_seconds` of all sessions belonging to that user within the filtered range. The output of this step contains `user_id` and their corresponding `total_duration_seconds`.
3.  `result`: Finally, this sorts the `user_aggregated_durations` by the `total_duration_seconds` field in descending order, so users with the longest total session durations appear first.

3.  Count the total number of these filtered transactions.
4.  Count how many of these transactions were ""successful"". We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` field is ""completed"".
5.  Calculate STR using the formula: `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `prev_month_start_boundary` and `current_month_start_boundary`: These contextless expressions define the time window for the ""previous month"". `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 months')` calculates the start of the month preceding the current one. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gives the start of the current month. Transactions are included if their `created_at` timestamp is on or after `prev_month_start_boundary` and before `current_month_start_boundary`.
2.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: The calculation is performed at the top `Ewallet` graph level because STR is a single aggregate metric for all relevant transactions.
3.  `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: This counts transactions that meet three criteria:
    *   Their `created_at` date falls within the previously defined previous month.
    *   Their `status` is ""completed"" (this is an assumption for what constitutes a successful transaction, as ""successful"" status values are not explicitly defined in the schema).
4.  `num_total_tx_prev_month`: This counts all transactions whose `created_at` date falls within the previous month, regardless of their status.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` computes `calculated_previous_month_str`:
    *   It uses an `IFF` condition to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than 0. This prevents division by zero errors if no transactions occurred in the previous month.
    *   If there were transactions, STR is calculated as `(num_successful_tx_prev_month / num_total_tx_prev_month) * 100.0` to express it as a percentage.
    *   If there were no transactions, STR is set to `0.0`.
6.  `result = str_calculation.CALCULATE(previous_month_str = calculated_previous_month_str)`: The final step selects only the `calculated_previous_month_str` and assigns it to the field `previous_month_str`, ensuring the output contains only the requested STR value.",46.53062868118286,"# Define the date boundaries for the previous month.

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).

For these top countries, we need to return the country name, the number of distinct users who initiated these transactions, and the total transaction amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters transactions to include only those where `sender_type == 0` (indicating the sender is a user).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it uses `CALCULATE` to create a new temporary collection `transaction_details`. This collection includes:
        *   `tx_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
        *   `user_country`: The `country` of the `sending_user`.
        *   `sender_user_id`: The `uid` of the `sending_user`, which will be used to count distinct users.

2.  **Group by Country**:
    *   The `transaction_details` collection is then partitioned by `user_country`. This groups all transaction details by the country of the sending user. Each group is named `country_transactions_group`.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates per Country**:
    *   For each `country_transactions_group` (i.e., for each country), it calculates:
        *   `country`: The name of the country (from `user_country`).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct sending users within that country, calculated using `NDISTINCT` on `sender_user_id` from the `country_transactions_group`.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all `tx_amount` within that country, calculated using `SUM` on `tx_amount` from the `country_transactions_group`.
    *   This results in the `country_summary` collection.

4.  **Select Top 5 Countries**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `country_summary` collection to select the top 5 countries with the highest `total_transaction_amount`.

The resulting collection will contain the `country`, `num_distinct_users`, and `total_transaction_amount` for these top 5 countries.

5.  Use the `TOP_K(2, by=val_total_transaction_amount.DESC())` function to select the top 2 merchants based on the `val_total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection. We apply two filters:
    *   The merchant's `status` must be 'active'.
    *   The merchant's `category` (converted to lowercase) must contain the substring 'retail'. This ensures case-insensitive matching for the category.
2.  **Access Balances**: For these filtered merchants, we access their associated balance records through the `balances` sub-collection. This gives us a collection of `MerchantBalances` records.
3.  **Filter Balances by Update Date**: We then filter these `MerchantBalances` records to include only those that were `updated_at` today. This is done by comparing the date part of `updated_at` (truncated to the start of the day) with the current date (also truncated to the start of the day).
4.  **Calculate Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the `MEDIAN` of the `balance` field from these filtered, today-updated balance records. This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single result representing the overall median.

```python
# Filter merchants who are active and have 'retail' in their category
active_retail_merchants = Merchants.WHERE(
    (status == 'active') & CONTAINS(LOWER(category), 'retail')

# Access the balance records for these merchants

1.  Filter the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only snapshots taken in the year 2023.
2.  For these 2023 snapshots, calculate a rank based on their `snapshot_date`. The ranking should be in ascending order (earliest first) and allow ties, so all snapshots sharing the earliest date get the same rank. We also select the `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` values.
3.  Filter these ranked snapshots to keep only those with rank 1, which correspond to the earliest snapshot(s) in 2023.
4.  Finally, calculate the average of `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` from this group of earliest snapshots. This will result in a single row containing the two average values.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only records where the `snapshot_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered 2023 snapshots.
    *   `tx_limit_daily_val = tx_limit_daily`, `tx_limit_monthly_val = tx_limit_monthly`: These expressions select the daily and monthly transaction limits, assigning them to new field names for clarity or further use.
    *   `date_rank = RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates a rank for each snapshot within the 2023 set. `by=snapshot_date.ASC()` orders them from earliest to latest. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest `snapshot_date`, they all receive rank 1.
3.  `snapshots_2023_ranked.WHERE(date_rank == 1)`: This filters the ranked snapshots, keeping only those that have `date_rank` equal to 1. These are the earliest snapshots from 2023.
4.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation is performed at the top `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single row of results.
    *   `average_tx_limit_daily = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_daily_val)`: This computes the average of the `tx_limit_daily_val` from all the snapshots identified as ""earliest"" in 2023.
    *   `average_tx_limit_monthly = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_monthly_val)`: Similarly, this computes the average of the `tx_limit_monthly_val` for the same set of earliest snapshots.

result = average_duration_by_device
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)` calculates the difference between the session start and end timestamps in seconds for each session, naming this new field `duration_seconds`.
    *   `device_type = device_type` ensures the `device_type` field is available from the `UserSessions` collection for the subsequent partitioning step.

2.  `average_duration_by_device = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""device_type_groups"", by=(device_type))`: This partitions the `sessions_with_duration` data into groups based on unique values of `device_type`. Each group is internally referred to as `device_type_groups`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type = device_type, avg_session_duration_in_seconds = AVG(device_type_groups.duration_seconds))`: For each partition (i.e., for each `device_type`):

        *   `avg_session_duration_in_seconds = AVG(device_type_groups.duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_seconds` field (which was computed in the first step) for all sessions within the current `device_type_groups` partition.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection and filter for those who have at least one coupon using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
2.  For each of these merchants, we need to find their registration date (`created_at`) and identify their earliest coupon. The earliest coupon can be found by taking their `coupons` sub-collection, ordering it by `start_date` in ascending order, and selecting the top one using `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`. We then use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this single coupon record as directly accessible. This information is captured in a `CALCULATE` step.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, we extract the `cid` (coupon ID) and `start_date` from the earliest coupon record obtained in the previous step.
4.  We then filter these merchants using a `WHERE` clause. The condition is that the earliest coupon's `start_date` must be within one year of the merchant's `created_at` (registration date). This is checked by ensuring that the difference in days, calculated by `DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant_registration_date, earliest_coupon_start_date)`, is between 0 and 365, inclusive.
