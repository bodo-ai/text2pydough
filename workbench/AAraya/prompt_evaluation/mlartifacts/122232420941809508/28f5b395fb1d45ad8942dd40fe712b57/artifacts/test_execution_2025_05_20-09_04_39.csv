1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter these customers to include only those who have made at least 5 transactions. This is done by checking `COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5`.
3.  For the filtered customers, calculate their success rate. We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is ""Completed"". The success rate is calculated as: `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`.
4.  Select the customer's name and their calculated success rate.
5.  Order the results by the success rate in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name,
    success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0
).ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers, keeping only those for whom the count of their `transactions_made` (i.e., total transactions) is greater than or equal to 5.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   For each customer passing the filter, we calculate two new fields:
        *   `customer_name=name`: This selects the customer's `name`.
        *   `success_rate=(COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed"")) / COUNT(transactions_made)) * 100.0`:
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))`: This counts the number of transactions for the current customer where the `status` is ""Completed"". This is assumed to be the count of successful transactions.
            *   `COUNT(transactions_made)`: This counts the total number of transactions for the current customer.
            *   The division of these two counts gives the ratio of successful transactions to total transactions.
            *   Multiplying by `100.0` converts this ratio to a percentage.

3.  `.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`:
    *   Finally, the resulting collection (containing `customer_name` and `success_rate`) is sorted by the `success_rate` in ascending order (`.ASC()`), so customers with the lowest success rates appear first.",25.836535215377808,"customer_success_rates = Customers.WHERE(COUNT(transactions_made) >= 5).CALCULATE(

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG tickers. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in combination with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol` within the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering the `Customers` collection directly.
5.  The final result will be a single number, so we'll use `Broker.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')

# Filter customers who:
# 1. Have an email address ending with "".com""
# 2. Have made at least one transaction involving a FAANG stock
filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(

)

# Calculate the count of these distinct customers
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`: This line defines a tuple (which acts like a list in this context) containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression that makes the query cleaner.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Customers` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition. It checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Within the transactions of a customer, this filters for transactions where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` list. `ISIN` checks for membership.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the preceding filtered collection (transactions of FAANG stocks for that customer) has at least one record. If it does, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this comparison).
6.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_customers` contains the collection of customers who meet both criteria.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of records in this `filtered_customers` collection, which gives the number of distinct customers.
    *   `Broker.CALCULATE(...)` is used to create a final result with a single row, assigning the calculated count to the field `count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email`.",31.799378871917725,"# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols

1.  **Filter Stock Transactions and Add Temporal Information**:
    *   Start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, calculate two new fields:
        *   `transaction_week_start_date`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This is derived using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday""), derived using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.

2.  **Define and Filter by Time Window**:
    *   Calculate `current_week_start`: The start date of the current week, using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Calculate `earliest_relevant_week_start`: The start date of the 8th week prior to the current week. This is `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-56 days')` (since 8 weeks = 56 days).
    *   Filter the transactions prepared in Step 1 to include only those where `transaction_week_start_date` is greater than or equal to `earliest_relevant_week_start` AND less than `current_week_start`. This effectively selects transactions from the last 8 full weeks, excluding the current ongoing week.

3.  **Group by Week and Aggregate Counts**:
    *   Partition the filtered transactions from Step 2 by `transaction_week_start_date`. This creates groups, where each group represents a unique week.
    *   For each weekly group, calculate:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (renaming the partition key).
        *   `total_stock_txns`: The total count of stock transactions within that week, using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns`: The count of stock transactions within that week that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Order the final results by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `stock_transactions_with_temporal_info`: This first step filters all `Transactions` to keep only those related to 'Stock' tickers. It then augments each of these transactions with two new calculated fields: `transaction_week_start_date` (which identifies the Monday of the week the transaction occurred) and `day_name_of_transaction` (the name of the day, like ""Saturday"").
2.  `transactions_in_relevant_period`:
    *   We use `Broker.CALCULATE` to define two key dates: `def_current_week_start` (the Monday of the current week) and `def_earliest_week_to_include` (the Monday of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week).
    *   It then takes the `stock_transactions_with_temporal_info` and filters them to include only transactions whose `transaction_week_start_date` falls within the range `[def_earliest_week_to_include, def_current_week_start)`. This selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   This step takes the `transactions_in_relevant_period` and partitions them using `transaction_week_start_date` as the key. This means all transactions that fall into the same week (based on their calculated `transaction_week_start_date`) are grouped together.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), it calculates:
        *   `week_start_date_output`: The start date of that specific week.
        *   `total_stock_txns_for_week`: The total number of stock transactions that occurred in that week.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns_for_week`: The number of stock transactions from that week that occurred on either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", using the `day_name_of_transaction` field calculated earlier.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date_output` in descending order, so the most recent of the 8 weeks appears first.",44.64800810813904,"# Step 1: Filter stock transactions and add week and day name information

These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions_last_week_usa)`: Counts the number of records in the `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa` collection.

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those with `transaction_type` as ""BUY"".
2.  Further filter these transactions to include only those that occurred within the last 10 days. This is achieved by comparing the `date_time` of the transaction with the current date using `DATEDIFF` and `DATETIME('now')`.
3.  For these filtered transactions, we extract the `ticker.symbol`. We use `CALCULATE` to make this symbol available as a field.
4.  We then `PARTITION` these transactions by the extracted `transaction_ticker_symbol`.
5.  Within each partition (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol), we `CALCULATE` the ticker symbol and count the number of transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined 6-month window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month and Year**: For these filtered customers, we extract the year and month of their `join_date`.

5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month-year group, we count the number of customers.
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month-year group, we calculate the average `amount` from all transactions made by the customers in that group. If a group has no transactions, PMAT will default to 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_boundary` and `six_months_ago_start_boundary` define the date range for customer signups. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gets the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` gets the first day of the month that was six months ago.
2.  `Customers.WHERE(...)` filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is within the last six full months (e.g., if today is July 15th, this includes customers who joined from January 1st up to, but not including, July 1st).
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))` extracts the year and month from the `join_date` for these customers.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_signup_cohorts"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))` groups these customers by the year and month they signed up.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the requested metrics for each group:
    *   `signup_month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", signup_year_val, LPAD(signup_month_val, 2, ""0""))`: Formats the signup year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January).
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers in each `monthly_signup_cohorts` group, giving the Per Month Customer Signups.
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: Calculates the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in each group. `Customers.transactions_made` accesses the related transactions. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, PMAT will be 0.0 instead of null.

The AR is defined as `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Here's how the PyDough code implements this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: It first selects customers who joined in 2022 using `Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`. For each of these customers, it creates a flag `is_active_flag` which is true (1) if the customer has made any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) and false (0) otherwise. This collection is named `filtered_customers`.

2.  **Group by Country and Aggregate**: The `filtered_customers` are then partitioned by their `country` using `PARTITION(name=""country_data"", by=(country))`. For each country group:
    *   `num_active_customers_in_country`: This is calculated by summing the `is_active_flag` for all customers in that country group (`SUM(filtered_customers.is_active_flag)`). This effectively counts customers who joined in 2022, belong to the specific country, and have transactions.
    *   `total_customers_in_country_cohort`: This is the total count of customers within that country group (`COUNT(filtered_customers)`), representing all customers who joined in 2022 and belong to that country.

3.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `activity_ratio_value`.
    *   The AR is `(num_active_customers_in_country * 100.0) / total_customers_in_country_cohort`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country_cohort` might be zero (i.e., no customers joined from that country in 2022) to prevent division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   This interpretation assumes that for the cohort ""customers who joined in 2022"", ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" refers to those in the cohort with transactions, and ""Total Number of Customers"" (in the denominator of the AR formula) refers to all customers in that cohort for the given country.

4.  **Format Final Result**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `country` and `AR` as requested.

1.  Define the start of the ""past month"" period using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
2.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only ""sell"" transactions that occurred on or after this date.
3.  For these filtered transactions, calculate necessary fields: the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction amount (`amount`), and the combined costs (`tax + commission`).
4.  Partition these processed transactions by the ticker symbol.
5.  For each ticker symbol group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_amount_from_sells` by summing the `transaction_amount` for all transactions in that group.
    *   Calculate `total_transaction_costs` by summing the `transaction_costs` for all transactions in that group.
6.  Finally, calculate the SPM using the formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_transaction_costs) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `total_amount_from_sells` is zero to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` for SPM in such instances.

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly one month prior to the current moment. This will be used to filter transactions.
2.  `relevant_transactions_data = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time >= one_month_ago_date))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that are of `transaction_type` ""sell"" AND occurred on or after `one_month_ago_date`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate:
        *   `ticker_symbol_val = ticker.symbol`: Extracts the stock symbol associated with the transaction.
        *   `current_transaction_amount = amount`: Takes the transaction amount.
        *   `current_transaction_costs = tax + commission`: Calculates the sum of tax and commission for the transaction.
3.  `spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker = relevant_transactions_data.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the `relevant_transactions_data` by `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `name=""transactions_for_ticker""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(ticker_symbol_val)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol_output = ticker_symbol_val`: Carries over the ticker symbol.
        *   `total_sells_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_amount)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_amount` values for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
        *   `total_costs_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_costs)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_costs` for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
4.  `result = spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the SPM for each ticker.
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_output`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `SPM = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin.
        *   `IFF(total_sells_for_ticker == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This checks if `total_sells_for_ticker` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   `(total_sells_for_ticker - total_costs_for_ticker) / total_sells_for_ticker * 100.0`: If `total_sells_for_ticker` is not zero, this calculates the SPM according to the provided formula. The `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

1.  **Augment Daily Prices**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each daily price record, retrieve the ticker's symbol and extract the numeric year and month from the date. These numeric date parts are essential for correct chronological sorting later.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Group the augmented daily price data by ticker symbol, year, and month. For each group (i.e., for each ticker for each month), calculate:
    *   Average closing price (`AVG(DailyPrices.close)`)
    *   Highest price (`MAX(DailyPrices.high)`)
    *   Lowest price (`MIN(DailyPrices.low)`)
3.  **Prepare for MoMC Calculation**: Take the result from step 2 (which is a collection of monthly aggregates per ticker). To calculate MoMC, we need the average closing price of the *previous* month for the *same ticker*. We achieve this by:
    *   Partitioning the monthly aggregated data by `ticker_symbol`.
    *   Within each ticker's series of monthly data, use the `PREV` window function. `PREV` will look up the `avg_close_price_monthly` from the preceding record (ordered by year and month) within the same ticker's data. If there's no preceding month (e.g., it's the first month of data for that ticker), `PREV` will return `None`.
4.  **Calculate MoMC and Finalize Output**: With the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where the previous month's average close is `None` or zero to prevent division errors; in such cases, MoMC will be `None`.
    *   Format the month as a 'YYYY-MM' string.
    *   Select the requested fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.
    *   Finally, order the results by ticker symbol, then chronologically by year and month.

3.  Filter these records to include only those within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"" (inclusive).
4.  Partition the filtered data by the calculated ticker symbol. This groups all price records for each distinct stock.
5.  For each stock group (partition), calculate the maximum high price (`period_max_high`) and the minimum low price (`period_min_low`) observed during the specified date range.
6.  Calculate the `price_change_val` for each stock by subtracting `period_min_low` from `period_max_high`.
7.  Use `TOP_K` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest `price_change_val`, ordering in descending order.
8.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to `ticker_symbol` and `price_change` for the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates an operation on the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_id=_id, c_name=name`: We select the customer's `_id` and `name`, renaming them to `c_id` and `c_name` for use in subsequent steps.
    *   `num_join_month_txns=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same month and year as their `join_date`.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions where the month of `date_time` matches the month of `join_date`, AND the year of `date_time` matches the year of `join_date` are considered.

**Explanation:**

*   `Customers`: We start by accessing the `Customers` collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(name=name, total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount))`:
    *   This step calculates new fields for each customer.
    *   `name=name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` field from the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer. `transactions_made` is a list of transactions associated with each customer, and `amount` is a field within each transaction. `SUM()` is an aggregation function that correctly handles this plural sub-collection.
*   `.TOP_K(5, by=total_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This method selects the top 5 records from the result of the preceding `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `5`: Specifies that we want the top 5 customers.
    *   `by=total_amount.DESC()`: Orders the customers by the `total_amount` (calculated in the previous step) in descending order (`DESC()`), so the customers with the highest total transaction amounts are ranked first.

result = type_summary.TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())

**Explanation:**

1.  `dated_transactions`: This variable stores transactions filtered to be within the date range of January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` function ensures that the time component of `date_time` is ignored, making the date comparison accurate for inclusivity.
2.  `type_summary`:
    *   We partition `dated_transactions` by `transaction_type`. This groups all transactions of the same type together.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
        *   `num_distinct_customers`: The count of unique `customer_id`s who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)` achieves this.
        *   `avg_shares`: The average number of `shares` for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG(Transactions.shares)` calculates this.
3.  `result`: This variable takes `type_summary` and applies `TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter DailyPrices for 'VTI' and for the last 7 calendar days (today + 6 previous days)
vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (ticker.symbol == 'VTI') &

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.
        *   `<= 6` ensures the date is within the 6 days prior to today, or is today itself (0 days difference). This covers a total of 7 distinct calendar days.

**Explanation:**

*   `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers who have at least one transaction recorded in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: Selects the customer's `_id`.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: Calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This expression retrieves the date of the customer's first transaction.
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions. The `RANKING` function assigns a rank to each transaction based on its `date_time` (ascending). `per=""Customers""` ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer's set of transactions. We select the transaction(s) with rank 1 (the earliest).
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the previous filtering results in a single transaction record (the first one), allowing direct access to its fields.
            *   `.date_time`: Accesses the `date_time` field of this first transaction.",47.9397714138031,"customer_join_to_first_transaction_diff = Customers.WHERE(

1.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred in January, February, or March of 2023 and had a status of ""successful"".
2.  Extract the month from the `date_time` of these filtered transactions.
3.  Group these transactions by the extracted month.
4.  For each month, calculate the average transaction `price`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures we only consider transactions that were completed successfully.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitute the first quarter.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month_number = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, we create a new field `transaction_month_number` which stores the month of each transaction. The original `price` field from `Transactions` is implicitly available for later aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month_number))`: We then partition the filtered and augmented transactions into groups based on the `transaction_month_number`. Each group will contain all successful transactions for a specific month in Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month_number, average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each partition (i.e., for each month):
    *   `month = transaction_month_number`: We select the month number for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: We calculate the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` of the transactions belonging to the current partition.
5.  `result = monthly_average_transaction_prices`: The final result contains each month of Q1 2023 (as a number 1, 2, or 3) and the calculated average transaction price for successful transactions within that month.",32.907639265060425,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 that were successful

    *   The filtered cars are then partitioned using `.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`.
    *   This groups the cars by unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group in `model_group` represents a distinct car model that met the VIN criteria.

3.  **Calculate Sales per Model**:
    *   Finally, `.CALCULATE(...)` is applied to each group created by the partition.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` of the car model (which is a partitioning key).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` of the car model (also a partitioning key).

        *   `Cars` within this `CALCULATE` refers to the sub-collection of cars belonging to the current (make, model) partition.
        *   `Cars.sale_records` accesses all sale records associated with these cars.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
3.  Further filter these sales to include only those that occurred within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. This is achieved by:
    *   Calculating the difference in days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) using `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))`.
    *   Ensuring this difference is less than or equal to 29. A difference of 0 means the sale was today, and a difference of 29 means the sale was 29 days ago, covering a 30-day period.
    *   Adding a condition `sale_date <= DATETIME('now')` to ensure that only past or current sales are considered, preventing any potential issues if `sale_date` could be in the future.
4.  Use the `Dealership` (top-level) collection's `CALCULATE` method to compute:
    *   `number_of_sales`: The count of the filtered sales records.
    *   `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for these filtered sales.

    number_of_sales = COUNT(toyota_sales_in_last_30_days),
    total_revenue = SUM(toyota_sales_in_last_30_days.sale_price)
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code first creates a temporary collection `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days`. This collection contains records from the `Sales` table that satisfy three conditions:
1.  The `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
2.  The `sale_date` is within the last 30 days, inclusive of today. This is checked by ensuring that the number of full days between the `sale_date` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is 29 or less.
3.  The `sale_date` is not in the future, which is a safeguard.

Then, using the main `Dealership` collection, it calculates two aggregate values from this filtered set:
-   `number_of_sales`: The total count of sales records in `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days`.
-   `total_revenue`: The sum of the `sale_price` for all sales in `toyota_sales_in_last_30_days`.

The final `result` will be a single record containing these two calculated fields.",50.44418668746948,"# Filter sales for Toyota cars made in the last 30 days (inclusive of today)

**Explanation:**

The query starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
-   `sp_first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
-   `sp_last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
-   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made` sub-collection).
-   `calculated_num_sales`: The count of all sales associated with the salesperson.

The second `CALCULATE` then uses these intermediate values to produce the final output:
-   `first_name`: Renamed from `sp_first_name`.
-   `last_name`: Renamed from `sp_last_name`.
-   `total_sales_amount`: Renamed from `calculated_total_sales`.
-   `number_of_sales`: Renamed from `calculated_num_sales`.
-   `SR`: The sales rank, calculated using the `RANKING()` function on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order. This means salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank number.

Finally, `ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())` sorts the resulting list of salespersons by their sales rank in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",45.547791957855225,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_details_with_inventory_status`: We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection. For every sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (`car.make`, `car.model`), the `sale_price` of that transaction, and determine the car's `latest_inventory_status`.
    *   The `latest_inventory_status` is found by looking at the car's `inventory_snapshots`. We select the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`. `SINGULAR()` is used to access the fields of this single snapshot.
    *   `IFF(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots) == 1, ..., True)` handles cases where a car might not have any inventory snapshots. If snapshots exist, we use the latest one; otherwise, we default the status to `True` (in inventory), ensuring these cars are filtered out later.
2.  `sold_cars_not_in_inventory`: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only records where `latest_inventory_status` is `False`, meaning the car has been sold and is confirmed to be out of inventory based on its latest snapshot.
3.  `max_prices_by_make_model`: We then use `PARTITION` to group these filtered sales by `car_make_val` and `car_model_val`. Within each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination), we `CALCULATE` the final output fields:
    *   `make`: The car's make.
    *   `model`: The car's model.
    *   `highest_sale_price`: The maximum `current_sale_price` found among all sales for that specific make and model combination that met the criteria.
4.  `final_result`: Finally, we sort these grouped results using `ORDER_BY` on the `highest_sale_price` in descending order, as requested.",67.32680320739746,"# Step 1: For each sale, get car details (make, model), sale price, and its latest inventory status.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and then filter it.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""NewFord"", ""FordMotors""). `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"", allowing for case-insensitive partial matches.
    *   **`|`**: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains ""ford"" OR its model contains ""mustang"".

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each car that meets the filter criteria, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields directly from the `Cars` collection.
    *   **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car.
        *   `sale_records` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each car.
        *   `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)` computes the average of the `sale_price` from all sale records associated with that car. If a car has no sale records, the `AVG` function will typically result in `null` for `avg_sale_price`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_val` and `end_period_val` define the date range for the last six full months, excluding the current month. For example, if ""now"" is July 15th, 2024, this range would be from January 1st, 2024, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2024.
2.  `report_months_base`:
    *   First, we take all `Sales` and calculate `sale_month_dt` by truncating `sale_date` to the start of its month.
    *   We filter these to include only sales falling within our defined 6-month window (`start_period_val` to `end_period_val`).
    *   Then, we use `PARTITION` by `sale_month_dt` and `CALCULATE month_val = sale_month_dt` to get a distinct list of months within the window that had at least one sale (from any salesperson). This forms the set of months for our report.
3.  `result`:
    *   We iterate over each `month_val` from `report_months_base`.
    *   For each `month_val`, we calculate:
        *   `month`: This is simply `month_val`, representing the month of the report row.
        *   `PMSPS`: We count records in the `Sales` collection. These sales must satisfy two conditions:
            1.  Their `sale_date` (truncated to the month) matches the current `month_val`.
            2.  The sale was made by a salesperson whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
        *   `PMSR`: We sum the `sale_price` of sales records meeting the same two conditions as for `PMSPS`.
    *   If, for a given `month_val`, no sales meet these criteria (e.g., sales in that month were not by the specified salespersons), `COUNT` will be 0 and `SUM` will effectively be 0, satisfying the requirement to include months where metrics are 0.
4.  Finally, the results are ordered by `month` in ascending order.",124.4365737438202,"# Define the start and end of the 6-month period (excluding the current month)

- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- `AVG(Sales.WHERE(...).sale_price)` calculates the average sale price.
- `Sales.WHERE(...)` filters the sales:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures the sales are from the year 2023.
    - `ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), (1, 2, 3))` ensures the sales are from January, February, or March (the first quarter).

3. Calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Compute the average of these day differences across all payments.
5. Round the final average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph to compute a single aggregate value.
2.  `AVG(...)`: This function will calculate the average of the day differences.
3.  `PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`:

2.  Calculate the total revenue for these sales by summing their `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost for these sales by summing the `cost` of the `car` associated with each sale.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.0`.
The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to yield a single GPM value.

# Calculate GPM for the filtered sales

    gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`:
    *   This line creates a contextless expression named `sales_in_2023`.
    *   It filters the `Sales` collection to retain only records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.

2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database graph (`Dealership`). This is suitable for calculating a single aggregate value for the entire dataset.

3.  `calculated_total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`:
    *   Inside the first `CALCULATE`, this defines `calculated_total_revenue`.
    *   It computes the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records present in the `sales_in_2023` collection (i.e., sales from 2023).

4.  `calculated_total_cost = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`:
    *   This defines `calculated_total_cost`.
    *   It computes the sum of the `cost` of the cars associated with each sale in `sales_in_2023`. `sales_in_2023.car` navigates from a sale record to its associated car record, and `car.cost` accesses the cost of that car.

5.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`:
    *   This second `CALCULATE` operates on the output of the first one (which is a single row containing `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost`).
    *   `gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost`:
        *   This line computes the Gross Profit Margin using the GPM formula provided: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
        *   `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost` (derived in the previous `CALCULATE` step) are used here.
        *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures that the division results in a floating-point number and the final value is expressed as a percentage.
        *   The final GPM value is assigned to a field named `gpm_2023`.

3.  We use `WHERE(HAS(condition) == 1)` to filter sales that meet this criterion. The `condition` will be on `car.inventory_snapshots`.
4.  From these filtered sales, we select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`: This filters the sales.

    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This ensures that at least one such inventory snapshot exists for the car associated with the sale.
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: From the sales that meet the above criteria, this selects the top 1 sale based on `sale_price` in descending order (i.e., the one with the highest sale price).

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` will give us the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.
    *   So, we need records where this difference is between 0 and 6 (inclusive).
3.  Count the number of sales records that meet this date criteria.
4.  Assign this count to a field named `TSC` using the top-level `Dealership` collection.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_in_last_7_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to 'now'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is within the last 6 days from 'now' (inclusive of 'now', making it a 7-day window).
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only sales within this 7-day period are selected.
2.  `total_sales_count_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(TSC = COUNT(sales_in_last_7_days))`: This line calculates the final result.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering, this `CALCULATE` function computes new fields for each salesperson:
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`: Stores the salesperson's first name.
    *   `sp_last_name=last_name`: Stores the salesperson's last name.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: We store the first and last names in new variables to be used later.
    *   `num_recent_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30))`: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection. We then filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days from the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). `COUNT` then gives us the number of such sales.
    *   `total_recent_revenue=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30).sale_price), 0.0)`: Similarly, we filter the `sales_made` for the last 30 days and then `SUM` their `sale_price` to get the total revenue. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no recent sales, their revenue is 0.
2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=num_recent_sales.DESC())`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons. The ranking is based on `num_recent_sales` in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the most recent sales appear first.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step formats the output for the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`: Retrieves the stored names.
    *   `sales_count=num_recent_sales`: Assigns the calculated number of recent sales to `sales_count`.
    *   `total_revenue_amount=total_recent_revenue`: Assigns the calculated total recent revenue to `total_revenue_amount`.",32.561065673828125,"top_salespersons_by_recent_sales = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection, as it contains customer information including their `state` and their purchase history (`car_purchases`).
2.  Group the customers by `state` using the `PARTITION` function.
3.  For each state group, calculate:
    *   The name of the state.
    *   The number of unique customers in that state. Since we partition by state, counting customers within each partition gives us the unique count for that state.
    *   The total revenue generated from sales to customers in that state. This is done by summing the `sale_price` from all `car_purchases` (which are `Sales` records) associated with the customers in that state.
4.  Finally, use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 states based on the calculated total revenue, in descending order.

```python

Each resulting group (named `state_group` internally for context, though we refer to its sub-collection of customers as `Customers` within the `CALCULATE`) represents a unique state.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each state group, this function calculates new fields:
    *   `state_name=state`:  Assigns the state (which is the partition key) to the `state_name` field.
    *   `num_unique_customers=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers within the current state partition. Since customers are grouped by state, this effectively gives the number of unique customers for that state.
    *   `total_revenue_for_state=SUM(Customers.car_purchases.sale_price)`: Calculates the total revenue for the current state. It accesses the `car_purchases` (list of sales) for all `Customers` within the state partition and sums their `sale_price`.

3.  For each `payment_method` group, calculate:

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car via the `car` relationship. These are aliased as `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model` to be used as partition keys.
2.  `grouped_by_model = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: The `sales_with_details` collection is then partitioned. The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by unique combinations of `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model`. Each group is named `sales_per_model_group`.
3.  `model_summary = grouped_by_model.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `make`: The car make (from the partition key `resolved_car_make`).
    *   `model`: The car model (from the partition key `resolved_car_model`).
    *   `total_number_of_sales`: The total count of sales for that specific make and model, obtained using `COUNT(Sales)`.
    *   `total_revenue`: The sum of `sale_price` for all sales of that specific make and model, obtained using `SUM(Sales.sale_price)`.
4.  `top_models_by_revenue = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, `TOP_K` is applied to the `model_summary` to get the top 5 entries, ordered by `total_revenue` in descending order.

2.  Create a contextless boolean expression `is_sale_in_period` to identify sales that fall within this defined time period. This helps in keeping the main query cleaner.
3.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson:
    a.  Calculate `total_num_sales_in_period` by counting their sales (`sales_made`) that satisfy the `is_sale_in_period` condition.
    b.  Calculate `total_revenue_in_period` by summing the `sale_price` of these filtered sales. The problem defines revenue as the sum of `sale_price`.
4.  Filter these results to include only salespersons with `total_revenue_in_period > 0`. This ensures that only representatives with positive revenue in the specified period are considered for the top ranking.

1.  Access the `PaymentsMade` collection.
2.  Filter these payments to include only those where the `vendor_name` is 'Utility Company'.
3.  Further filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). I will use the `DAYNAME()` function to get the name of the day for the `payment_date` and check if it is 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.
4.  Finally, I will count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database, as we want a single aggregated result.
2.  `num_weekend_utility_payments=COUNT(...)`: This defines the field we want to calculate, which is the count of certain payments.
3.  `PaymentsMade.WHERE(...)`: We start by accessing the `PaymentsMade` collection and then apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  `(vendor_name == 'Utility Company')`: This is the first condition within the `WHERE` clause, filtering for payments made to 'Utility Company'.
5.  `& (ISIN(DAYNAME(payment_date), ('Saturday', 'Sunday')))`: This is the second condition, combined with the first using `&` (AND).
    *   `DAYNAME(payment_date)`: This function extracts the name of the day of the week (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday"") from the `payment_date`.
    *   `ISIN(..., ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: This function checks if the extracted day name is present in the tuple `('Saturday', 'Sunday')`, effectively filtering for weekend payments.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
    *   We'll calculate the start date (Monday) and end date (Sunday) of the week immediately preceding the current week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week.
    *   Subtracting 7 days from this gives the Monday of the previous week.
    *   Subtracting 1 day from the Monday of the current week gives the Sunday of the previous week.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated previous week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   Extract the calendar day from `payment_date` (by truncating it to the start of the day) to ensure daily aggregation.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for further processing.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered and prepared payments by the extracted calendar day and `payment_method`.
    *   For each group (each day and payment method combination), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.

5.  **Select and Order Results**:
    *   The final output will include the transaction date (day), the payment method, and the total amount for that combination.
    *   The results will be ordered by date and then by payment method for clarity.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.
        *   `payment_amount_from_data = payment_amount`: Aliases `payment_amount` for clarity.

3.  `result = payments_for_grouping.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_extracted, payment_method_from_data))`: This groups the `payments_for_grouping` data. Each group will consist of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_extracted` and have the same `payment_method_from_data`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `transaction_date = payment_day_extracted`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_type = payment_method_from_data`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_by_method = SUM(payments_for_grouping.payment_amount_from_data)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount_from_data` for all payments within the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(transaction_date.ASC(), payment_method_type.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the transaction date in ascending order, and then by payment method type, also in ascending order. This makes the output easy to read.

3.  We will then partition (group) these processed sales records by the customer's state and the calculated quarter start date.
4.  For each group, we will sum the `sale_price` to get the `total_quarterly_sales`.

    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters sales to include only those made in the year 2023.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)` derives two new fields for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: Stores the `state` from the linked `customer` record.
        *   `q_start_date`: Determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. This is done using nested `IFF` functions based on the month of the sale. String literals like ""2023-01-01"" are used to represent these dates.

2.  `result = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code aims to identify cars that were in inventory during the latest snapshot taken in March 2023.

1.  **`march_2023_snapshots = InventorySnapshots.WHERE(...)`**:
    This line filters the `InventorySnapshots` collection to include only those records where the `snapshot_date` falls within March 2023. It checks that the year of `snapshot_date` is 2023 and the month is 3 (March).

2.  **`latest_snapshots_in_march = march_2023_snapshots.WHERE(...)`**:
    From the snapshots taken in March 2023, this step identifies those that occurred on the latest date.
    The `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), allow_ties=True) == 1` function is used:
    *   `by=snapshot_date.DESC()`: Ranks the snapshots in descending order of their `snapshot_date`, so the latest date gets rank 1.
    *   `allow_ties=True`: Ensures that if multiple snapshots were taken on the same latest date, all of them are ranked as 1.
    *   `== 1`: Filters to keep only those snapshots with rank 1 (i.e., taken on the latest date in March 2023).

3.  **`cars_in_inventory_on_latest_snapshot_date = latest_snapshots_in_march.WHERE(...)`**:
    This line further filters the snapshots from the latest date in March 2023 to include only those where the `is_in_inventory` field is `True`. This condition signifies that the car associated with the snapshot was indeed in inventory.

4.  **`result = cars_in_inventory_on_latest_snapshot_date.car.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `cars_in_inventory_on_latest_snapshot_date.car`: For each filtered snapshot record, this accesses the related `Car` object through the `car` relationship.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection, as we need to calculate a value for each drug.
2.  For each drug, we will calculate its `avg_ddd_value`. This involves:
    a.  Accessing the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for the current drug.
    b.  Filtering these treatments to include only those where `end_dt` is not null, as specified in the DDD definition.
    c.  For the remaining treatments, calculate the `treatment_duration_days` using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`.
    d.  Further filter these treatments to include only those where `treatment_duration_days` is greater than 0. This ensures the treatment had a positive duration and avoids division by zero when calculating DDD.
    e.  For each valid treatment, calculate its individual DDD value using the formula: `ddd_for_this_treatment = tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    f.  The `AVG` aggregation function is then used on the collection of these `ddd_for_this_treatment` values to compute the average DDD for the current drug.
3.  The final result will include the `drug_name` and the calculated `avg_ddd_value`.

    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

The PyDough code starts by iterating through each record in the `Drugs` collection.

For each drug:
-   It selects the `drug_name`.
-   It calculates `avg_ddd_value` using the `AVG` aggregation function. The input to `AVG` is a collection of DDD values derived from the drug's associated treatments (`treatments_used_in`).
-   The process to get these individual DDD values is as follows:
    1.  `treatments_used_in.WHERE(HAS(end_dt) == 1)`: Filters the treatments to only include those where `end_dt` is present (not null).
    2.  `.CALCULATE(treatment_duration_days=DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For these filtered treatments, it calculates the duration in days between `start_dt` and `end_dt`.
    3.  `.WHERE(treatment_duration_days > 0)`: It further filters the treatments to ensure the calculated `treatment_duration_days` is positive, preventing division by zero and ensuring meaningful DDDs.
    4.  `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_this_treatment=tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days)`: For treatments that pass both filters, it calculates the DDD using the formula `tot_drug_amt / treatment_duration_days`.
    5.  `.ddd_for_this_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_this_treatment` values, forming a collection of numbers that `AVG` can then average.

The final output `drug_avg_ddd` will contain each drug's name and its corresponding average DDD. If a drug has no valid treatments to calculate DDD (e.g., all treatments have null `end_dt` or zero/negative duration), its `avg_ddd_value` will typically be null.",42.343544006347656,"drug_avg_ddd = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need to identify treatments that started in the three full months prior to the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt`: The first day of the current month.
    *   `three_months_ago_start_dt`: The first day of the month, three months before the current month.
    *   The relevant treatments will have `start_dt >= three_months_ago_start_dt` and `start_dt < current_month_start_dt`.

2.  **Prepare Treatment Data**: For each treatment within this time window:
    *   Extract the `patient_id`.
    *   Determine the month of treatment in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-01"") using its `start_dt`.
    *   Check if the treatment involved a biologic drug (`drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`).

3.  **Group by Month and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the prepared treatment data by the ""YYYY-MM"" month string.
    *   For each month:
        *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s. This is the `patient_count`.
        *   Calculate the number of distinct `patient_id`s for treatments that were biologic. This is the `biologic_treatment_count`.

4.  **Order Results**: Sort the results by month in ascending order.

The `LPAD` function for formatting the month string is assumed to be available as it appears in the provided PyDough examples.

```python
# Define the start of the current month and the start of the period 3 months ago
current_month_start_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
three_months_ago_start_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-3 months')

# Filter treatments for the last 3 full months and gather necessary information
# This includes patient_id, a formatted month string, and a flag for biologic drugs.

    # Create a 'YYYY-MM' string for the treatment month
    treatment_month_year_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", YEAR(start_dt), LPAD(MONTH(start_dt), 2, ""0"")),

    biologic_treatment_count = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(patient_id, is_biologic_treatment == True))
).ORDER_BY(month.ASC()) # Order results by month
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_dt` and `three_months_ago_start_dt` define the time range for treatments: the three full calendar months preceding the current month.
2.  `Treatments.WHERE(...)` filters treatments to include only those starting within this defined three-month period.
3.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` processes these filtered treatments:
    *   `patient_id = patient_id`: Selects the `patient_id` for each treatment.
    *   `treatment_month_year_str = JOIN_STRINGS(...)`: Creates a string representation of the treatment month (e.g., ""2024-01"") from the `start_dt`. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits.
    *   `is_biologic_treatment = (drug.drug_type == 'biologic')`: Checks if the drug used in the treatment is of type 'biologic' and creates a boolean flag.
4.  `treatments_info.PARTITION(...)`: Groups the processed treatment records by the `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  The final `CALCULATE` operates on each monthly group:
    *   `month = treatment_month_year_str`: Outputs the month string.
    *   `patient_count = NDISTINCT(patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id`s within that month's group.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count = NDISTINCT(KEEP_IF(patient_id, is_biologic_treatment == True))`: Counts the number of unique `patient_id`s for whom `is_biologic_treatment` was true in that month's group. `KEEP_IF` returns `patient_id` only if the condition is met, otherwise null; `NDISTINCT` then counts the unique non-null `patient_id`s.

1.  First, we'll start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve `doc_id`, `speciality`, and compute `num_distinct_drugs`. The `num_distinct_drugs` is calculated by counting the distinct drug IDs from the `drug` associated with each doctor's `prescribed_treatments`. This new collection is named `doctors_with_drug_counts`.
3.  Next, we `PARTITION` the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection by `speciality`. We name these partitions `specialty_group`.
4.  After partitioning, we access the items within each `specialty_group` (which are the records from `doctors_with_drug_counts` belonging to that specialty).
5.  On these items, we use another `CALCULATE` to select the final fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`.
6.  In this final `CALCULATE`, we also compute `SDRSDR`. This is done using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `per=""specialty_group""` (meaning within each specialty), ordered by `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (so doctors prescribing more distinct drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., rank 1).

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first determine the relevant 12-month period. This period starts from the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current month and ends on the last day of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is July 15, 2024, the window will span from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each selected treatment, we extract the year and month from its `start_dt`. These will serve as keys for grouping. This step effectively truncates the `start_dt` to the month level as requested.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the filtered and prepared treatments by year and month. This creates distinct groups, each representing one month within our 12-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each monthly group, we count the number of unique `patient_id` values associated with the treatments in that month. This represents the number of distinct patients who received a diagnosis (as implied by a treatment record) during that month.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each monthly group, we count the total number of treatment records. This gives the total treatments administered in that month.
6.  **Format and Order**: We format the year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for clear presentation and order the results chronologically.

The final output will list each of the last 12 months along with its corresponding PMPD and PMTC values.

1.  **Identify First Treatment Year for Each Patient**: For each patient, we find the earliest start date of any treatment they received. The year of this date is considered the year they became a ""new patient"". We filter out patients who have never received any treatment.
2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: We group the patients by their ""first treatment year"" and count how many unique patients fall into each year. This gives us the number of new patients for each year.
3.  **Order by Year**: The yearly counts of new patients are then ordered chronologically by year. This is necessary for the next step, which involves comparing with the previous year.
4.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI (New Patients Increase) is calculated as the number of new patients in the current year minus the number of new patients in the previous year. For the earliest year in the dataset (which has no preceding year), the NPI will be equal to the number of new patients in that year (assuming zero new patients before that).

Here's the PyDough code:

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`: This line starts with the `Patients` collection. It filters out patients who have no treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`. Then, for each remaining patient, it calculates `year_of_first_treatment` by finding the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` among all their `treatments_received` and extracting the year from that date.
2.  `new_patients_by_year`: This takes `patient_first_treatment_info` and partitions it by `year_of_first_treatment`. For each year group, it calculates:
    *   `year_val`: The year of the group.

1.  **Filter Relevant Outcomes**: We first identify the outcome records that have non-null PASI scores for both day 7 (`day7_pasi_score`) and day 100 (`day100_pasi_score`). This is crucial because the D7D100PIR calculation relies on both these values. We use `HAS(field_name) == 1` to check for non-null values.
2.  **Calculate Global Average PASI Scores**:
    *   Compute the average `day7_pasi_score` across all the filtered outcome records.
    *   Compute the average `day100_pasi_score` across all the filtered outcome records.
    These calculations are performed at the `DermTreatment` (graph) level to get overall averages.
3.  **Apply the D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the calculated global averages in the provided formula:
    `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100.0`.
    Multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and maintains floating-point precision.
4.  **Return the Percentage Value**: The final result should be a single percentage value representing the overall D7D100PIR.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_pasi_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE((HAS(day7_pasi_score) == 1) & (HAS(day100_pasi_score) == 1))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Outcomes` collection.
    *   It filters these records using `WHERE` to keep only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. The `HAS(field_name) == 1` condition checks for non-null values.
    *   The resulting collection, `valid_pasi_outcomes`, contains all outcome records suitable for the D7D100PIR calculation.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts a calculation at the `DermTreatment` (the top-level graph) context. This is appropriate for calculating global aggregates.
    *   `avg_overall_day7_pasi = AVG(valid_pasi_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_pasi_outcomes` collection.
    *   `avg_overall_day100_pasi = AVG(valid_pasi_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_pasi_outcomes` collection.

3.  `.CALCULATE(d7d100pir_percentage = ...)`:
    *   This subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on the results of the previous one (i.e., `avg_overall_day7_pasi` and `avg_overall_day100_pasi`).
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = (avg_overall_day100_pasi - avg_overall_day7_pasi) / avg_overall_day7_pasi * 100.0`: This applies the D7D100PIR formula. The division by `avg_overall_day7_pasi` and multiplication by `100.0` (to ensure floating-point arithmetic) yields the final percentage.

        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: This calculates the average `day100_pasi_score`. The `AVG` function operates on all `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.

4.  Select the top 3 diagnoses based on the `max_itch_score` in descending order. If there's a tie in `max_itch_score`, the `TOP_K` function's default behavior for ties will apply (which usually means arbitrary order for ties unless a secondary key could be specified, but `TOP_K` takes a single expression for `by`).

**Explanation:**

*   `Diagnoses.WHERE(HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Diagnoses` collection and filters it to include only those diagnoses that have at least one treatment record which in turn has at least one outcome record. This is crucial for calculations involving outcome data like `day100_itch_vas`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new fields for each diagnosis:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Selects the name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis.

    *   `num_patients=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis. The path `treatments_for.patient.patient_id` navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments, then to the patient linked to each treatment, and finally accesses their `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` ensures each patient is counted only once.

This analysis is restricted to treatments that commenced within the last six calendar months. The final output should list the specialty, the total number of treatments administered by that specialty within the period, and the corresponding total drug amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is augmented using `CALCULATE` to include:
        *   `treatment_start_dt_calc`: The start date of the treatment, derived from the `start_dt` field.
        *   `doc_specialty_calc`: The specialty of the doctor who prescribed the treatment, accessed via `doctor.speciality`.
    *   Original fields like `tot_drug_amt` remain accessible.

2.  **Filter by Date**:
    *   The augmented treatment data is filtered using `WHERE` to include only treatments where `treatment_start_dt_calc` is on or after the start of the calendar month that was five months prior to the current month's start. This effectively covers the ""past 6 calendar months"" (e.g., if 'now' is July, this includes treatments from February 1st onwards).
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-5 months')` calculates this boundary date.

3.  **Group by Specialty and Aggregate**:
    *   The filtered `recent_treatments_info` collection is then partitioned by `doc_specialty_calc` using `PARTITION(name=""docs_by_specialty"", by=(doc_specialty_calc))`.
    *   Within each specialty group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute:
        *   `specialty`: The doctor's specialty (from `doc_specialty_calc`).
        *   `number_of_treatments`: The count of treatments for that specialty within the filtered period, obtained using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
        *   `total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments by that specialty in the filtered period, obtained using `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`.

4.  **Select Top 3 Specialties**:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount.DESC())` is applied to the `specialty_summary` to retrieve the top 3 specialties ranked by `total_drug_amount` in descending order.

The resulting collection will contain the specialty, number of treatments, and total drug amount for the top 3 specialties.

2.  For each drug, calculate:

    *   The average total drug amount (`average_drug_amount`) from the `tot_drug_amt` field in its `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
3.  Use the `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())` function to select the 5 drugs with the highest number of treatments.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to output the `drug_name`, `num_treatments`, and `average_drug_amount` for these top 5 drugs.

The ""top 5"" is determined primarily by the number of treatments. The average drug amount is an additional metric calculated and displayed for these selected drugs.

Explanation:
The PyDough code performs the following operations:
1.  `Drugs.WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in)==1)`: Filters the `Drugs` collection to retain only those drugs that have at least one associated treatment. This ensures that subsequent calculations like `COUNT` and `AVG` are meaningful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of the filtered drugs, this step calculates three new fields:
    *   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with each drug.
    *   `average_drug_amount=AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`: Calculates the average of the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with each drug.
3.  `.TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments.DESC())`: From the collection of drugs with their calculated statistics, this selects the top 5 drugs. The ranking is based on `num_treatments` in descending order (highest number of treatments first).
4.  `.CALCULATE(drug_name=drug_name, num_treatments=num_treatments, average_drug_amount=average_drug_amount)`: This final step ensures that only the requested fields (`drug_name`, `num_treatments`, `average_drug_amount`) are present in the final output for the top 5 drugs.",48.77671241760254,"result = Drugs.WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in)==1).CALCULATE(

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"The user wants to count treatments based on three main criteria:
1.  The associated diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"" (case-insensitively, with wildcards).
2.  The drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (implying it's FDA-approved).
3.  The treatment's end date is within the last 6 months from the current date and the treatment has indeed ended.

We can achieve this by:
1.  Starting with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filtering these treatments using a `WHERE` clause that combines all conditions:
    *   For the diagnosis: `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`. We use `UPPER` to ensure case-insensitivity and `%` for wildcard matching.
    *   For FDA approval: `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`, which checks if the `fda_appr_dt` field (FDA approval date) exists for the drug associated with the treatment.
    *   For the end date:
        *   The treatment must have an end date: `HAS(end_dt) == 1`.
        *   The end date must be on or before today: `end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`.
        *   The end date must be on or after 6 months ago from today: `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`.
3.  Counting the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Filter treatments based on the specified criteria
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &                       # Drug has an FDA approval date
    (HAS(end_dt) == 1) &                                 # Treatment has an end date

    (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))                          # Treatment has ended (end date is not in the future)
)

# Calculate the total count of such treatments
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters.
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`: This condition checks if the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with the treatment contains ""psoriasis"". `UPPER` is used on `diag_name` and the pattern is in uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching. The `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the `drug` used in the treatment has an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), implying it's FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months ago from the current time. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment `end_dt` is not in the future, meaning the treatment has indeed ended by today.
    *   All these conditions are combined with the logical `&` (AND) operator, so a treatment must satisfy all of them.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_treatments` contains all treatments meeting the criteria.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_treatments)` counts the number of records in this filtered collection.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Determine Target Registration Year**:
    *   `target_reg_year_val = YEAR(DATETIME('now')) - 2` calculates the year that was exactly two years prior to the current year. `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp, and `YEAR()` extracts the year.

2.  **Filter Doctors**:
    *   `Doctors.WHERE(...)` starts by accessing the `Doctors` collection.
    *   The condition `(year_reg == target_reg_year_val)` filters for doctors whose registration year (`year_reg`) matches the calculated `target_reg_year_val`.
    *   The condition `(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)` further filters these doctors to include only those who have at least one treatment record in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection. This ensures that we can meaningfully retrieve a ""first treatment"".

3.  **Calculate Required Information**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` is used to select and compute the final fields for each qualifying doctor.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's year of registration.
    *   `first_treatment_date=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1).SINGULAR().start_dt`:
        *   This expression identifies the date of the doctor's first treatment.
        *   `prescribed_treatments` refers to the treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)` ranks these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `per=""Doctors""` clause ensures this ranking is performed independently for each doctor. `allow_ties=False` means if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, one will be chosen (typically the first encountered).
        *   `.WHERE(... == 1)` filters to get only the treatment(s) ranked as first.
        *   `.SINGULAR()` converts the resulting single-item collection (representing the first treatment) into a single record context, allowing access to its fields.
        *   `.start_dt` then extracts the start date of this first treatment.
    *   `first_treatment_id=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1).SINGULAR().treatment_id`:
        *   This is similar to the above, but it extracts the `treatment_id` (referred to as ""_id"" in the request) of the first treatment.

4.  **Final Assignment**:
    *   `result = doctors_with_first_treatment_info` assigns the final collection of results to the variable `result`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AdverseEvents.WHERE(...)`**: We start by querying the `AdverseEvents` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
2.  **`DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)`**: This function calculates the difference in days between the treatment start date (`treatment.start_dt`) and the adverse event reported date (`reported_dt`).
    *   `treatment.start_dt`: Accesses the `start_dt` field from the related `Treatments` record through the `treatment` link in the `AdverseEvents` collection.
3.  **`(DATEDIFF(...) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(...) <= 10)`**: This condition filters for adverse events where the `reported_dt` is on or after the `treatment.start_dt` and no more than 10 days after the `treatment.start_dt`.

For these identified treatments, the query should return the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates for *all* concomitant medications associated with these treatments (not just the ones meeting the two-week condition).

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Define the Date Condition**: A contextless expression `med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment` is defined. This condition checks if a concomitant medication's `start_dt` is on or after the parent treatment's `start_dt` and no more than 14 days after it. `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the medication's start and the treatment's start.
2.  **Select Qualifying Treatments**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is filtered first for `is_placebo == True`.
    *   It's further filtered using `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment)) == 1`. This ensures that only treatments having at least one concomitant medication satisfying the defined date condition are selected. The result is stored in `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`.
3.  **Retrieve Desired Information**:
    *   From `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`, we navigate to their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This will include *all* concomitant medications for the selected treatments.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function is then used to specify the output fields:
        *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the treatment (from the parent `Treatments` record).
        *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the treatment.
        *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the treatment.
        *   `med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from the current `ConcomitantMeds` record).
        *   `med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

This approach ensures that if a placebo treatment meets the criteria (having at least one med starting within 2 weeks), then all of its concomitant medications are listed along with the treatment details.

```python

5.  Round the final average age to the nearest integer.
6.  The result will be a single value representing this average age, calculated on the `DermTreatment` graph.

```python

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions where `status == ""completed""` are successful and that these are typically `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Calculate the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This will be the numerator for CPUR. We'll use `NDISTINCT` on the `coupon_id` field of the successful transactions.
4.  Calculate the total number of distinct successful transactions. This will be the denominator for CPUR. We'll use `COUNT` on the successful transactions.
5.  Compute CPUR as `(number of distinct coupons used) / (number of distinct transactions)`.
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
7.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

This is achieved using a two-step `CALCULATE`:
*   The first `CALCULATE` computes the counts for distinct coupons and distinct transactions.
*   The second `CALCULATE` uses these counts to compute CPUR and selects the final required fields.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
2.  `merchant_name=name`: We select the merchant's name.
3.  `num_distinct_coupons = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`:
    *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(status == ""completed"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those marked as ""completed"" (assumed to be successful).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` for each of these successful transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions. This gives the number of distinct coupons used.
4.  `num_distinct_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`:
    *   This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the results from the first:
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant name.
    *   `CPUR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_transactions > 0, ...)`: This checks if there are any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons / num_distinct_successful_transactions`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the total number of successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.

The results should be grouped by week.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **`Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`**: Filters the `Users` collection to include only users whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.
2.  **`.notifications`**: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for these filtered users.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each notification, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`: Truncates the `created_at` timestamp of the notification to the start of its week. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_notification = ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: Determines if the notification was created on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). `DAYNAME(created_at)` extracts the name of the day, and `ISIN` checks if it's one of the specified weekend days. This results in a boolean value (True if weekend, False otherwise).
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters these processed notifications to include only those from the last three weeks, excluding the current week. This is done by checking if `notification_week_start` is one of:
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 week')`: The start of last week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-2 weeks')`: The start of the week before last.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-3 weeks')`: The start of the week three weeks ago.
5.  **`.PARTITION(name=""weekly_summary"", by=(notification_week_start))`**: Groups the filtered notifications by the `notification_week_start`. Each group will represent one of the three target weeks.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (i.e., each week) created by the `PARTITION` clause:
    *   `week = notification_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for the output.
    *   `total_notifications = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications within that specific week's group. `Notifications` here refers to the sub-collection of notifications belonging to the current partition.
    *   `weekend_notifications = SUM(Notifications.is_weekend_notification)`: Sums the `is_weekend_notification` boolean flag for all notifications in that week's group. Assuming boolean True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in `SUM` (as suggested by PyDough examples like `SUM(is_active)`), this effectively counts the weekend notifications.
7.  **`.ORDER_BY(week.DESC())`**: Orders the final results by the week's start date in descending order, so the most recent of the three weeks appears first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_user_balances`: This line filters the `UserBalances` collection. It keeps only those records where the `updated_at` timestamp is within the last 7 days, inclusive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7` achieves this by calculating the number of full days between `updated_at` and the current moment.
2.  `user_amb_values`: This part takes the `recent_user_balances` and groups them by `user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each user), it calculates `amb_for_this_user` as the average of their `balance` values found in the `recent_user_balances`. This aligns with the definition of AMB as the average balance per user for the specified time duration.
3.  `result`: This final step computes a single global value. It takes all the `amb_for_this_user` values calculated in the previous step and computes their average using `AVG()`.

1.  We start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we will calculate a new field called `LUB`.
3.  To determine the `LUB`, we look into the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user. These are `UserBalances` records, each having an `updated_at` timestamp and a `balance` amount.
4.  We use the `RANKING` window function on these `balances`. The ranking is performed `by` the `updated_at` field in descending order (`DESC()`), ensuring the most recent balance gets the top rank. The `per=""Users""` argument ensures this ranking is done independently for each user's set of balances.
5.  We then filter these ranked balances to keep only the one where `RANKING(...) == 1`, which corresponds to the latest balance entry.
6.  Since this filtering results in at most one balance record per user, we use `.SINGULAR()` to treat it as a single record.
7.  Finally, we extract the `balance` field from this singular, latest balance record.

This involves summing up the amounts from successfully received transactions where the merchant is the receiver and `receiver_type` is 1. Then, merchants are ranked based on this revenue.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the PyDough code:

1.  **Calculate Revenue per Merchant**:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue. This revenue is the sum of `amount` from their `transactions_received`.
    *   These transactions are filtered to include only those that were ""successfully received"" (assumed `status == ""completed""`) and where the `receiver_type` on the transaction record is 1 (as specified for merchants).
    *   The merchant's `name` and `category` are also selected. These intermediate results are stored in `merchant_data`.

2.  **Rank Merchants and Select Final Output**:
    *   Using the `merchant_data` (which now has `m_name`, `m_category`, and `m_revenue` for each merchant), we perform a second `CALCULATE`.
    *   We select the `merchant_name` (from `m_name`), `category` (from `m_category`), and `revenue_amount` (from `m_revenue`).
    *   The `revenue_rank` is computed using the `RANKING()` window function. It ranks merchants in descending order of their `m_revenue` (so rank 1 is the highest revenue), which aligns with the definition of MRR.
    *   The final result includes the merchant's name, category, their total revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition (`ewallet_context_vars`):**
    *   `calc_start_of_target_period`: Determines the start date for transactions. It's set to the first day of the month that is two months before the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be May 1st).
    *   `calc_end_of_target_period`: Determines the end date (exclusive). It's set to the first day of the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be July 1st, so transactions up to June 30th are included).
    *   This ensures the query considers transactions from the last two full months, excluding the current month.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`filtered_transactions`):**
    *   Selects transactions from the `Ewallet.Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters for transactions where `sender_type == 0`, as specified for active users.
    *   Applies the date range calculated in the previous step (`created_at >= calc_start_of_target_period` and `created_at < calc_end_of_target_period`).

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`transactions_for_monthly_aggregation`):**
    *   From the filtered transactions, it extracts the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of `created_at` into `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This effectively ""truncates created_at to month for aggregation.""
    *   `sender_id` is aliased to `user_sender_id` for clarity.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`):**
    *   The prepared transaction data is partitioned by `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This groups all transaction records by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `pmdau_year`: The year of the report.
        *   `pmdau_month`: The month of the report.
        *   `pmdau_value`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(user_sender_id)`. This count represents the number of unique users (senders with `sender_type = 0`) who were active (made at least one transaction) during that specific month.

5.  **Result:**
    *   The final output (`result`) will contain rows for each of the two target months, with the corresponding year, month, and the calculated PMDAU value (which, by this interpretation, is the count of unique active senders in that month).",103.8663294315338,"# Define date boundaries globally.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection to process each user.
2.  For each user, calculate the sum of durations of their sessions that fall within the specified date range.
    *   Access the `sessions` sub-collection (which corresponds to `UserSessions`).
    *   Filter these sessions where `session_start_ts` is on or after ""2023-06-01T00:00:00"" and before ""2023-06-08T00:00:00"".

    *   Sum these individual session durations to get the `total_duration_val` for the user.
3.  Filter the results to include only users who actually had at least one session within the specified date range. This is done using `HAS()` on the filtered sessions.
4.  Sort the resulting list of users by their `total_duration_val` in descending order (longest duration first). `na_pos='last'` is used for robustness, though `total_duration_val` is expected to be numeric (0 if no relevant sessions after the `HAS` filter, or if `SUM` of empty/nulls is 0).

1.  `user_session_data = Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each user in the `Users` collection.
    *   `user_id_val = uid`: We store the user's unique identifier (`uid`) as `user_id_val`.
    *   `total_duration_val = SUM(...)`: For each user, we calculate the sum of session durations.
        *   `sessions.WHERE(...)`: We access the user's `sessions` (which are `UserSessions` records linked to this user) and filter them based on the `session_start_ts` to include only those within the range \[2023-06-01 00:00:00, 2023-06-08 00:00:00).
        *   `.CALCULATE(single_session_duration = DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts))`: For each of these filtered sessions, we calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF`.
        *   `.single_session_duration`: This extracts the calculated duration, which is then summed up by the outer `SUM()` function to get the total session time for the user in the specified period.

2.  `result = user_session_data.WHERE(...)`: We take the `user_session_data` (which now has `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` for all users).
    *   `HAS(sessions.WHERE(...)) == 1`: We filter this list to keep only users who had at least one session within the specified date range. This ensures that users with no relevant activity are not included in the final result.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(total_duration_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: The filtered list of users is then sorted by their `total_duration_val` in descending order, so users with the longest session durations appear first. `na_pos='last'` handles any potential null values for duration by placing them at the end.
    *   `.CALCULATE(user_id = user_id_val, total_duration = total_duration_val)`: Finally, we select the `user_id_val` and `total_duration_val` and rename them to `user_id` and `total_duration` respectively, as requested for the output.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter this collection to select the merchant with `mid == 1`.
3.  Access the `coupons` sub-collection of this specific merchant.
4.  For each coupon in this sub-collection, calculate the sum of the `amount` from all transactions associated with it (via the `transaction_used_in` relationship).
5.  The final result will include the coupon's ID (`cid`) and the calculated total transaction amount.

```python
coupon_transaction_totals = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons.CALCULATE(
    coupon_id=cid,
    total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection to select only the merchant whose `mid` (merchant ID) is 1.
2.  `.coupons`: This accesses the `coupons` sub-collection associated with the filtered merchant. This gives us a list of all coupons offered by merchant 1.
3.  `.CALCULATE(coupon_id=cid, total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount))`: This operation is performed for each coupon obtained in the previous step.
    *   `coupon_id=cid`: It selects the `cid` (coupon ID) of the current coupon and renames it to `coupon_id` in the output.
    *   `total_amount=SUM(transaction_used_in.amount)`: For the current coupon, it accesses its `transaction_used_in` sub-collection (which lists all transactions where this coupon was used). It then calculates the sum of the `amount` field for all these transactions. This sum is named `total_amount` in the output.

The final result, `coupon_transaction_totals`, will be a collection where each record contains the `coupon_id` and the `total_amount` transacted using that coupon for merchant with ID 1. If a coupon has no transactions, the `SUM` function is expected to return 0 for its `total_amount`.",18.12855744361877,"coupon_transaction_totals = Merchants.WHERE(mid == 1).coupons.CALCULATE(

Return the total count.TUC = Total number of user sessions in the past month","SELECT COUNT(*) AS TUC FROM user_sessions WHERE session_start_ts >= DATE('now', '-1 month') OR session_end_ts >= DATE('now', '-1 month');",Ewallet,"To calculate the TUC (Total number of user sessions in the past month, inclusive of 1 month ago), we need to perform the following steps:

1.  **Define the time window**: The ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"" means we need to consider sessions that started from exactly one month before the current timestamp up to the current timestamp. We can define the start of this period using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
2.  **Access User Sessions**: We will use the `UserSessions` collection, which contains records of user sessions.
3.  **Filter Sessions**: We'll filter these sessions based on their `session_start_ts` to include only those that fall within our defined time window.
4.  **Count Sessions**: After filtering, we will count the number of resulting sessions.
5.  **Return the Count**: The final result will be a single value representing the total count, aliased as TUC.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the start of the time window: exactly one month ago from the current moment.
one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')

# Filter UserSessions to include only those started in the past month (inclusive of 1 month ago).
sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)

# The result is presented as a single value from the Ewallet context.
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a contextless expression. It calculates the timestamp corresponding to exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`). This timestamp will serve as the lower bound for our time window.
2.  `sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)`: This line accesses the `UserSessions` collection and filters its records. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is greater than or equal to `one_month_ago_ts`. This effectively selects all sessions that occurred from one month ago up to the present.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   It operates on the `Ewallet` (the high-level graph) context to produce a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)` counts the number of records in the `sessions_in_past_month` collection (which are the sessions that met our time window criteria).
    *   This count is then assigned to a new field named `TUC`, as requested by the problem definition.

1.  **Define the ""previous month"" period**: We'll calculate the start and end dates of the calendar month immediately preceding the current date.
    *   The start of the previous month is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')`.
    *   The end of the previous month (exclusive) is `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`.
2.  **Identify relevant transactions**: We'll filter the `Transactions` collection for entries that:
    *   Occurred within the defined ""previous month"" period (based on `created_at`).
    *   Are ""wallet transactions"". We'll assume this means `transaction_type == ""WALLET""`.
3.  **Count total and successful transactions**:
    *   Count all transactions matching the criteria from step 2 to get the `total number of transactions`.
    *   Among these, count those that were ""successful"". We'll assume this means `status == ""COMPLETED""` to get the `number of successful transactions`.
4.  **Calculate STR**: Using the definition provided (STR = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions), we'll compute the rate. This will be expressed as a percentage. If there are no relevant transactions, STR will be 0.

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` block defines two helper variables:
    *   `_previous_month_start_date`: The exact start timestamp of the previous calendar month.
    *   `_current_month_start_date`: The exact start timestamp of the current calendar month (which serves as the exclusive end for the previous month).
2.  The second `CALCULATE` block uses these date boundaries to count:
    *   `_total_wallet_transactions_previous_month`: The total number of transactions within the previous month that have `transaction_type` equal to ""WALLET"".
    *   `_successful_wallet_transactions_previous_month`: The count of transactions from the above set that also have a `status` of ""COMPLETED"".
3.  The final `CALCULATE` block computes the `str_for_wallet_transactions_previous_month`:
    *   It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_total_wallet_transactions_previous_month` is greater than 0 to prevent division by zero.
    *   If there are transactions, it calculates STR as `(_successful_wallet_transactions_previous_month * 100.0) / _total_wallet_transactions_previous_month` to get a percentage.
    *   If there are no wallet transactions in the previous month, STR is set to `0.0`.

2.  `merchants_with_coupon_counts = merchants_with_creation_date_parts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step takes the records from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using a `WHERE` clause:
            *   `YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation year matches the merchant's creation year.
            *   `MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation month matches the merchant's creation month.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are passed through as `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val`.

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_date` in ascending order, presenting the data from the earliest month in 2023 onwards.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_from_users_info = Transactions.WHERE(sender_type == 0).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(sender_type == 0)` filters these transactions to include only those where the `sender_type` is 0 (assumed to represent users).

        *   `sender_user_id_field = sending_user.uid`: Retrieves the unique ID of the sending user.
        *   `transaction_amount_field = amount`: Retrieves the amount of the transaction.

2.  `country_summary_data = transactions_from_users_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""country_group_transactions"", by=(sender_country_field))` groups the records from `transactions_from_users_info` based on the `sender_country_field`. Each group is named `country_group_transactions`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then computes aggregates for each country group:
        *   `country = sender_country_field`: Selects the country name.
        *   `num_of_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(country_group_transactions.sender_user_id_field)`: Counts the number of unique sending users within that country group using their IDs.
        *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(country_group_transactions.transaction_amount_field)`: Sums up all transaction amounts within that country group.

3.  `top_5_countries_by_sent_amount = country_summary_data.TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the `country_summary_data` (which has one record per country with its aggregates).

**Explanation:**

*   `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Merchants` collection. The `HAS(...) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider merchants who have at least one transaction received that meets the subsequent criteria.
*   `transactions_received.WHERE(...)`: For each merchant, we look at their received transactions. This sub-collection is filtered.

    *   `receiver_type == 1`: This condition filters transactions where the `receiver_type` field on the transaction record is 1.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter these merchants to include only those who:
    *   Are active (we'll assume `status == 'active'`).
    *   Have a category that contains the string 'retail' (using `CONTAINS(category, 'retail')`).
    *   Have at least one balance record in their `balances` sub-collection (using `HAS(balances) == 1`).
3.  For each of these filtered merchants, we need to find their most recent wallet balance:
    *   Access their `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `MerchantBalances` records).
    *   Within each merchant's `balances`, rank these records by `updated_at` in descending order. The record with rank 1 is the most recent.
    *   Use `SINGULAR()` to select this single most recent balance record.
    *   Extract the `balance` amount from this record. This will result in a collection of the most recent balance amounts, one for each merchant that met the criteria.
4.  Finally, calculate the median of this collection of balance amounts. This will be done using `Ewallet.CALCULATE` to produce a single result.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == 'active'`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, 'retail')`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   `HAS(balances) == 1`: Ensures that the selected merchants have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (i.e., they have `MerchantBalances` records).
2.  `.CALCULATE(latest_balance_value = ...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered merchants. For each such merchant, it calculates a new field named `latest_balance_value`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This accesses the `balances` sub-collection for the current merchant. It then ranks these balance records by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each merchant. The `WHERE` clause filters these to keep only the top-ranked (most recent) balance record.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should yield exactly one record (the most recent balance), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record.
    *   `.balance`: This extracts the `balance` amount from that single, most recent `MerchantBalances` record.
    *   The result of this `CALCULATE` step is a new collection where each record corresponds to a filtered merchant and contains their `latest_balance_value`.
3.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_wallet_balance = MEDIAN(...))`: This takes the collection of `latest_balance_value`s (obtained by `.latest_balance_value` from the previous step's result) and calculates their median.
    *   `MEDIAN(collection.attribute)`: The `MEDIAN` function computes the median value of the specified `attribute` across all records in the `collection`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only records where the `snapshot_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered 2023 snapshots.
    *   `tx_limit_daily_val = tx_limit_daily`, `tx_limit_monthly_val = tx_limit_monthly`: These expressions select the daily and monthly transaction limits, assigning them to new field names for clarity or further use.
    *   `date_rank = RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates a rank for each snapshot within the 2023 set. `by=snapshot_date.ASC()` orders them from earliest to latest. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest `snapshot_date`, they all receive rank 1.
3.  `snapshots_2023_ranked.WHERE(date_rank == 1)`: This filters the ranked snapshots, keeping only those that have `date_rank` equal to 1. These are the earliest snapshots from 2023.

3.  Group the sessions by `device_type` using the `PARTITION` function.
4.  For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the session durations.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create a new representation of the data.
    *   `current_device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` and assigns it to a new field named `current_device_type`. This is used as the partitioning key.
    *   `duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in a new field called `duration_seconds`.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_by_device_group"", by=(current_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `current_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_by_device_group`.

        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_seconds` field (which was computed in the first `CALCULATE` step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  It filters out merchants who have no coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `m_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `m_registration_date`.
    *   The details of the earliest coupon for that merchant. This is done by:

        *   Applying a `WHERE` clause with `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), allow_ties=False) == 1`. This ranks the coupons by their `start_date` in ascending order (earliest first) within the context of the current merchant. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single coupon is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date.
        *   Using `.SINGULAR()` to convert the result (which should be a single coupon record) into a singular item accessible in `CALCULATE`. This is stored as `earliest_coupon_details`.
4.  After these calculations, another `WHERE` clause filters these merchants further:
    *   It checks if the `earliest_coupon_details.start_date` is on or after the `m_registration_date`.
    *   It also checks if the `earliest_coupon_details.start_date` is on or before one year from the `m_registration_date`. The `DATETIME(m_registration_date, '+1 year')` function is used to accurately calculate the date one year after registration.
5.  Finally, a `CALCULATE` clause selects and renames the fields for the output:
    *   `merchant_id` (from `m_id`)
    *   `registration_date` (from `m_registration_date`)
    *   `earliest_coupon_id` (from `earliest_coupon_details.cid`)
    *   `earliest_coupon_start_date` (from `earliest_coupon_details.start_date`)

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we need to determine the date that is exactly one year after their `created_at` date. This can be done using the `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')` function.
3.  We then filter the `notifications` sub-collection for each user to find any notifications that were created *before* this one-year mark (`notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`).
4.  The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check if the result of this filtered notification sub-collection is empty. If it's empty, it means the user did not receive any notifications within their first year.
5.  Users who satisfy this condition are selected.
6.  Finally, for these selected users, we retrieve their `username`, `email`, and their original `created_at` date (aliased as `signup_date`).

```python
users_without_first_year_notification = Users.WHERE(
    HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1
).CALCULATE(
    username=username,
    email=email,
    signup_date=created_at
)
```
Explanation:
-   `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
-   `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1`: This is the main condition for filtering users.
    -   `notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`: For each user, this part filters their `notifications`. It selects notifications whose `created_at` timestamp is earlier than one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp.
        -   `notifications.created_at`: Refers to the creation date of a notification.
        -   `DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`: Calculates the date one year after the user's signup date (`Users.created_at`).
    -   `HASNOT(...) == 1`: This checks if the filtered collection of notifications (those received within the first year) is empty. If it is empty, the user is included in the result.
-   `.CALCULATE(username=username, email=email, signup_date=created_at)`: For the users who meet the criteria, this selects their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date (which is their signup date, aliased here as `signup_date`).",45.321364402771,"users_without_first_year_notification = Users.WHERE(
