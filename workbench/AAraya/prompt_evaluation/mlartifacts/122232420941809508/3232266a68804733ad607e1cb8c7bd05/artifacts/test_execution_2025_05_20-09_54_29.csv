**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates:
        *   `c_name`: The customer's name.
        *   `num_total_transactions`: The total number of transactions made by the customer, using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `num_successful_transactions`: The number of successful transactions. This is calculated by counting transactions in `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `""Completed""`. **Note:** This assumes that a transaction status of `""Completed""` signifies a successful transaction, as the definition of ""success"" was not provided in the problem description.

2.  **`eligible_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`**:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It keeps only those customers who have `num_total_transactions` greater than or equal to 5, as per the requirement.

3.  **`customer_success_data = eligible_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `eligible_customers` and calculates their transaction success rate.
    *   It selects:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer (renamed from `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculated as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and performs floating-point division. Division by zero is not a concern here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures `num_total_transactions` is at least 5.

4.  **`ordered_customer_success_rates = customer_success_data.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, this step sorts the `customer_success_data` by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest), as requested.
    *   The `ordered_customer_success_rates` variable will contain the final list of customer names and their success rates, ordered appropriately.",29.745079040527344,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer.

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG tickers. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in combination with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol` within the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering the `Customers` collection directly.
5.  The final result will be a single number, so we'll use `Broker.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`: This line defines a tuple (which acts like a list in this context) containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression that makes the query cleaner.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Customers` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition. It checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Within the transactions of a customer, this filters for transactions where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` list. `ISIN` checks for membership.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the preceding filtered collection (transactions of FAANG stocks for that customer) has at least one record. If it does, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this comparison).
6.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_customers` contains the collection of customers who meet both criteria.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of records in this `filtered_customers` collection, which gives the number of distinct customers.
    *   `Broker.CALCULATE(...)` is used to create a final result with a single row, assigning the calculated count to the field `count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email`.",31.80147957801819,"# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols

1.  **Filter Stock Transactions and Add Temporal Information**:
    *   Start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   Filter these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, calculate two new fields:
        *   `transaction_week_start_date`: The start date of the week in which the transaction occurred. This is derived using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
        *   `day_name`: The name of the day of the week for the transaction (e.g., ""Monday"", ""Saturday""), derived using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.

2.  **Define and Filter by Time Window**:
    *   Calculate `current_week_start`: The start date of the current week, using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Calculate `earliest_relevant_week_start`: The start date of the 8th week prior to the current week. This is `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-56 days')` (since 8 weeks = 56 days).
    *   Filter the transactions prepared in Step 1 to include only those where `transaction_week_start_date` is greater than or equal to `earliest_relevant_week_start` AND less than `current_week_start`. This effectively selects transactions from the last 8 full weeks, excluding the current ongoing week.

3.  **Group by Week and Aggregate Counts**:
    *   Partition the filtered transactions from Step 2 by `transaction_week_start_date`. This creates groups, where each group represents a unique week.
    *   For each weekly group, calculate:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week (renaming the partition key).
        *   `total_stock_txns`: The total count of stock transactions within that week, using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns`: The count of stock transactions within that week that occurred on a ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"". This is achieved by `COUNT(Transactions.WHERE(ISIN(day_name, (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))))`.

4.  **Order Results**:
    *   Order the final results by `week_start_date` in descending order to show the most recent weeks first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `stock_transactions_with_temporal_info`: This first step filters all `Transactions` to keep only those related to 'Stock' tickers. It then augments each of these transactions with two new calculated fields: `transaction_week_start_date` (which identifies the Monday of the week the transaction occurred) and `day_name_of_transaction` (the name of the day, like ""Saturday"").
2.  `transactions_in_relevant_period`:
    *   We use `Broker.CALCULATE` to define two key dates: `def_current_week_start` (the Monday of the current week) and `def_earliest_week_to_include` (the Monday of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week).
    *   It then takes the `stock_transactions_with_temporal_info` and filters them to include only transactions whose `transaction_week_start_date` falls within the range `[def_earliest_week_to_include, def_current_week_start)`. This selects all transactions from the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
3.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   This step takes the `transactions_in_relevant_period` and partitions them using `transaction_week_start_date` as the key. This means all transactions that fall into the same week (based on their calculated `transaction_week_start_date`) are grouped together.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), it calculates:
        *   `week_start_date_output`: The start date of that specific week.
        *   `total_stock_txns_for_week`: The total number of stock transactions that occurred in that week.
        *   `weekend_stock_txns_for_week`: The number of stock transactions from that week that occurred on either ""Saturday"" or ""Sunday"", using the `day_name_of_transaction` field calculated earlier.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_week_dt = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: This contextless expression defines the exact date and time for the beginning of the current week.
2.  `start_of_last_week_dt = DATETIME(start_of_current_week_dt, '-7 days')`: This defines the beginning of the previous week by subtracting 7 days from the start of the current week.
3.  `transactions_from_us_last_week = Customers.WHERE(country == ""USA"").transactions_made.WHERE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(country == ""USA"")` filters these customers to include only those from the USA.
    *   `.transactions_made` accesses the list of transactions associated with these US customers.
    *   `.WHERE((date_time >= start_of_last_week_dt) & (date_time < start_of_current_week_dt))` filters these transactions, keeping only those whose `date_time` falls on or after the start of last week and before the start of the current week.
4.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`:

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need to identify customers whose `join_date` falls within the last 6 full months prior to the current month.
    *   `start_of_current_month`: This will be the first day of the current month.
    *   `start_of_lookback_period`: This will be the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month.
    *   The relevant `join_date` range will be `>= start_of_lookback_period` and `< start_of_current_month`.

2.  **Prepare Customer Data**:
    *   Filter `Customers` based on the `join_date` falling into the defined time window.
    *   For these customers, extract the year and month of their `join_date` to be used for grouping. Let's call these `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`.

3.  **Partition by Signup Month**:
    *   Group the filtered customers by `signup_yr` and `signup_mth` using the `PARTITION` function.

4.  **Calculate Metrics (PMCS and PMAT)**:
    *   For each group (i.e., each signup month):
        *   **PMCS**: Count the number of customers in that group. This can be done using `COUNT(Customers)`.
        *   **PMAT**: Calculate the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in that group. This can be done using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This will average over all individual transaction amounts from the customers who signed up in that specific month.

5.  **Order Results**: Optionally, order the results by signup year and month for better readability.

```python
# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions
start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
start_of_lookback_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month` and `start_of_lookback_period`: These variables define the date range for customer signups. `start_of_lookback_period` marks the beginning of the 6-month window (e.g., if today is July 15th, this would be January 1st). `start_of_current_month` marks the end of this window (exclusive, e.g., July 1st).
2.  `customers_with_signup_info`: We first access the `Customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to add new fields `signup_yr` (year of join date) and `signup_mth` (month of join date), while also keeping `cust_join_date` (the original join date) for filtering.
3.  `filtered_customers_for_period`: This step filters the augmented customer data to include only those customers whose `cust_join_date` falls within our defined 6-month window.
4.  `customer_signup_monthly_groups`: The filtered customers are then partitioned into groups based on their `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`. Each group represents a cohort of customers who signed up in the same month.
5.  `monthly_metrics`: For each `monthly_signup_cohort` (partition):
    *   `signup_year` and `signup_month` are carried over from the partition keys.
    *   `pmcs` (Per Month Customer Signups) is calculated as `COUNT(Customers)`, which counts the number of customers in the current signup cohort.
    *   `pmat` (Per Month Average Transaction Amount) is calculated as `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions made by the customers in the current signup cohort and computes the average of their `amount` values.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `signup_year` and `signup_month` for clarity.",58.79575037956238,"# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions

The AR is defined as `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Here's how the PyDough code implements this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: It first selects customers who joined in 2022 using `Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`. For each of these customers, it creates a flag `is_active_flag` which is true (1) if the customer has made any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) and false (0) otherwise. This collection is named `filtered_customers`.

2.  **Group by Country and Aggregate**: The `filtered_customers` are then partitioned by their `country` using `PARTITION(name=""country_data"", by=(country))`. For each country group:
    *   `num_active_customers_in_country`: This is calculated by summing the `is_active_flag` for all customers in that country group (`SUM(filtered_customers.is_active_flag)`). This effectively counts customers who joined in 2022, belong to the specific country, and have transactions.
    *   `total_customers_in_country_cohort`: This is the total count of customers within that country group (`COUNT(filtered_customers)`), representing all customers who joined in 2022 and belong to that country.

3.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `activity_ratio_value`.
    *   The AR is `(num_active_customers_in_country * 100.0) / total_customers_in_country_cohort`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country_cohort` might be zero (i.e., no customers joined from that country in 2022) to prevent division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   This interpretation assumes that for the cohort ""customers who joined in 2022"", ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" refers to those in the cohort with transactions, and ""Total Number of Customers"" (in the denominator of the AR formula) refers to all customers in that cohort for the given country.

4.  **Format Final Result**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `country` and `AR` as requested.

```python
# Step 1: Filter customers who joined in 2022 and flag them if they have transactions.
filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022).CALCULATE(

2.  `num_customers=COUNT(...)`: We define a field `num_customers` which will hold the count of the customers satisfying the conditions.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  `LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`: These functions convert the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase for case-insensitive comparisons.
5.  `(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'. The `|` operator represents the logical OR.
6.  `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`: This condition checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
7.  `&`: The `&` operator combines the name condition and the state condition, ensuring that both must be true for a customer to be included in the count.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection to process each ticker individually.
2.  For each ticker, define a sub-collection `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. This sub-collection filters its `transactions_of` to include only those that:
    *   Have `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred on or after one month ago from the current date (`date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
3.  Filter out tickers that have no such sell transactions in the past month using `WHERE(HAS(sell_transactions_in_past_month) == 1)`.
4.  For the remaining tickers, calculate:
    *   `total_amount`: The sum of the `amount` from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`.
    *   `total_tax_comm`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. An inner `CALCULATE` is used to sum the combined `tax + commission` per transaction, adhering to PyDough syntax for expressions within aggregations.
5.  Calculate the `SPM` using the formula: `(total_amount - total_tax_comm) / total_amount * 100.0`.
    *   An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, setting SPM to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM`.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",113.2684998512268,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Customers` collection. For each customer, we calculate:
    *   `customer_id_val=_id`: The customer's ID.
    *   `customer_name_val=name`: The customer's name.
    *   `num_tx_in_join_month=COUNT(...)`: This counts the transactions for the current customer that satisfy a specific condition.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions made in the same month and year as the customer's `join_date` are counted. `date_time` refers to the transaction's timestamp, and `join_date` refers to the customer's signup date.

2.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_tx_in_join_month.DESC())`: After calculating `num_tx_in_join_month` for all customers, this operation selects the top 1 customer based on this count in descending order. This effectively gives us the customer with the highest number of transactions in their signup month.

3.  `.CALCULATE(_id=customer_id_val, name=customer_name_val, number_of_transactions=num_tx_in_join_month)`: This final step takes the data for the top customer and formats it as requested, renaming `customer_id_val` to `_id`, `customer_name_val` to `name`, and `num_tx_in_join_month` to `number_of_transactions`.",50.910932302474976,"# Step 1: For each customer, calculate their _id, name, and the number of transactions

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(cust_state=customer.state, tick_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection to retain only transactions where the difference in days between the `date_time` of the transaction and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. This effectively selects transactions from the past 30 days, inclusive of 30 days ago.
2.  `transactions_with_country_details`: We then take these `recent_transactions` and use `CALCULATE` to add a new field `cust_country`, which is derived from the `country` attribute of the `customer` associated with each transaction. This step is crucial for enabling partitioning by country.
3.  `country_grouped_transactions`: This line partitions the `transactions_with_country_details` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups records by the unique values of `cust_country`.
4.  `country_transaction_summary`: After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data. For each country group:
    *   `country_name = cust_country`: The country name is taken from the partition key.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: This sums the `amount` from the `Transactions` collection. The `Transactions` here are implicitly those that met the initial 30-day filter and belong to the current country partition.
    *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: This counts the number of such transactions for the current country.
5.  `top_5_countries_by_transaction_volume`: Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` is applied to `country_transaction_summary`. This selects the top 5 records (countries) ordered by `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter DailyPrices for 'VTI' and for the last 7 calendar days (today + 6 previous days)
vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (ticker.symbol == 'VTI') &
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) &  # Ensures date is not in the future

)

# Calculate the lowest closing price from the filtered data
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    lowest_vti_close_price_past_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.
        *   `<= 6` ensures the date is within the 6 days prior to today, or is today itself (0 days difference). This covers a total of 7 distinct calendar days.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final result at the top `Broker` level.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total number of transactions).
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70)`**:
    *   This part filters the `Customers` collection.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in days between the customer's `join_date` and the current date.
    *   The `WHERE` clause keeps only those customers for whom this difference is less than or equal to 70 days (i.e., joined in the past 70 days).

3.  For each remaining customer, calculate the required values:
    *   Select the customer's `_id`.
    *   Determine the date of their first transaction. This involves:
        *   Accessing their `transactions_made`.
        *   Ranking these transactions by `date_time` in ascending order (`date_time.ASC()`) *per customer* (`per=""Customers""`).
        *   Filtering for the transaction with rank 1 (`RANKING(...) == 1`).
        *   Using `SINGULAR()` to treat the result as a single transaction record (assuming ""first transaction"" implies a unique earliest one, or picking one if multiple occur at the exact same earliest time).
        *   Accessing the `date_time` of this first transaction.
    *   Calculate the difference in ""days"" between the customer's `join_date` and the `date_time` of their first transaction using `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, first_transaction_date_time)`.

The final output will include the customer's `_id` and the calculated time difference in days.

```python
result = Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1).CALCULATE(
    _id=_id,
    days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(
        ""days"",
        join_date,
        transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time
    )
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This selects only customers who have at least one transaction. `HAS(transactions_made)` checks for the existence of records in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: This includes the customer's original `_id` in the result.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: This calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This complex expression retrieves the date and time of the customer's first transaction:
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions.
                *   `RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"")`: Ranks the customer's transactions by their `date_time` in ascending order. The `per=""Customers""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer.
                *   `== 1`: Selects the transaction(s) with the earliest rank (i.e., the first transaction).
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the resulting collection (which should contain the single earliest transaction, or one of them if ties exist and `allow_ties` defaults to `False`) into a single record context.
            *   `.date_time`: Accesses the `date_time` field of that first transaction.
The query returns the customer's `_id` and the calculated number of days from their join date to their first transaction. The unit for the time difference is ""days"".",41.86334276199341,"result = Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1).CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Selects transactions from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Selects transactions from January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, this step calculates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from the `date_time` field. This new field will be used as the key for partitioning. The original `price` field of the filtered transactions remains available for aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered and augmented transactions by the `transaction_month`. Each group (partition) will contain transactions from a specific month of Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each monthly group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `month = transaction_month`: The month number (1, 2, or 3) is selected for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: The average transaction price is calculated. `AVG(Transactions.price)` computes the average of the `price` field for all `Transactions` records that fall into the current month's partition (due to the preceding `WHERE` and `PARTITION` clauses).

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%')` checks if the lowercase version of `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. The `%` are wildcards, meaning 'm5' can appear anywhere in the VIN. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' in the VIN.

2.  `sales_count_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `cars_with_m5_vin` (cars that matched the VIN criteria).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars. Each group will consist of cars having the same `make` and `model`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with all cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` of the cars within the partition group.

The final result, `sales_count_per_model_with_m5_vin`, will be a collection where each record contains the car make, car model, and the total number of sales for that model, specifically for cars whose VIN includes 'M5'.",39.74187970161438,"# Filter cars that have 'M5' in their VIN number (case-insensitive partial match)

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: Selects sales records where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`: Ensures that the `sale_date` occurred within the last 30 days (i.e., the difference in days between the `sale_date` and `DATETIME('now')` is 0, 1, ..., up to 29). This covers today and the 29 preceding days.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  Calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` records.
3.  Calculate the number of sales for each salesperson by counting their `sales_made` records.
4.  Assign a sales rank (SR) to each salesperson based on their total sales amount in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will receive a lower rank number (e.g., rank 1 for the highest).
5.  Select the salesperson's `first_name`, `last_name`, the calculated `total_sales_amount`, `number_of_sales`, and `SR`.

Two `CALCULATE` steps are used: the first to compute total sales and number of sales, and the second to compute the rank based on these calculated values and to format the final output fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them to avoid conflicts in subsequent calculations.
    *   `calc_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales associated with each salesperson via the `sales_made` sub-collection. This sum is stored as `calc_total_sales`.
    *   `calc_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson, storing it as `calc_num_sales`.

2.  `sales_data.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call takes the output of the first (`sales_data`) and performs further calculations and field selection.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`: Passes through the salesperson's first and last names, renaming them to the final requested field names.

    *   `SR=RANKING(by=calc_total_sales.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `calc_total_sales` field in descending order (`DESC()`), so the salesperson with the highest total sales gets rank 1.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: We start by selecting from the `Cars` collection and then filter it.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the `make` field contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""NewFord"", ""FordMotors""). `LOWER()` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase version of the `model` field contains ""mustang"", allowing for case-insensitive partial matches.
    *   **`|`**: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains ""ford"" OR its model contains ""mustang"".

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each car that meets the filter criteria, we calculate the desired output fields:
    *   **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective fields directly from the `Cars` collection.
    *   **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car.
        *   `sale_records` is a sub-collection of `Sales` linked to each car.
        *   `AVG(sale_records.sale_price)` computes the average of the `sale_price` from all sale records associated with that car. If a car has no sale records, the `AVG` function will typically result in `null` for `avg_sale_price`.

The PyDough code calculates Per Month Salesperson Sales count (PMSPS) and Per Month Sales Revenue (PMSR) for salespersons hired between 2022 and 2023 (inclusive), focusing on sales made in the last six full months (excluding the current month).

1.  **Date Boundaries Definition (`date_config`):**
    *   It first establishes the reporting period by calculating the start of the current month (`calc_current_month_start`) and the start of the month six months prior (`calc_report_period_start`). These values are calculated once at the `Dealership` (graph) level.

2.  **Salesperson Filtering (`hired_salespersons`):**
    *   It filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those whose `hire_date` falls within the years 2022 and 2023, inclusive.

3.  **Sales Data Retrieval and Filtering (`all_sales_from_hired_persons`, `sales_for_period`):**
    *   It accesses the `sales_made` sub-collection for the filtered salespersons.
    *   These sales records are then filtered to include only those with a `sale_date` falling within the defined six-month reporting window (i.e., on or after `calc_report_period_start` and before `calc_current_month_start`).

4.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   For each relevant sale, the `sale_date` is truncated to the start of its month (`sale_month_truncated`). This standardized month value will be used for grouping.
    *   The `sale_price` is carried over as `price_of_sale` to be used in sum aggregation.

5.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_metrics_calc`):**
    *   The prepared sales data is partitioned (grouped) by `sale_month_truncated`.
    *   For each month group, it calculates:
        *   `PMSPS_val`: The count of sales records (`COUNT(Sales)`) in that month.
        *   `PMSR_val`: The sum of `price_of_sale` for all sales in that month.
    *   The results are ordered by the month (`report_month_val`) in ascending order.

6.  **Final Output Formatting (`final_report_data`):**
    *   The calculated fields are selected and renamed to `month`, `PMSPS`, and `PMSR` as requested for the final output.

3. Calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Compute the average of these day differences across all payments.
5. Round the final average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph to compute a single aggregate value.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue for these sales by summing their `sale_price`.
3.  Calculate the total cost for these sales by summing the `cost` of the `car` associated with each sale.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100.0`.
The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to yield a single GPM value.

```python

# Calculate GPM for the filtered sales

    gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_in_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`:
    *   This line creates a contextless expression named `sales_in_2023`.
    *   It filters the `Sales` collection to retain only records where the `sale_date` falls within the year 2023.

2.  `result = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This initiates a calculation at the top level of the database graph (`Dealership`). This is suitable for calculating a single aggregate value for the entire dataset.

3.  `calculated_total_revenue = SUM(sales_in_2023.sale_price)`:
    *   Inside the first `CALCULATE`, this defines `calculated_total_revenue`.
    *   It computes the sum of `sale_price` for all sales records present in the `sales_in_2023` collection (i.e., sales from 2023).

4.  `calculated_total_cost = SUM(sales_in_2023.car.cost)`:
    *   This defines `calculated_total_cost`.
    *   It computes the sum of the `cost` of the cars associated with each sale in `sales_in_2023`. `sales_in_2023.car` navigates from a sale record to its associated car record, and `car.cost` accesses the cost of that car.

5.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_2023 = ...)`:
    *   This second `CALCULATE` operates on the output of the first one (which is a single row containing `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost`).
    *   `gpm_2023 = (calculated_total_revenue - calculated_total_cost) * 100.0 / calculated_total_cost`:
        *   This line computes the Gross Profit Margin using the GPM formula provided: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.
        *   `calculated_total_revenue` and `calculated_total_cost` (derived in the previous `CALCULATE` step) are used here.
        *   Multiplying by `100.0` ensures that the division results in a floating-point number and the final value is expressed as a percentage.
        *   The final GPM value is assigned to a field named `gpm_2023`.

3.  We use `WHERE(HAS(condition) == 1)` to filter sales that meet this criterion. The `condition` will be on `car.inventory_snapshots`.
4.  From these filtered sales, we select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`.
5.  Finally, we use `CALCULATE` to output the car's `make`, `model`, and the `sale_price`.

2.  `.WHERE(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((is_in_inventory == False) & (snapshot_date == sale_date))) == 1)`: This filters the sales.

    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This ensures that at least one such inventory snapshot exists for the car associated with the sale.
3.  `.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`: From the sales that meet the above criteria, this selects the top 1 sale based on `sale_price` in descending order (i.e., the one with the highest sale price).

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change as follows:

1.  **Extract Date Parts**: First, it processes the `PaymentsReceived` collection. For each payment, it extracts the `pay_year` (year of `payment_date`) and `pay_month` (month of `payment_date`) using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions, respectively. This augmented data is stored in `payments_with_date_parts`.

2.  **Aggregate Monthly Payments**:
    *   It then uses the `PARTITION` method to group the records in `payments_with_date_parts` by `pay_year` and `pay_month`.
    *   For each unique year-month group, it calculates `total_payments_this_month` by summing up the `payment_amount` of all payments belonging to that group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`. The result is stored in `monthly_aggregated_payments`.

3.  **Calculate MoM Change**:
    *   On the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection (which contains one record per year/month with total payments), it calculates the `mom_change`.
    *   The `mom_change` is computed as `total_payments_this_month - PREV(total_payments_this_month, by=(year_val.ASC(), month_val.ASC()))`.
    *   The `PREV()` function retrieves the `total_payments_this_month` from the preceding record, determined by ordering records by `year_val` (ascending) and then `month_val` (ascending).
    *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV()` will return `None` (as there's no preceding month), resulting in `mom_change` being `None` for that first month.

4.  **Order Results**: Finally, the `final_monthly_payments_report` is ordered by `year` and then `month` in ascending order for a clear and chronological presentation.

It's important to note that this query will only include months for which there is at least one payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function for this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` will give the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current moment. If this difference is less than or equal to 6, it means the sale occurred today or in the preceding 6 days, covering a total of 7 days.
3.  Count the number of sales records that satisfy this condition.
4.  Assign this count to the alias `TSC`.
5.  The query will be performed on the `Dealership` graph level to produce a single result.

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start from the top-level `Dealership` collection to produce a single aggregated result.
2.  `TSC=COUNT(...)`: We define a new field `TSC` (Total Sales Count).
3.  `Sales.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Sales` collection and filter its records.
4.  `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`: This is the core filtering condition.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the difference in full days between the `sale_date` of a sale and the current moment.
    *   `<= 6`: This condition ensures that we include sales from today (0 days difference), yesterday (1 day difference), and so on, up to 6 days ago (6 days difference). This covers a total span of 7 days, inclusive of today.

Here's the PyDough code to find cars with no sales records and return their ID, make, model, and year.

The term ""left join"" in SQL is analogous to checking for the absence of related records in PyDough. We can achieve this by filtering the `Cars` collection for entries that do not have any associated `sale_records`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(HASNOT(sale_records) == 1)`**:
    *   We start with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `HASNOT(sale_records)` checks if the `sale_records` sub-collection (which links to `Sales`) is empty for each car. `== 1` means we are looking for cars where this condition is true (i.e., they have no sales records).

2.  **`.CALCULATE(car_id=_id, car_make=make, car_model=model, car_year=year)`**:
    *   After filtering, `CALCULATE` is used to select and rename the desired fields for the output.
    *   `car_id=_id`: Selects the `_id` field from the `Cars` collection and renames it to `car_id`.

    *   Identify the state (`state_name=state`).
    *   Count the number of unique customers within that state (`number_of_unique_customers=COUNT(Customers)`). Since we've partitioned by state, `COUNT(Customers)` here gives the count of customers belonging to the current state group.

**Explanation:**

1.  `PaymentsReceived.PARTITION(name=""payment_method_groups"", by=(payment_method))`:
    *   This groups the records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection by the `payment_method` field. Each group is named `payment_method_groups` internally, though this name is not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for accessing group data.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION` step.
    *   `payment_method_name=payment_method`: Selects the `payment_method` (which is the partition key) and names it `payment_method_name` in the output.
    *   `total_number_of_payments=COUNT(PaymentsReceived)`: Counts the number of payment records within each `payment_method` group. `PaymentsReceived` here refers to the subset of records belonging to the current partition group.
    *   `total_amount_received=SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount` for all payments within each `payment_method` group.

3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_amount_received.DESC())`:

    *   It sorts this collection in descending order based on the `total_amount_received` field.
    *   It then selects the top 3 records from the sorted collection.

1.  Access the `Sales` data. For each sale, retrieve the make and model of the car involved.

3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique car make and model):

4.  Order these car models by their total revenue in descending order.

result = top_5_models_by_revenue
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_car_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to create two new fields: `car_make_val` (from `Sales.car.make`) and `car_model_val` (from `Sales.car.model`). These fields will be used as keys for partitioning. The original `sale_price` from `Sales` is implicitly available for aggregation.
2.  `model_sales_summary = sales_with_car_details.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We `PARTITION` the `sales_with_car_details` collection using `car_make_val` and `car_model_val` as partition keys. This groups all sales by their car's make and model.
    *   Within each partition group (each unique make/model combination), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `make = car_make_val`: The make of the car model for this group.
        *   `model = car_model_val`: The model of the car for this group.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` of all sales records belonging to the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that specific car model.
        *   `total_sales_count = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records within the current make/model group, representing the total number of units sold for that car model.
3.  `top_5_models_by_revenue = model_sales_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: We then take the `model_sales_summary` (which contains aggregated data per car model) and use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 entries. The sorting is done by `total_revenue` in descending order (`.DESC()`), so the models generating the most revenue are ranked highest.
4.  `result = top_5_models_by_revenue`: The final result assigned to `result` will be a collection of the top 5 car models, including their make, model, total revenue, and total number of sales, as requested.",37.36307144165039,"# Step 1: Prepare sales data by adding car make and model information for partitioning.

2.  Create a contextless boolean expression `is_sale_in_period` to identify sales that fall within this defined time period. This helps in keeping the main query cleaner.
3.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection. For each salesperson:
    a.  Calculate `total_num_sales_in_period` by counting their sales (`sales_made`) that satisfy the `is_sale_in_period` condition.
    b.  Calculate `total_revenue_in_period` by summing the `sale_price` of these filtered sales. The problem defines revenue as the sum of `sale_price`.
4.  Filter these results to include only salespersons with `total_revenue_in_period > 0`. This ensures that only representatives with positive revenue in the specified period are considered for the top ranking.
5.  Use the `TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue_in_period.DESC())` function to select the top 3 salespersons based on their `total_revenue_in_period` in descending order.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**: We calculate the start and end dates of the full ISO week (Monday to Sunday) that occurred before the current week.
    *   The start of the previous ISO week is 7 days before the start of the current ISO week.
    *   The end of the previous ISO week is 1 day before the start of the current ISO week (i.e., the Sunday immediately preceding the current week's Monday).
2.  **Filter Payments**: We select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated date range.
3.  **Prepare for Daily Grouping**: For each filtered payment, we extract the date part (truncating any time component) from the `payment_date` field. This ensures that all payments on the same day are grouped together, regardless of the time they were recorded.
4.  **Partition and Aggregate**: We then partition these payments based on the extracted `day_of_payment` and the `payment_method`.
5.  **Calculate Daily Totals**: Within each partition (i.e., for each day and payment method combination), we sum the `payment_amount` to get the total amount received.
6.  **Format Output**: Finally, we select and rename the fields to present the payment date, payment method, and the corresponding total amount.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, two new fields are derived for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: This extracts the `state` from the `customer` associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
        *   `q_start_date`: This determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the sale:
            *   Months 1, 2, 3 (Q1) map to ""2023-01-01"".
            *   Months 4, 5, 6 (Q2) map to ""2023-04-01"".
            *   Months 7, 8, 9 (Q3) map to ""2023-07-01"".
            *   Months 10, 11, 12 (Q4) map to ""2023-10-01"".
    *   The `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records is implicitly available for aggregation in the next step.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`result`):**
    *   The `sales_data_for_partition` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""quarterly_sales_groups"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   After partitioning, another `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_start_date = q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_sales = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific customer state and quarter. The `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records belonging to each partition group.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",55.63689565658569,"# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

3.  To calculate the average DDD for a drug, we look at its `treatments_used_in`.
4.  For each treatment, we first filter out those where the `end_dt` is null, as specified in the DDD definition.
5.  We then calculate the duration of each treatment in days using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`. We only consider treatments with a duration greater than 0 to avoid division by zero and ensure meaningful ""days of treatment"".
6.  For these valid treatments, we calculate the DDD as `tot_drug_amt / duration_days`.
7.  Finally, we take the average of these individual treatment DDD values for each drug using the `AVG` aggregation function.

    )

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Drugs` collection and use `CALCULATE` to output the `drug_name` and the computed `average_ddd` for each drug.
*   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
*   `average_ddd=AVG(...)`: Calculates the average DDD. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug.
*   `treatments_used_in.WHERE(...)`: Filters the treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `(HASNOT(end_dt) == 0)`: This condition ensures that `end_dt` (end date of the treatment) is not null. `HASNOT(field) == 0` means the field is present/not null.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0)`: This condition ensures that the treatment duration is positive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.
*   `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, this calculates its individual DDD.
    *   `ddd_for_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
*   `.ddd_for_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_treatment` value from the inner `CALCULATE` so that `AVG` can operate on these scalar DDD values. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria, `AVG` will likely return null.",39.880926847457886,"avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(

This PyDough code snippet will:
1.  Establish date boundaries for the last three full months using `DermTreatment` as the context.
2.  Filter `Treatments` to include only those starting within this period.
3.  For these treatments, it calculates a `treatment_month_year_str` (e.g., ""2023-07"") and an `is_biologic_treatment` flag.
4.  It then partitions these processed treatments by `treatment_month_year_str`.
5.  Within each month's partition, it calculates:
    *   `month`: The year-month string.
    *   `patient_count`: The number of unique `patient_id`s who had any treatment.
    *   `biologic_treatment_count`: The number of unique `patient_id`s who had a treatment flagged as biologic.
6.  Finally, it orders the results by month in ascending order.",56.766419887542725,"# Define the relevant time period: the last three full months.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_patients = Patients.WHERE(...)`**: This line starts by selecting from the `Patients` collection and applies a filter.
2.  **`HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`**: This is the main filtering condition.
    *   `treatments_received`: Accesses the list of treatments for each patient.
    *   `.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'biologic'))`: This nested `WHERE` clause filters the treatments. It keeps only those treatments where:
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris'`: The name of the diagnosis associated with the treatment is 'Psoriasis vulgaris'.
        *   `drug.drug_type == 'biologic'`: The type of the drug used in the treatment is 'biologic'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: The `HAS` function checks if the filtered list of `treatments_received` (i.e., treatments meeting both criteria) is not empty for a given patient. If a patient has at least one such treatment, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this context).

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This defines the beginning of our 6-month window. It calculates the date corresponding to the start of the month that was six months ago from the current date.
2.  `end_date_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')`: This defines the end of our window (exclusive). It's the start of the current month, so treatments must occur before this date.
3.  `alice_treatments = Patients.WHERE(first_name == ""Alice"").treatments_received`: This line first filters the `Patients` collection to find all patients whose `first_name` is ""Alice"". Then, it accesses their `treatments_received` sub-collection.

1.  Start with the `AdverseEvents` collection, as this is the primary information we are interested in.
2.  Filter these adverse events to include only those where the associated treatment used a drug of type ""Topical"". This involves navigating from `AdverseEvents` to `Treatments` (via the `treatment` relationship) and then to `Drugs` (via the `drug` relationship within `Treatments`) to check the `drug_type`.
3.  For the filtered adverse events, select the required fields:
    *   `description` from the `AdverseEvents` record.
    *   `treatment_id` from the `AdverseEvents` record (this field directly stores the ID of the associated treatment).
    *   `drug_id` from the `Treatments` record associated with the adverse event (accessed via `treatment.drug_id`).
    *   `drug_name` from the `Drugs` record associated with the treatment (accessed via `treatment.drug.drug_name`).

This approach directly filters and extracts the requested information.

```
Explanation:

1.  `AdverseEvents.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == ""Topical"")`:
    *   We start by accessing the `AdverseEvents` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these events.
    *   `treatment.drug.drug_type == ""Topical""`: This condition checks if the `drug_type` of the drug used in the treatment associated with the adverse event is ""Topical"".
        *   `treatment` navigates from an `AdverseEvents` record to its related `Treatments` record.
        *   `drug` navigates from the `Treatments` record to its related `Drugs` record.
        *   `drug_type` accesses the type of the drug.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   After filtering, the `CALCULATE` function is used to select and rename the desired fields for the output.
    *   `event_description=description`: Selects the `description` field from `AdverseEvents` and renames it to `event_description`.
    *   `treatment_identifier=treatment_id`: Selects the `treatment_id` field from `AdverseEvents` (which is the ID of the treatment linked to this adverse event) and renames it to `treatment_identifier`.

3.  **Rank within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`) based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed. The ranking will be in descending order of distinct drug counts (more drugs = higher rank, i.e., rank 1). We'll allow ties, meaning doctors with the same count in the same specialty will receive the same rank.
4.  **Select Final Fields**: Output the `doc_id`, `speciality`, the calculated `num_distinct_drugs`, and the `SDRSDR`.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first determine the relevant 12-month period. This period starts from the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current month and ends on the last day of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is July 15, 2024, the window will span from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each selected treatment, we extract the year and month from its `start_dt`. These will serve as keys for grouping. This step effectively truncates the `start_dt` to the month level as requested.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the filtered and prepared treatments by year and month. This creates distinct groups, each representing one month within our 12-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each monthly group, we count the number of unique `patient_id` values associated with the treatments in that month. This represents the number of distinct patients who received a diagnosis (as implied by a treatment record) during that month.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each monthly group, we count the total number of treatment records. This gives the total treatments administered in that month.
6.  **Format and Order**: We format the year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for clear presentation and order the results chronologically.

The final output will list each of the last 12 months along with its corresponding PMPD and PMTC values.

1.  **Identify Relevant Outcomes**: Filter the `Outcomes` collection to include only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. This ensures that we only consider treatments/patients for whom both data points are available.
2.  **Calculate Average PASI Scores**: From this filtered set of outcomes, calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` and the average `day100_pasi_score` across all included records.
3.  **Apply the D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the calculated averages in the provided formula:
    `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100`.
    We must also handle the case where the average PASI score on day 7 might be zero to prevent division by zero errors.

The PyDough code will perform these steps using the top-level `DermTreatment` collection for global calculations.

```python
# Step 1: Define a contextless expression for outcomes with non-null PASI scores at both day 7 and day 100.
# We assume '!= None' is the correct way to check for non-null values based on PyDough syntax.

)

# Step 3: Calculate the D7D100PIR using the calculated averages.
# The result is a single percentage value.
# We use IFF to handle potential division by zero if avg_pasi_d7 is 0, returning None in such cases.
# Multiplying by 100.0 ensures floating-point arithmetic for the percentage.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `relevant_outcomes = Outcomes.WHERE((day7_pasi_score != None) & (day100_pasi_score != None))`
    *   This line filters the `Outcomes` collection. It creates a temporary collection named `relevant_outcomes` containing only those records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null. This fulfills the requirement that only patients with scores for both timepoints are included.

2.  `average_pasi_scores_calc = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`
    *   This line performs a global calculation using the `DermTreatment` (top-level) collection.
    *   `avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(relevant_outcomes.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `relevant_outcomes`.
    *   `avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(relevant_outcomes.day100_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `relevant_outcomes`.
    *   The result, `average_pasi_scores_calc`, is a collection with a single row containing these two average values.

3.  `overall_d7d100pir_result = average_pasi_scores_calc.CALCULATE(...)`
    *   This line takes the result from the previous step (`average_pasi_scores_calc`) and calculates the final D7D100PIR.
    *   `d7d100pir_percentage = IFF(avg_pasi_d7 != 0, (avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0, None)`:

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to count the relevant adverse events. To do this:
    a.  Access the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for the current drug.
    b.  For each treatment in `treatments_used_in`, calculate the year (`treatment_start_yr`) and month (`treatment_start_mth`) of its `start_dt`. This is done using an inner `CALCULATE`.
    c.  Access the `adverse_events` sub-collection for each of these treatments.
    d.  Filter these `adverse_events` to include only those where the `YEAR(reported_dt)` and `MONTH(reported_dt)` match the `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` of their parent treatment, respectively.
    e.  The `COUNT` aggregation function then sums up all such filtered adverse events across all treatments associated with the current drug. This gives `num_adverse_events`.
3.  The outer `CALCULATE` selects the `drug_id`, `drug_name`, and the calculated `num_adverse_events` for each drug.
4.  Finally, `TOP_K(1, by=num_adverse_events.DESC())` is used to select the single drug with the highest count of these relevant adverse events.

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  Filter these doctors to include only those who have prescribed at least one treatment where the associated drug's `drug_type` is 'Biologic'. This can be achieved using the `HAS` function in conjunction with a `WHERE` clause on the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection, checking the `drug.drug_type`.
3.  From this filtered list of doctors, we need to find the distinct states (`loc_state`). We can use the `PARTITION` method, grouping by `loc_state`.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select the distinct state names.

```python
# Filter doctors who have prescribed treatments involving 'Biologic' drugs
doctors_prescribing_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(

distinct_doctor_states = doctors_prescribing_biologics.PARTITION(
    name=""state_group"", by=loc_state

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `doctors_prescribing_biologics = Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1)`:
    *   We start with the `Doctors` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1` checks if a doctor has at least one entry in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection that satisfies the inner condition.
    *   The inner condition `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')` filters the treatments to only those where the `drug_type` of the associated `drug` is 'Biologic'.
    *   So, this line selects all doctors who have prescribed at least one 'Biologic' drug.

2.  `distinct_doctor_states = doctors_prescribing_biologics.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state).CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)`:
    *   We take the `doctors_prescribing_biologics` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=loc_state)` groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. This effectively creates groups for each unique state.
    *   `.CALCULATE(doctor_state=loc_state)` then creates a new collection where each row represents one of these unique states, with the column `doctor_state` containing the name of the state.

The final result, `distinct_doctor_states`, will be a collection of distinct states where doctors who prescribed biologic drugs reside.",28.130388498306274,"# Filter doctors who have prescribed treatments involving 'Biologic' drugs

1.  **Filter and Flatten Data**: We start by selecting `Treatments` that ended in the year 2022. For each of these treatments, we access their `outcome_records`. From each outcome record, we extract the `day100_pasi_score`, and by navigating back to the `treatment` and then its `patient`, we get the patient's `ins_type` and `patient_id`. This creates a flattened dataset where each row corresponds to an outcome record from a relevant treatment, along with associated patient details.
2.  **Group by Insurance Type**: We then `PARTITION` this flattened data by the patient's insurance type (`ins_type_of_patient`).
3.  **Calculate Aggregates**: For each insurance type group, we calculate:
    *   `avg_day100_pasi`: The average of `day100_pasi_score` values.
    *   `distinct_patient_count`: The number of distinct `patient_id` values.
4.  **Select Top 5**: Finally, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 insurance types, ordering them by `avg_day100_pasi` in ascending order (lowest first).

The resulting dataset will contain the insurance type, its calculated average day 100 PASI score, and the count of distinct patients for these top 5 insurance types.

The approach is as follows:
1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  For each diagnosis, calculate:
    *   The diagnosis name (`diag_name`).
    *   The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score from its associated treatments and their outcome records. This is achieved using `MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`.
    *   The number of distinct patients treated for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`.
3.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The primary sorting criterion will be the maximum itch score in descending order. Diagnoses for which this score is not available (null) will be ranked last.
4.  Finally, select and rename the fields as requested: `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score`.

```python
result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate intermediate fields for each diagnosis
    diagnosis_name_val=diag_name,
    max_itch_score_val=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas),

    number_of_patients=num_distinct_patients_val,
    maximum_itch_score=max_itch_score_val
)
```
Explanation:
- The query starts by accessing the `Diagnoses` collection.
- In the first `CALCULATE` step, we compute three values for each diagnosis:
    - `diagnosis_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis, taken directly from the `diag_name` field.
    - `max_itch_score_val`: The highest `day100_itch_vas` score recorded across all outcome records associated with treatments for that particular diagnosis. This is found by navigating `treatments_for` (plural relationship to `Treatments`), then `outcome_records` (plural relationship from `Treatments` to `Outcomes`), and applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `day100_itch_vas` field.
    - `num_distinct_patients_val`: The count of unique patients who have received treatment for the diagnosis. This is determined by navigating `treatments_for`, then to the linked `patient` (singular relationship from `Treatments` to `Patients`), and using `NDISTINCT` on their `patient_id`.
- The `TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))` function then filters these results to keep only the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking is based on `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). The `na_pos='last'` argument ensures that any diagnoses without a `day100_itch_vas` score (resulting in a null `max_itch_score_val`) are placed at the end of the ranking and are less likely to be included in the top 3.
- Finally, the second `CALCULATE` step selects these three computed values and renames them to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested for the output.",53.51858329772949,"result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(

1.  Define a date variable, `var_start_date_limit`, representing the first day of the calendar month that was 6 months prior to the current month. This will be used to filter treatments.
2.  Create an intermediate collection `treatments_with_specialty_and_date_filter`. This starts with the `Treatments` collection, filters for treatments where `start_dt` is on or after `var_start_date_limit`, and calculates the `doctor.speciality` for each of these treatments, naming it `calculated_specialty`.
3.  Partition `treatments_with_specialty_and_date_filter` by `calculated_specialty`. This groups the filtered treatments by doctor specialty.
4.  For each specialty group in the partition, calculate:
    *   `output_specialty`: The name of the specialty (which is `calculated_specialty`).
    *   `output_num_treatments`: The count of treatments within this specialty group. This is achieved by `COUNT(Treatments)`, which counts the `Treatments` records that satisfy both the initial date filter and belong to the current specialty partition.
    *   `output_total_drug_amount`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments within this specialty group. This is achieved by `SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`, which sums the `tot_drug_amt` from `Treatments` records satisfying the same conditions.
5.  From the resulting `specialty_aggregated_data`, select the top 3 specialties using `TOP_K(3, by=output_total_drug_amount.DESC())`.
6.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the fields to match the requested output: `specialty`, `number_of_treatments`, and `total_drug_amount`.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
        *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` and name it `insurance_type`.

    *   `num_treatments_val`: The total number of treatments associated with the drug. This is obtained by counting the records in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
    *   `avg_drug_amount_val`: The average total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) across all treatments associated with the drug. This is calculated using the `AVG` aggregation function on `treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments_val.DESC())` function to select the 5 drugs that have the highest number of treatments. The sorting is done in descending order of `num_treatments_val`.

    *   The drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date, indicating it's FDA-approved. This is checked using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   The treatment's end date (`end_dt`) is within the last 6 months from the current date. This is checked by ensuring `end_dt` exists, is greater than or equal to the date 6 months ago (`DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`), and is less than or equal to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`: This condition filters treatments where the `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` contains the substring ""psoriasis"". `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive, and `%` are wildcards for matching any sequence of characters.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This condition ensures that the `drug` associated with the treatment has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt`), implying it is FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition filters treatments that ended on or after the date 6 months prior to the current date. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition filters treatments that ended on or before the current date.
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so a treatment must satisfy all of them.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(count_of_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`:
    *   This line calculates the final result. We use the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to perform a `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_treatments)` counts the number of treatment records that remained after applying all the filters defined in the `filtered_treatments` expression.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Determine Target Registration Year**:

2.  **Filter Doctors**:

    *   The condition `(year_reg == target_reg_year_val)` filters for doctors whose registration year (`year_reg`) matches the calculated `target_reg_year_val`.
    *   The condition `(HAS(prescribed_treatments) == 1)` further filters these doctors to include only those who have at least one treatment record in their `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection. This ensures that we can meaningfully retrieve a ""first treatment"".

    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` is used to select and compute the final fields for each qualifying doctor.
    *   `doc_last_name=last_name`: Selects the doctor's last name.
    *   `doc_year_reg=year_reg`: Selects the doctor's year of registration.
    *   `first_treatment_date=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1).SINGULAR().start_dt`:
        *   This expression identifies the date of the doctor's first treatment.
        *   `prescribed_treatments` refers to the treatments for the current doctor.
        *   `RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False)` ranks these treatments by their `start_dt` in ascending order. The `per=""Doctors""` clause ensures this ranking is performed independently for each doctor. `allow_ties=False` means if multiple treatments have the same earliest start date, one will be chosen (typically the first encountered).
        *   `.WHERE(... == 1)` filters to get only the treatment(s) ranked as first.
        *   `.SINGULAR()` converts the resulting single-item collection (representing the first treatment) into a single record context, allowing access to its fields.
        *   `.start_dt` then extracts the start date of this first treatment.
    *   `first_treatment_id=prescribed_treatments.WHERE(RANKING(by=start_dt.ASC(), per=""Doctors"", allow_ties=False) == 1).SINGULAR().treatment_id`:
        *   This is similar to the above, but it extracts the `treatment_id` (referred to as ""_id"" in the request) of the first treatment.

4.  **Final Assignment**:
    *   `result = doctors_with_first_treatment_info` assigns the final collection of results to the variable `result`.

3.  Filter these adverse events by checking two conditions:
    *   The `reported_dt` (adverse event date) must be on or after the `treatment.start_dt`.
    *   The difference in days between the `treatment.start_dt` and the `reported_dt` must be less than or equal to 10. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)` for this.
4.  Use `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: `treatment.treatment_id` as `treatment_id`, `treatment.start_dt` as `treatment_start_date`, `reported_dt` as `adverse_event_date`, and `description` as `adverse_event_description`.

For each such pair, it retrieves the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates of the concomitant medication.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  It filters these treatments using `WHERE(is_placebo == True)` to select only placebo treatments.
3.  It then navigates to the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each selected placebo treatment.
4.  A second `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications. The condition `(DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt) <= 14)` ensures that only medications started on or up to 14 days after the parent treatment's start date (`treatment.start_dt`) are included. `start_dt` here refers to the start date of the concomitant medication.
5.  Finally, `CALCULATE` is used to select the required information for each concomitant medication that meets the criteria. This includes:
    *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the parent placebo treatment (from `treatment.treatment_id`).
    *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the parent placebo treatment.
    *   `concomitant_med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from its own `start_dt` field).
    *   `concomitant_med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication (from its own `end_dt` field).

Each row in the output will correspond to a specific concomitant medication that satisfies the conditions, along with details of its parent placebo treatment.

2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is ""Male"" and `ins_type` is ""Private"".
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This is done by finding the difference in years between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (obtained using `DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages.

1.  Iterate through each merchant in the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll filter their `transactions_received` where the `status` is ""successful"".
3.  Calculate the ""number of distinct coupons used"":
    *   From the successful transactions, further filter those that actually used a coupon (i.e., `HAS(coupon) == 1`).
    *   Count the number of distinct coupon IDs (`coupon.cid`) from these transactions using `NDISTINCT`.
4.  Calculate the ""number of distinct transactions"":
    *   Count all successful transactions for the merchant using `COUNT`. Since each transaction record is typically unique, `COUNT` on the filtered successful transactions gives the number of distinct successful transactions.
5.  Calculate CPUR: Divide the ""number of distinct coupons used"" by the ""number of distinct successful transactions"".
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero. In such cases, CPUR will be 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over the `Merchants` collection and begin a `CALCULATE` block to derive new fields for each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.

        *   `.coupon.cid`: Accesses the `cid` (coupon ID) of the coupon used in each of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique coupon IDs.
    *   `num_distinct_successful_txns_val=COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of successful transactions for the current merchant.
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: Filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were ""successful"".
        *   `COUNT(...)`: Counts these successful transactions.
    *   `cpur_val=IFF(...)`: This calculates the CPUR.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_txns_val > 0, ...)`: Checks if there were any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons_used_val / num_distinct_successful_txns_val`: If there were successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as defined.
        *   `0.0`: If there were no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.

2.  `result = merchant_cpur_data.CALCULATE(...)`: A second `CALCULATE` is used on the result of the first one. This step is primarily for selecting and renaming the final fields as requested.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **`Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`**: Filters the `Users` collection to include only users whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.
2.  **`.notifications`**: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for these filtered users.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each notification, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`: Truncates the `created_at` timestamp of the notification to the start of its week. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_notification = ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: Determines if the notification was created on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). `DAYNAME(created_at)` extracts the name of the day, and `ISIN` checks if it's one of the specified weekend days. This results in a boolean value (True if weekend, False otherwise).
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters these processed notifications to include only those from the last three weeks, excluding the current week. This is done by checking if `notification_week_start` is one of:
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 week')`: The start of last week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-2 weeks')`: The start of the week before last.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-3 weeks')`: The start of the week three weeks ago.
5.  **`.PARTITION(name=""weekly_summary"", by=(notification_week_start))`**: Groups the filtered notifications by the `notification_week_start`. Each group will represent one of the three target weeks.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (i.e., each week) created by the `PARTITION` clause:
    *   `week = notification_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for the output.
    *   `total_notifications = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications within that specific week's group. `Notifications` here refers to the sub-collection of notifications belonging to the current partition.
    *   `weekend_notifications = SUM(Notifications.is_weekend_notification)`: Sums the `is_weekend_notification` boolean flag for all notifications in that week's group. Assuming boolean True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in `SUM` (as suggested by PyDough examples like `SUM(is_active)`), this effectively counts the weekend notifications.
7.  **`.ORDER_BY(week.DESC())`**: Orders the final results by the week's start date in descending order, so the most recent of the three weeks appears first.

3.  Filter these transactions to include only those created within the last 7 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6`. This condition means the difference in days between the transaction's creation date (`created_at`) and the current date/time (`DATETIME('now')`) must be 6 days or less. This covers today (0 days diff) and the 6 preceding days, totaling 7 days.
4.  Calculate the total count of these filtered transactions using `COUNT()`.

"What is the average AMB for user wallets updated in the past week, inclusive of 7 days ago?

The definition provided is ""AMB = average balance per user (for the given time duration)"". The final result should be a single value representing this average AMB, labeled as ""average_balance"".

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter Recent Balances**: It first filters the `UserBalances` collection to include only those records where `updated_at` is within the last 7 days, inclusive of 7 days ago. This is done using `DATEDIFF(""days"", updated_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 7`.
2.  **Calculate AMB per User**:
    *   The filtered balances are then partitioned by `user_id`. This groups all recent balance entries for each user.
    *   For each user group, `CALCULATE` is used to compute `user_specific_amb = AVG(UserBalances.balance)`. This calculates the average balance for each specific user based on their balance entries from the past week, fulfilling the definition of AMB for that user over the specified period.
3.  **Calculate Average of AMBs**: Finally, it calculates the average of all these `user_specific_amb` values. This is done by applying `AVG()` to the `user_specific_amb` field from the collection generated in the previous step. The result is stored in a field named `average_balance`.

```python
# Step 1: Filter UserBalances for entries updated in the past week (inclusive of 7 days ago).

3.  To determine the `LUB`, we look into the `balances` sub-collection associated with each user. These are `UserBalances` records, each having an `updated_at` timestamp and a `balance` amount.
4.  We use the `RANKING` window function on these `balances`. The ranking is performed `by` the `updated_at` field in descending order (`DESC()`), ensuring the most recent balance gets the top rank.

        *   `== 1`: Selects only the snapshot with rank 1 (the latest one).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Converts the filtered result (which should be a collection containing just the single latest snapshot) into a singular record. This is necessary to access its fields directly.
    *   `.marketing_opt_in`: Accesses the `marketing_opt_in` boolean value from the latest snapshot record.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Merchants` collection. The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each merchant.

        *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the amounts of these filtered transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant. If a merchant has no such transactions, `SUM` is expected to yield 0.

2.  `merchant_revenue_data.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` takes the results from the first step and produces the final output.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: Assigns the stored merchant name to the output field `merchant_name`.

    *   `revenue_amount=revenue_val`: Assigns the calculated revenue to the output field `revenue_amount`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition (`ewallet_context_vars`):**
    *   `calc_start_of_target_period`: Determines the start date for transactions. It's set to the first day of the month that is two months before the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be May 1st).
    *   `calc_end_of_target_period`: Determines the end date (exclusive). It's set to the first day of the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be July 1st, so transactions up to June 30th are included).
    *   This ensures the query considers transactions from the last two full months, excluding the current month.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`filtered_transactions`):**
    *   Selects transactions from the `Ewallet.Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters for transactions where `sender_type == 0`, as specified for active users.
    *   Applies the date range calculated in the previous step (`created_at >= calc_start_of_target_period` and `created_at < calc_end_of_target_period`).

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`transactions_for_monthly_aggregation`):**
    *   From the filtered transactions, it extracts the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of `created_at` into `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This effectively ""truncates created_at to month for aggregation.""
    *   `sender_id` is aliased to `user_sender_id` for clarity.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`):**
    *   The prepared transaction data is partitioned by `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This groups all transaction records by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `pmdau_year`: The year of the report.
        *   `pmdau_month`: The month of the report.
        *   `pmdau_value`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(user_sender_id)`. This count represents the number of unique users (senders with `sender_type = 0`) who were active (made at least one transaction) during that specific month.

5.  **Result:**
    *   The final output (`result`) will contain rows for each of the two target months, with the corresponding year, month, and the calculated PMDAU value (which, by this interpretation, is the count of unique active senders in that month).",102.74585294723512,"# Define date boundaries globally.

2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We also need to keep the `user_id` for grouping.

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll calculate the start and end dates for the previous month based on the current date. The previous month starts on the first day of the month preceding the current month and ends on the last day of that same month (or, equivalently, just before the first day of the current month).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated ""previous month"" period using their `created_at` timestamp.
3.  **Identify Successful Transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`. This is a common convention, but if a different status indicates success, this condition should be adjusted.
4.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions that occurred in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (as defined above) within that same period.
5.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We'll ensure this is a floating-point division and handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).

We will use contextless expressions to define the date boundaries and the initial filtered set of transactions for clarity. The final result will be a single value representing the STR for the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `_prev_month_start_boundary`: This contextless expression calculates the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, this will be June 1st, 00:00:00.
2.  `_current_month_start_boundary`: This calculates the first moment of the current month (e.g., July 1st, 00:00:00). This serves as the exclusive upper bound for the ""previous month"" period.
3.  `_transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `_prev_month_start_boundary` and before `_current_month_start_boundary`.
4.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `_transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is `""completed""`.
    *   `num_total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions in `_transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  The second `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `str_value`: Computes the Success Transaction Rate. It uses `IFF` to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero. If there are transactions, it calculates the ratio; otherwise, it defaults to `0.0`. The `1.0 *` ensures the division results in a float.
6.  The final `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `previous_month_str = str_value`: This selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str` for the final output, ensuring the result contains just this single requested value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_creation_date_parts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   It calculates `merchant_creation_year_field` (the year the merchant was created) and `merchant_creation_month_field` (the month the merchant was created) for each merchant.
    *   It also carries forward the merchant's `mid` and `name` under temporary names (`merchant_id_temp`, `merchant_name_temp`).

2.  `merchants_with_coupon_counts = merchants_with_creation_date_parts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step takes the records from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using a `WHERE` clause:
            *   `YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation year matches the merchant's creation year.
            *   `MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation month matches the merchant's creation month.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are passed through as `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val`.

3.  `top_merchant_details = merchants_with_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:
    *   This step takes the merchants along with their respective counts of coupons created in their creation month.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. If there's a tie, one of the top merchants will be chosen.

4.  `result = top_merchant_details.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This final step takes the record of the top merchant.
    *   It selects and renames the fields to match the requested output:
        *   `mid`: The merchant's ID.
        *   `name`: The merchant's name.
        *   `num_coupons`: The number of coupons that merchant created in their own creation month and year.",64.76519584655762,"# Step 1: Calculate and store the merchant's creation year and month.

    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition checks if a user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `notification_type == 'promotional'`: Selects notifications that are promotional.

# Assign the final result
result = monthly_active_user_counts
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`tx_info = Transactions.WHERE(...)`**:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Transactions` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these transactions based on multiple conditions:
        *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Ensures only transactions from the year 2023 are considered.
        *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Filters for transactions where the sender is a user, excluding merchants.
        *   `status == ""successful""`: Includes only successfully completed transactions.
        *   `sending_user.status == ""active""`: This checks the status of the user who initiated the transaction. `sending_user` refers to the related `Users` record, and `status == ""active""` ensures this user is currently active.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` clause creates new fields for easier processing:
        *   `tx_year`: Extracts the year from the `created_at` timestamp.
        *   `tx_month`: Extracts the month from the `created_at` timestamp.
        *   `user_who_sent_id`: Stores the `sender_id`, which is the ID of the user who sent the transaction.

2.  **`monthly_active_user_counts = tx_info.PARTITION(...)`**:
    *   This line takes the `tx_info` (filtered transactions) and partitions it.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_groups"", by=(tx_year, tx_month))`: Groups the transactions by unique combinations of `tx_year` and `tx_month`. This effectively creates a group for each month of 2023 that has relevant transaction data.
    *   The `CALCULATE` clause then operates on each of these monthly groups:
        *   `month_as_date = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", tx_year, LPAD(tx_month, 2, ""0""))`: Creates a string representation of the month in ""YYYY-MM"" format (e.g., ""2023-01""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., '01' for January).
        *   `number_of_active_users = NDISTINCT(tx_info.user_who_sent_id)`: Counts the number of unique `user_who_sent_id` values within each monthly group. This gives the distinct count of active users who sent money in that specific month.
    *   `ORDER_BY(tx_year.ASC(), tx_month.ASC())`: Sorts the results first by year and then by month in ascending order, ensuring the output starts from the earliest month.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Transactions.PARTITION(name=""status_groups"", by=(status))`**:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the transactions into groups based on their `status`. Each unique status will form a group. The `name=""status_groups""` assigns a name to these partitioned groups, which isn't strictly necessary for this specific query but is good practice.

    *   Have a category that contains the string 'retail' (using `CONTAINS(category, 'retail')`).
    *   Have at least one balance record in their `balances` sub-collection (using `HAS(balances) == 1`).
3.  For each of these filtered merchants, we need to find their most recent wallet balance:
    *   Access their `balances` sub-collection (which corresponds to `MerchantBalances` records).
    *   Within each merchant's `balances`, rank these records by `updated_at` in descending order. The record with rank 1 is the most recent.
    *   Use `SINGULAR()` to select this single most recent balance record.
    *   Extract the `balance` amount from this record. This will result in a collection of the most recent balance amounts, one for each merchant that met the criteria.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `status == 'active'`: Selects merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   `CONTAINS(category, 'retail')`: Selects merchants where the `category` field contains the substring 'retail'.
    *   `HAS(balances) == 1`: Ensures that the selected merchants have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (i.e., they have `MerchantBalances` records).
2.  `.CALCULATE(latest_balance_value = ...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered merchants. For each such merchant, it calculates a new field named `latest_balance_value`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This accesses the `balances` sub-collection for the current merchant. It then ranks these balance records by their `updated_at` timestamp in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each merchant. The `WHERE` clause filters these to keep only the top-ranked (most recent) balance record.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should yield exactly one record (the most recent balance), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record.
    *   `.balance`: This extracts the `balance` amount from that single, most recent `MerchantBalances` record.
    *   The result of this `CALCULATE` step is a new collection where each record corresponds to a filtered merchant and contains their `latest_balance_value`.
3.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(median_wallet_balance = MEDIAN(...))`: This takes the collection of `latest_balance_value`s (obtained by `.latest_balance_value` from the previous step's result) and calculates their median.
    *   `MEDIAN(collection.attribute)`: The `MEDIAN` function computes the median value of the specified `attribute` across all records in the `collection`.

What was the average transaction daily and monthly limit for the earliest setting snapshot in 2023?,"SELECT AVG(tx_limit_daily) AS avg_daily_limit, AVG(tx_limit_monthly) AS avg_monthly_limit FROM user_setting_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date = (SELECT MIN(snapshot_date) FROM user_setting_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date >= '2023-01-01' AND snapshot_date < '2024-01-01');",Ewallet,"To find the average transaction daily and monthly limit for the earliest setting snapshot(s) in 2023, we can follow these steps:

1.  Filter the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to include only snapshots taken in the year 2023.
2.  For these 2023 snapshots, calculate a rank based on their `snapshot_date`. The ranking should be in ascending order (earliest first) and allow ties, so all snapshots sharing the earliest date get the same rank. We also select the `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` values.
3.  Filter these ranked snapshots to keep only those with rank 1, which correspond to the earliest snapshot(s) in 2023.
4.  Finally, calculate the average of `tx_limit_daily` and `tx_limit_monthly` from this group of earliest snapshots. This will result in a single row containing the two average values.

**Explanation:**

1.  `UserSettingSnapshots.WHERE(YEAR(snapshot_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `UserSettingSnapshots` collection to retain only records where the `snapshot_date` falls within the year 2023.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation is performed on the filtered 2023 snapshots.
    *   `tx_limit_daily_val = tx_limit_daily`, `tx_limit_monthly_val = tx_limit_monthly`: These expressions select the daily and monthly transaction limits, assigning them to new field names for clarity or further use.
    *   `date_rank = RANKING(by=snapshot_date.ASC(), allow_ties=True)`: This calculates a rank for each snapshot within the 2023 set. `by=snapshot_date.ASC()` orders them from earliest to latest. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple snapshots share the same earliest `snapshot_date`, they all receive rank 1.
3.  `snapshots_2023_ranked.WHERE(date_rank == 1)`: This filters the ranked snapshots, keeping only those that have `date_rank` equal to 1. These are the earliest snapshots from 2023.
4.  `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation is performed at the top `Ewallet` graph level to produce a single row of results.
    *   `average_tx_limit_daily = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_daily_val)`: This computes the average of the `tx_limit_daily_val` from all the snapshots identified as ""earliest"" in 2023.
    *   `average_tx_limit_monthly = AVG(earliest_snapshots_in_2023.tx_limit_monthly_val)`: Similarly, this computes the average of the `tx_limit_monthly_val` for the same set of earliest snapshots.

The variable `result` will hold a collection with a single record containing the two requested average values: `average_tx_limit_daily` and `average_tx_limit_monthly`.",47.0388503074646,"# Step 1 & 2: Filter snapshots for 2023 and rank them by date, selecting necessary limits.

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To determine the average user session duration in seconds, split by device type, we need to perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `UserSessions` collection.
2.  For each session, calculate its duration in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts`.
3.  Group the sessions by `device_type` using the `PARTITION` function.
4.  For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the session durations.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select the device_type.
# We rename device_type to 'current_device_type' in this intermediate calculation
# to clearly distinguish it as the field we will partition by.
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(

    duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)

    avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds) # Calculate average of the 'duration_seconds' field
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create a new representation of the data.
    *   `current_device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` and assigns it to a new field named `current_device_type`. This is used as the partitioning key.
    *   `duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in a new field called `duration_seconds`.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_by_device_group"", by=(current_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `current_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_by_device_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type=current_device_type, avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds))`: This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
        *   `device_type=current_device_type`: Includes the `device_type` (which is the partitioning key `current_device_type`) in the final output.
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_seconds` field (which was computed in the first `CALCULATE` step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. The `AVG` function will operate on the `duration_seconds` values from the `sessions_with_duration` collection, scoped to the current partition.

"Which merchants earliest coupon start date was within a year of the merchant's registration?

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  It starts with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  It filters out merchants who have no coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, it uses `CALCULATE` to retrieve:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `m_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `m_registration_date`.
    *   The details of the earliest coupon for that merchant. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the merchant's `coupons` sub-collection.
        *   Applying a `WHERE` clause with `RANKING(by=start_date.ASC(), allow_ties=False) == 1`. This ranks the coupons by their `start_date` in ascending order (earliest first) within the context of the current merchant. `allow_ties=False` ensures a single coupon is chosen if multiple have the same earliest date.
        *   Using `.SINGULAR()` to convert the result (which should be a single coupon record) into a singular item accessible in `CALCULATE`. This is stored as `earliest_coupon_details`.
4.  After these calculations, another `WHERE` clause filters these merchants further:
    *   It checks if the `earliest_coupon_details.start_date` is on or after the `m_registration_date`.
    *   It also checks if the `earliest_coupon_details.start_date` is on or before one year from the `m_registration_date`. The `DATETIME(m_registration_date, '+1 year')` function is used to accurately calculate the date one year after registration.
5.  Finally, a `CALCULATE` clause selects and renames the fields for the output:
    *   `merchant_id` (from `m_id`)
    *   `registration_date` (from `m_registration_date`)
    *   `earliest_coupon_id` (from `earliest_coupon_details.cid`)

3.  We then filter the `notifications` sub-collection for each user to find any notifications that were created *before* this one-year mark (`notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year')`).
4.  The `HASNOT(...) == 1` function is used to check if the result of this filtered notification sub-collection is empty. If it's empty, it means the user did not receive any notifications within their first year.
5.  Users who satisfy this condition are selected.

-   `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))) == 1`: This is the main condition for filtering users.
    -   `notifications.WHERE(notifications.created_at < DATETIME(Users.created_at, '+1 year'))`: For each user, this part filters their `notifications`. It selects notifications whose `created_at` timestamp is earlier than one year after the user's own `created_at` timestamp.
