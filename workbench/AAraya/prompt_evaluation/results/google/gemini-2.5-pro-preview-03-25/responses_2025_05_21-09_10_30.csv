**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates:
        *   `c_name`: The customer's name.
        *   `num_total_transactions`: The total number of transactions made by the customer, using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `num_successful_transactions`: The number of successful transactions. This is calculated by counting transactions in `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `""Completed""`. **Note:** This assumes that a transaction status of `""Completed""` signifies a successful transaction, as the definition of ""success"" was not provided in the problem description.

2.  **`eligible_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`**:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It keeps only those customers who have `num_total_transactions` greater than or equal to 5, as per the requirement.

3.  **`customer_success_data = eligible_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `eligible_customers` and calculates their transaction success rate.
    *   It selects:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer (renamed from `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculated as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and performs floating-point division. Division by zero is not a concern here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures `num_total_transactions` is at least 5.

4.  **`ordered_customer_success_rates = customer_success_data.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, this step sorts the `customer_success_data` by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest), as requested.
    *   The `ordered_customer_success_rates` variable will contain the final list of customer names and their success rates, ordered appropriately.",30.273539543151855,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer.

1.  Define a list of FAANG ticker symbols: 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX'.
2.  Access the `Customers` collection.
3.  Filter these customers based on two conditions:
    *   Their `email` address must end with "".com"". This can be checked using the `ENDSWITH` function.
    *   They must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the associated `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG tickers. This can be checked using the `HAS` function in combination with `ISIN` on the `ticker.symbol` within the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
4.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions. This count will inherently be of distinct customers because we are filtering the `Customers` collection directly.
5.  The final result will be a single number, so we'll use `Broker.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')

# Filter customers who:
# 1. Have an email address ending with "".com""
# 2. Have made at least one transaction involving a FAANG stock

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_tickers = ('AMZN', 'AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'META', 'NFLX')`: This line defines a tuple (which acts like a list in this context) containing the ticker symbols for the FAANG companies. This is a contextless expression that makes the query cleaner.
2.  `filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Customers` collection and applying a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
3.  `(ENDSWITH(email, "".com""))`: This is the first condition. It checks if the `email` field for each customer ends with the string "".com"".
4.  `&`: This is the logical AND operator, combining the two conditions. Both must be true for a customer to be included.
5.  `(HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))) == 1)`: This is the second condition.
    *   `transactions_made`: This accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
    *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_tickers))`: Within the transactions of a customer, this filters for transactions where the `ticker.symbol` is present in the `faang_tickers` list. `ISIN` checks for membership.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This function checks if the preceding filtered collection (transactions of FAANG stocks for that customer) has at least one record. If it does, `HAS` returns true (evaluates to 1 in this comparison).
6.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(count_distinct_faang_customers_with_com_email = COUNT(filtered_customers))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_customers` contains the collection of customers who meet both criteria.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_customers)` counts the number of records in this `filtered_customers` collection, which gives the number of distinct customers.

1.  **Identify Stock Transactions**: Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only those where the `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
2.  **Calculate Week Information**: For each stock transaction:
    *   Determine the start date of the week it belongs to using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`. The definition of ""start of week"" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the system's date configuration.
    *   Flag whether the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME(date_time)`.
3.  **Filter for the Target Period**:
    *   Establish the current week's start date: `current_week_start_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   Define the date range for the 8 weeks of interest:
        *   The most recent week to include is ""last week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-1 week')`.
        *   The oldest week to include is ""8 weeks ago from the current week"", whose start date is `DATETIME(current_week_start_val, '-8 weeks')`.
    *   Filter transactions whose calculated `week_start_dt` falls within this range.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered transactions by their `week_start_dt`.
    *   For each week group, calculate:
        *   The total number of stock transactions (`COUNT(Transactions)`).

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_start_val`, `start_of_last_included_week`, and `start_of_eighth_included_week_ago` are calculated to define the precise 8-week window we are interested in (last week through 8 weeks prior to the current week).
2.  `transactions_with_week_info`:
    *   Filters `Transactions` to only include those where the associated `ticker.ticker_type` is 'Stock'.
    *   For each of these stock transactions, it calculates `week_start_dt` (the start date of the week the transaction occurred in) and `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (True if the transaction was on a Saturday or Sunday, False otherwise).
3.  `filtered_stock_transactions`:
    *   Filters `transactions_with_week_info` to retain only those transactions whose `week_start_dt` falls within the desired 8-week period (from 8 weeks ago up to last week, inclusive, effectively excluding the current week).
4.  `weekly_stock_transaction_summary`:
    *   Partitions the `filtered_stock_transactions` by `week_start_dt`. This creates a group for each unique week start date within our 8-week window that had stock transactions.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each week):
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date identifying the week.
        *   `total_stock_transactions_in_week`: Counts all stock transactions that occurred in that specific week. `COUNT(Transactions)` refers to the original `Transactions` records that fall into the current partition group after all preceding filters.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions_in_week`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction_flag` (where True=1, False=0) for transactions in that week, effectively counting how many of them occurred on a weekend.
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `week_start_date` in ascending order.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first calculate the start of the current week and the start of the last week. ""Last week"" is defined as the 7-day period starting from `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` up to, but not including, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate their name, the total number of transactions they've made, and the sum of the amounts of these transactions. We'll use `CALCULATE` for this, with `COUNT(transactions_made)` for the number of transactions and `SUM(transactions_made.amount)` for the total transaction amount.
3.  On the result of the previous step, calculate the customer rank (CR). The rank is based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order (highest amount gets rank 1). This can be done using the `RANKING` window function.
4.  The final `CALCULATE` will select the customer's name, the calculated number of transactions, the total transaction amount, and the computed rank (CR).

**Explanation:**

1.  The first `CALCULATE` operation processes the `Customers` collection. For each customer, it computes:
    *   `c_name`: The customer's `name`.
    *   `n_transactions`: The total count of transactions linked to the customer via the `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   `total_transaction_val`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions made by the customer.
2.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the output of the first step (`customer_aggregates`). It selects the previously calculated fields and adds the `CR` (Customer Rank):
    *   `customer_name`: Renamed from `c_name`.
    *   `number_of_transactions`: Renamed from `n_transactions`.
    *   `total_transaction_amount`: Renamed from `total_transaction_val`.
    *   `CR`: This is computed using the `RANKING(by=total_transaction_val.DESC())` function. It ranks customers based on their `total_transaction_val` in descending order, so the customer with the highest total transaction amount receives rank 1. This ranking is performed across all customers.",29.879417419433594,"# Step 1: Calculate per-customer aggregates.

5.  For each ticker symbol group, count the number of buy transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`.
6.  Finally, use `TOP_K` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined 6-month window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month and Year**: For these filtered customers, we extract the year and month of their `join_date`.
4.  **Group by Signup Month/Year**: We partition the customers based on their signup year and month.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month-year group, we count the number of customers.
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month-year group, we calculate the average `amount` from all transactions made by the customers in that group. If a group has no transactions, PMAT will default to 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_boundary` and `six_months_ago_start_boundary` define the date range for customer signups. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gets the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` gets the first day of the month that was six months ago.
2.  `Customers.WHERE(...)` filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is within the last six full months (e.g., if today is July 15th, this includes customers who joined from January 1st up to, but not including, July 1st).
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))` extracts the year and month from the `join_date` for these customers.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_signup_cohorts"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))` groups these customers by the year and month they signed up.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the requested metrics for each group:
    *   `signup_month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", signup_year_val, LPAD(signup_month_val, 2, ""0""))`: Formats the signup year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January).
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers in each `monthly_signup_cohorts` group, giving the Per Month Customer Signups.
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: Calculates the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in each group. `Customers.transactions_made` accesses the related transactions. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, PMAT will be 0.0 instead of null.

The AR is defined as `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.

Here's how the PyDough code implements this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Customer Data**: It first selects customers who joined in 2022 using `Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022)`. For each of these customers, it creates a flag `is_active_flag` which is true (1) if the customer has made any transactions (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`) and false (0) otherwise. This collection is named `filtered_customers`.

2.  **Group by Country and Aggregate**: The `filtered_customers` are then partitioned by their `country` using `PARTITION(name=""country_data"", by=(country))`. For each country group:
    *   `num_active_customers_in_country`: This is calculated by summing the `is_active_flag` for all customers in that country group (`SUM(filtered_customers.is_active_flag)`). This effectively counts customers who joined in 2022, belong to the specific country, and have transactions.
    *   `total_customers_in_country_cohort`: This is the total count of customers within that country group (`COUNT(filtered_customers)`), representing all customers who joined in 2022 and belong to that country.

3.  **Calculate Activity Ratio (AR)**: A subsequent `CALCULATE` computes the `activity_ratio_value`.
    *   The AR is `(num_active_customers_in_country * 100.0) / total_customers_in_country_cohort`.
    *   The `IFF` function handles the case where `total_customers_in_country_cohort` might be zero (i.e., no customers joined from that country in 2022) to prevent division by zero, setting AR to 0.0 in such cases.
    *   This interpretation assumes that for the cohort ""customers who joined in 2022"", ""Number of Active Customers with Transactions"" refers to those in the cohort with transactions, and ""Total Number of Customers"" (in the denominator of the AR formula) refers to all customers in that cohort for the given country.

4.  **Format Final Result**: The final `CALCULATE` selects and renames the columns to `country` and `AR` as requested.

1.  Access the `Customers` collection.
2.  Convert the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
3.  Filter customers where their lowercase name either starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
4.  Further filter these customers to include only those whose lowercase state ends with 'a'.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection to calculate a single aggregated value.
2.  `num_customers=COUNT(...)`: We define a field `num_customers` which will hold the count of the customers satisfying the conditions.
3.  `Customers.WHERE(...)`: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  `LOWER(name)` and `LOWER(state)`: These functions convert the `name` and `state` fields to lowercase for case-insensitive comparisons.
5.  `(STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j') | ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez'))`: This condition checks if the lowercase customer name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'. The `|` operator represents the logical OR.
6.  `ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`: This condition checks if the lowercase state name ends with 'a'.
7.  `&`: The `&` operator combines the name condition and the state condition, ensuring that both must be true for a customer to be included in the count.
8.  `COUNT(...)`: This function counts the number of `Customers` records that satisfy the combined conditions within the `WHERE` clause.",14.145446062088013,"qualified_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter Transactions**:
    The code first filters the `Transactions` collection to select only those transactions that:
    *   Are of `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred within the ""past month, inclusive of 1 month ago"". This is achieved by checking if `date_time` is between `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')` (exactly one month ago) and `DATETIME('now')` (the current moment).

2.  **Group by Ticker Symbol and Aggregate Metrics**:
    *   The filtered sell transactions are then partitioned (grouped) by `ticker.symbol` using `filtered_sell_transactions.PARTITION(name=""sells_by_ticker"", by=(ticker.symbol))`.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol with sell transactions in the specified period), the code calculates:
        *   `total_amount_sells`: The sum of the `amount` for all sell transactions of that ticker.
        *   `total_tax_and_commission`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) for all sell transactions of that ticker.

3.  **Calculate SPM**:
    *   Using the aggregated values from the previous step, the Selling Profit Margin (SPM) is calculated for each ticker symbol.
    *   The formula `SPM = (total_amount_sells - total_tax_and_commission) / total_amount_sells * 100.0` is applied.
    *   An `IFF` condition (`IFF(total_amount_sells == 0, 0.0, ...)` is used to handle cases where `total_amount_sells` might be zero. If it's zero, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors; otherwise, the SPM is calculated normally.

4.  **Final Output**:
    The `result` variable will contain a collection where each record includes the `ticker_symbol` and its corresponding calculated `SPM` for sell transactions in the past month.

1.  **Augment Daily Prices**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. For each daily price record, retrieve the ticker's symbol and extract the numeric year and month from the date. These numeric date parts are essential for correct chronological sorting later.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Group the augmented daily price data by ticker symbol, year, and month. For each group (i.e., for each ticker for each month), calculate:
    *   Average closing price (`AVG(DailyPrices.close)`)
    *   Highest price (`MAX(DailyPrices.high)`)
    *   Lowest price (`MIN(DailyPrices.low)`)
3.  **Prepare for MoMC Calculation**: Take the result from step 2 (which is a collection of monthly aggregates per ticker). To calculate MoMC, we need the average closing price of the *previous* month for the *same ticker*. We achieve this by:
    *   Partitioning the monthly aggregated data by `ticker_symbol`.
    *   Within each ticker's series of monthly data, use the `PREV` window function. `PREV` will look up the `avg_close_price_monthly` from the preceding record (ordered by year and month) within the same ticker's data. If there's no preceding month (e.g., it's the first month of data for that ticker), `PREV` will return `None`.
4.  **Calculate MoMC and Finalize Output**: With the current month's average closing price and the previous month's average closing price, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where the previous month's average close is `None` or zero to prevent division errors; in such cases, MoMC will be `None`.
    *   Format the month as a 'YYYY-MM' string.
    *   Select the requested fields: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and the calculated MoMC.
    *   Finally, order the results by ticker symbol, then chronologically by year and month.

        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions where the month of `date_time` matches the month of `join_date`, AND the year of `date_time` matches the year of `join_date` are considered.

    *   This function takes the collection of customers (each now having the `calculated_total_amount`) and selects the top 5.

2.  **Partition by Transaction Type**: The filtered transactions are then grouped (partitioned) by their `transaction_type`.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Type**: For each transaction type group, we calculate:
    *   `num_distinct_customers`: The number of unique customers who made transactions of this type. This is achieved using `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)`.
    *   `avg_shares_val`: The average number of shares involved in transactions of this type. This is calculated using `AVG(Transactions.shares)`.
    The partition key `transaction_type` is also carried forward as `transaction_type_val`.
4.  **Identify Top 3 Types**: We then select the top 3 transaction types based on the `num_distinct_customers`, ordered in descending order, using the `TOP_K` function.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(cust_state=customer.state, tick_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create two new fields for each transaction:
        *   `cust_state`: Derived from `customer.state`, which is the state of the customer associated with the transaction.
        *   `tick_type`: Derived from `ticker.ticker_type`, which is the type of the ticker associated with the transaction.

2.  `transaction_details.PARTITION(name=""state_ticker_combinations"", by=(cust_state, tick_type))`:
    *   We take the `transaction_details` collection (which now includes `cust_state` and `tick_type`).
    *   `PARTITION` groups these records based on unique combinations of `cust_state` and `tick_type`. Each group is named `state_ticker_combinations`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(customer_state=cust_state, ticker_type=tick_type, number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions))`:
    *   This `CALCULATE` operates on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `customer_state=cust_state`: Selects the customer state for the current group.
    *   `ticker_type=tick_type`: Selects the ticker type for the current group.
    *   `number_of_transactions=COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the number of original `Transactions` records that fall into the current combination of `cust_state` and `tick_type`.

4.  `.TOP_K(5, by=number_of_transactions.DESC())`:
    *   Finally, `TOP_K` selects the top 5 combinations, ordered by `number_of_transactions` in descending order (`DESC()`).

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter DailyPrices for 'VTI' and for the last 7 calendar days (today + 6 previous days)
vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(
    (ticker.symbol == 'VTI') &
    (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) &  # Ensures date is not in the future

# Calculate the lowest closing price from the filtered data
result = Broker.CALCULATE(
    lowest_vti_close_price_past_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.
        *   `<= 6` ensures the date is within the 6 days prior to today, or is today itself (0 days difference). This covers a total of 7 distinct calendar days.

2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final result at the top `Broker` level.
    *   `lowest_vti_close_price_past_7_days = MIN(vti_prices_last_7_days.close)`: It computes the minimum value of the `close` field from the `vti_prices_last_7_days` collection.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the total number of transactions).
2.  **`Customers.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 70)`**:

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Selects transactions from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Selects transactions from January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Filters for transactions that were successful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, this step calculates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from the `date_time` field. This new field will be used as the key for partitioning. The original `price` field of the filtered transactions remains available for aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month))`: This groups the filtered and augmented transactions by the `transaction_month`. Each group (partition) will contain transactions from a specific month of Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month, avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each monthly group created by the `PARTITION` step:
    *   `month = transaction_month`: The month number (1, 2, or 3) is selected for the output.
    *   `avg_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: The average transaction price is calculated. `AVG(Transactions.price)` computes the average of the `price` field for all `Transactions` records that fall into the current month's partition (due to the preceding `WHERE` and `PARTITION` clauses).
5.  `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: The final result, which contains each month of Q1 2023 (that had successful transactions) and its corresponding average transaction price, is ordered by month in ascending order.",59.62124156951904,"# Step 1: Filter transactions for Q1 2023, successful status, and extract the transaction month.

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to include only those cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. We'll use `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards for a case-insensitive partial match as requested.
2.  Partition the filtered cars by their `make` and `model`. This will group cars of the same make and model together.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars), calculate:
    *   The `make` of the car.
    *   The `model` of the car.
    *   The total number of sales, which is achieved by counting all `sale_records` associated with the cars in that group.

```python
# Filter cars that have 'M5' in their VIN number (case-insensitive partial match)
cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))

# Partition these cars by make and model, then calculate the number of sales for each group

    number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)  # Count all sales for cars in this make/model group
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%')` checks if the lowercase version of `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. The `%` are wildcards, meaning 'm5' can appear anywhere in the VIN. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' in the VIN.

2.  `sales_count_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `cars_with_m5_vin` (cars that matched the VIN criteria).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars. Each group will consist of cars having the same `make` and `model`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with all cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` of the cars within the partition group.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to include only sales where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
2.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days, inclusive of the current date. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))` for this:
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30` ensures the sale occurred within the last 29 days or today.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0` ensures the sale date is not in the future.
3.  Calculate the total count of these filtered sales.
4.  Calculate the sum of `sale_price` for these filtered sales to get the total revenue.

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_toyota_sales = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `car.make == ""Toyota""`: Selects sales records where the `make` of the associated `car` is ""Toyota"".
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`: Ensures that the `sale_date` occurred within the last 30 days (i.e., the difference in days between the `sale_date` and `DATETIME('now')` is 0, 1, ..., up to 29). This covers today and the 29 preceding days.

**Explanation:**

The query starts by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
The first `CALCULATE` computes intermediate values for each salesperson:
-   `sp_first_name`: The salesperson's first name.
-   `sp_last_name`: The salesperson's last name.
-   `calculated_total_sales`: The sum of `sale_price` from all sales associated with the salesperson (`sales_made` sub-collection).
-   `calculated_num_sales`: The count of all sales associated with the salesperson.

The second `CALCULATE` then uses these intermediate values to produce the final output:
-   `first_name`: Renamed from `sp_first_name`.
-   `last_name`: Renamed from `sp_last_name`.
-   `total_sales_amount`: Renamed from `calculated_total_sales`.
-   `number_of_sales`: Renamed from `calculated_num_sales`.
-   `SR`: The sales rank, calculated using the `RANKING()` function on `calculated_total_sales` in descending order. This means salespersons with higher total sales will get a lower (better) rank number.

Finally, `ORDER_BY(SR.ASC())` sorts the resulting list of salespersons by their sales rank in ascending order, so the salesperson with rank 1 appears first.",44.05862855911255,"result = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

    *   Finding the most recent snapshot using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_details_with_inventory_status`: We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection. For every sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (`car.make`, `car.model`), the `sale_price` of that transaction, and determine the car's `latest_inventory_status`.
    *   The `latest_inventory_status` is found by looking at the car's `inventory_snapshots`. We select the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`. `SINGULAR()` is used to access the fields of this single snapshot.
    *   `IFF(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots) == 1, ..., True)` handles cases where a car might not have any inventory snapshots. If snapshots exist, we use the latest one; otherwise, we default the status to `True` (in inventory), ensuring these cars are filtered out later.
2.  `sold_cars_not_in_inventory`: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only records where `latest_inventory_status` is `False`, meaning the car has been sold and is confirmed to be out of inventory based on its latest snapshot.
3.  `max_prices_by_make_model`: We then use `PARTITION` to group these filtered sales by `car_make_val` and `car_model_val`. Within each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination), we `CALCULATE` the final output fields:
    *   `make`: The car's make.
    *   `model`: The car's model.
    *   `highest_sale_price`: The maximum `current_sale_price` found among all sales for that specific make and model combination that met the criteria.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code aims to find details and the average sale price for cars that either have 'Ford' in their make name or 'Mustang' in their model name.

1.  **`Cars.WHERE(...)`**: It starts by accessing the `Cars` collection and then filters these cars based on the specified criteria.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`**: This condition checks if the lowercase version of the car's `make` contains the substring 'ford'. The `LIKE` operator with '%' wildcards allows for partial matching (e.g., 'Ford', 'Bedford'). `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`**: Similarly, this condition checks if the lowercase version of the car's `model` contains the substring 'mustang'. This also allows for case-insensitive partial matching.
    *   **`|`**: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'ford' OR its model contains 'mustang'.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each car that meets the filter conditions, this step calculates new fields or selects existing ones.
    *   **`make=make, model=model, year=year, color=color, vin_number=vin_number`**: These expressions select the respective details (make, model, year, color, and VIN number) for each selected car.
    *   **`avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`**: This calculates the average sale price for each selected car. It accesses the `sale_records` sub-collection (which is a list of sales associated with the car) and computes the average of the `sale_price` from those records. If a car has no sale records, `AVG` will typically return `null`.

The final result will be a collection of cars matching the criteria, with each record containing the car's make, model, year, color, VIN number, and its average sale price.",24.887781143188477,"result = Cars.WHERE(

1.  **Define the Reporting Period**: Calculate the start and end dates for the last 6 months, excluding the current month. The period starts 6 months prior to the beginning of the current month and ends at the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Create a Month Scaffold**: To ensure all relevant months appear in the result (even with zero metrics for specific salespersons), we first identify all unique months within this reporting period that had any sales activity globally. This is done by looking at all sales in the `Dealership.Sales` collection, filtering them by the reporting period, truncating their `sale_date` to the start of the month, and then finding the distinct months.
3.  **Calculate Metrics per Month**: For each distinct month obtained from the scaffold:
    *   Identify sales made by salespersons who were hired between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023.
    *   Filter these sales to include only those that occurred within the specific month being processed.
    *   **PMSPS**: Count the number of such sales.
    *   **PMSR**: Sum the `sale_price` of these sales. If no such sales occurred, these metrics will correctly be 0.
4.  **Format and Order**: The month will be formatted as ""YYYY-MM"". The results will be ordered by month in ascending order.

This approach ensures that any month within the last six (excluding the current) that had at least one sale globally will be listed, and the PMSPS/PMSR for the specified salespersons in that month will be calculated (defaulting to 0 if no relevant sales).

- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- `AVG(Sales.WHERE(...).sale_price)` calculates the average sale price.
- `Sales.WHERE(...)` filters the sales:

1. Access each payment record in the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
2. For each payment, find its corresponding sale record using the `sale_record` relationship.
3. Calculate the difference in days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment using the `DATEDIFF` function.
4. Compute the average of these day differences across all payments.
5. Round the final average to 2 decimal places using the `ROUND` function.

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Dealership` graph to compute a single aggregate value.
2.  `AVG(...)`: This function will calculate the average of the day differences.

    *   `payment_date`: Accesses the `payment_date` of the current payment record.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)`: Calculates the number of days between the sale date and the payment date for each payment. This result is named `days_difference`.
4.  `.days_difference`: This selects the calculated `days_difference` from the inner `CALCULATE` to be used by the `AVG` function.

1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  For these sales, calculate the total revenue, which is the sum of their `sale_price`.
3.  For these same sales, calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the `cost` of the cars sold. The cost of each car is accessed via the `car` relationship from the `Sales` collection to the `Cars` collection.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The calculation will be performed at the `Dealership` graph level to get a single GPM value for all sales in 2023.

```python
result = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

)
```
Explanation:
The PyDough code performs the GPM calculation as follows:
1.  It starts with the `Dealership` collection, which represents the top-level graph.
2.  The first `CALCULATE` clause computes two aggregate values:
    *   `total_revenue_2023`: This is the sum of `sale_price` for all records in the `Sales` collection where the `sale_date` is in the year 2023.
    *   `total_cost_2023`: This is the sum of `cost` for all cars associated with sales in 2023. It accesses `Sales.car.cost` to get the cost of each car sold.
3.  The second `CALCULATE` clause uses the previously calculated `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_2023` to compute the `gpm_2023`.
    *   The formula `(total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_2023) / total_cost_2023 * 100` is applied.
    *   An `IFF` condition is added to handle the case where `total_cost_2023` might be zero (e.g., if no sales occurred or costs were zero), preventing a division-by-zero error. In such a case, GPM is set to 0.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to find sales where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `car` associated with each sale.
    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:
        *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change.

1.  **Data Preparation (`payments_info`):**
    *   It starts with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment record, it extracts the `payment_year_val` (year) and `payment_month_val` (month) from the `payment_date` field using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions.

2.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_aggregated_payments`):**
    *   The `payments_info` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_payment_groups"", by=(payment_year_val, payment_month_val))`. This groups the payment records by unique year-month combinations.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each month), `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Output the `output_year` (which is `payment_year_val`) and `output_month` (which is `payment_month_val`).
        *   Calculate `total_monthly_amount` by summing `payment_amount` for all payments within that specific year-month group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.
    *   The results are then ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC())`. This sorting is crucial for the correct operation of the `PREV` function in the next step.

3.  **MoM Change Calculation (`result`):**
    *   This final `CALCULATE` step operates on the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection.
    *   It includes `output_year`, `output_month`, and `total_monthly_amount` from the previous step.
    *   It calculates `month_over_month_change` using the formula: `total_monthly_amount - PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))`.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))` fetches the `total_monthly_amount` from the immediately preceding month in the ordered dataset.
        *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV` will return `None` (or a similar null equivalent), resulting in `month_over_month_change` being `None` for that first month, which is appropriate as there's no prior month to compare against.

The query will return results for each month that has payment records. Months with absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection will not be listed in the output. The final output includes the year, month, total payments for that month, and the calculated MoM change.",62.020028829574585,"# Step 1: Calculate year and month for each payment record.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` will give us the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.
    *   So, we need records where this difference is between 0 and 6 (inclusive).
3.  Count the number of sales records that meet this date criteria.
4.  Assign this count to a field named `TSC` using the top-level `Dealership` collection.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_in_last_7_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to 'now'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is within the last 6 days from 'now' (inclusive of 'now', making it a 7-day window).
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only sales within this 7-day period are selected.
2.  `total_sales_count_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(TSC = COUNT(sales_in_last_7_days))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   It uses the top-level `Dealership` collection to create a single result row.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.WHERE(HAS(sales_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Salespersons` collection to include only those who have made at least one sale. This is crucial because ASP calculation involves division by the number of sales.
2.  `.CALCULATE(s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name, asp_value=(SUM(sales_made.sale_price) / COUNT(sales_made)))`:

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_with_details = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we use `CALCULATE` to retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car via the `car` relationship. These are aliased as `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model` to be used as partition keys.
2.  `grouped_by_model = sales_with_details.PARTITION(...)`: The `sales_with_details` collection is then partitioned. The `PARTITION` function groups the sales records by unique combinations of `resolved_car_make` and `resolved_car_model`. Each group is named `sales_per_model_group`.
3.  `model_summary = grouped_by_model.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, we calculate:
    *   `make`: The car make (from the partition key `resolved_car_make`).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Customers.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=(state))`**: This groups the `Customers` collection by the `state` field. Each group (named ""state_group"" for reference within the partition context, though not directly used in the subsequent `CALCULATE` for `state` itself) will contain all customers from a particular state.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(state_name=state, total_signups=COUNT(Customers))`**: For each state group created by the `PARTITION`:
    *   `state_name=state`: Selects the `state` (renaming it to `state_name` for clarity in the output).
    *   `total_signups=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers within that specific state group. This gives us the total signups for that state.
3.  **`.TOP_K(2, by=total_signups.DESC())`**: This takes the result from the `CALCULATE` step (which is a collection of states and their signup counts) and:

2.  Access the `Salespersons` collection.
3.  For each salesperson, calculate:
    *   Their first name and last name.
    *   Their total revenue during the defined period. Revenue is the sum of `sale_price` from their sales (`sales_made`) that fall within this period.

4.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 3 salespersons based on their calculated `total_revenue_for_period` in descending order. We use `na_pos='last'` to ensure salespersons with no revenue (or NULL revenue) are ranked at the bottom.

    by=total_revenue_for_period.DESC(na_pos='last')
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`: These contextless expressions define the 3-month window. `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` gets the date 3 months ago, and `'start of day'` truncates it to the beginning of that day. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` represents today's date at midnight. The filter `(sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date <= end_period_date)` includes all sales made on or after the start date and on or before the end date.
2.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This operation iterates through each salesperson.
    *   `sales_rep_first_name=first_name` and `sales_rep_last_name=last_name`: Selects the salesperson's name.
    *   `total_revenue_for_period=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales (`sales_made`) associated with the current salesperson, but only for those sales where `sale_date` falls within our defined 3-month period.

3.  `.TOP_K(3, by=total_revenue_for_period.DESC(na_pos='last'))`: This takes the collection of salespersons with their calculated metrics and selects the top 3 based on `total_revenue_for_period`. The `DESC(na_pos='last')` ensures that sorting is in descending order of revenue, and any salespersons with NULL revenue (e.g., if they had no sales or `SUM` resulted in NULL) are placed at the end.
4.

3.  Further filter these payments to include only those where the `payment_date` falls on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). I will use the `DAYNAME()` function to get the name of the day for the `payment_date` and check if it is 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'.
4.  Finally, I will count the number of payments that satisfy both conditions.

1.  **Determine the Date Range for the Previous ISO Week**:
    *   An ISO week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday.
    *   We'll calculate the start date (Monday) and end date (Sunday) of the week immediately preceding the current week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')` gives the Monday of the current week.
    *   Subtracting 7 days from this gives the Monday of the previous week.
    *   Subtracting 1 day from the Monday of the current week gives the Sunday of the previous week.

2.  **Filter Payments**:
    *   Select records from the `PaymentsReceived` collection where the `payment_date` falls within this calculated previous week.

3.  **Prepare for Grouping**:
    *   Extract the calendar day from `payment_date` (by truncating it to the start of the day) to ensure daily aggregation.
    *   Keep the `payment_method` and `payment_amount` for further processing.

4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Partition the filtered and prepared payments by the extracted calendar day and `payment_method`.
    *   For each group (each day and payment method combination), calculate the sum of `payment_amount`.

5.  **Select and Order Results**:

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.
        *   `payment_amount_from_data = payment_amount`: Aliases `payment_amount` for clarity.

3.  `result = payments_for_grouping.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_extracted, payment_method_from_data))`: This groups the `payments_for_grouping` data. Each group will consist of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_extracted` and have the same `payment_method_from_data`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `transaction_date = payment_day_extracted`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_type = payment_method_from_data`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_by_method = SUM(payments_for_grouping.payment_amount_from_data)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount_from_data` for all payments within the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(transaction_date.ASC(), payment_method_type.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the transaction date in ascending order, and then by payment method type, also in ascending order. This makes the output easy to read.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info_2023 = Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)` filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` then processes each of these filtered sales to derive new fields:
        *   `c_state = customer.state`: Retrieves the state of the customer associated with the sale.
        *   `s_price = sale_price`: Makes the sale price available for later aggregation.
        *   `s_month = MONTH(sale_date)`: Extracts the month from the sale date.
        *   `s_year_start_date = DATETIME(sale_date, 'start of year')`: Calculates the first day of the year for the `sale_date` (e.g., if `sale_date` is '2023-05-15', this becomes '2023-01-01').
        *   `q_start_date = IFF(...)`: This nested `IFF` structure determines the first date of the quarter:
            *   If `s_month` is 1, 2, or 3 (Q1), `q_start_date` is set to `s_year_start_date` (e.g., '2023-01-01').
            *   If `s_month` is 4, 5, or 6 (Q2), `q_start_date` is `s_year_start_date` plus 3 months (e.g., '2023-04-01').
            *   If `s_month` is 7, 8, or 9 (Q3), `q_start_date` is `s_year_start_date` plus 6 months (e.g., '2023-07-01').
            *   If `s_month` is 10, 11, or 12 (Q4), `q_start_date` is `s_year_start_date` plus 9 months (e.g., '2023-10-01').

2.  `quarterly_sales_by_state_result = sales_info_2023.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   This line takes the `sales_info_2023` collection (which contains sales from 2023 with the added quarter information).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""state_quarter_group"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`: Groups the records in `sales_info_2023` based on unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the partition, this calculates:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: The state for the group.
        *   `quarter_represented_as = q_start_date`: The quarter start date for the group.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection, as we need to calculate a value for each drug.
2.  For each drug, we will calculate its name and the average DDD.
3.  To calculate the average DDD for a drug, we look at its `treatments_used_in`.
4.  For each treatment, we first filter out those where the `end_dt` is null, as specified in the DDD definition.
5.  We then calculate the duration of each treatment in days using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`. We only consider treatments with a duration greater than 0 to avoid division by zero and ensure meaningful ""days of treatment"".
6.  For these valid treatments, we calculate the DDD as `tot_drug_amt / duration_days`.
7.  Finally, we take the average of these individual treatment DDD values for each drug using the `AVG` aggregation function.

The resulting PyDough code is:

```python
avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    drug_name=drug_name,
    average_ddd=AVG(
        treatments_used_in.WHERE(

        ).ddd_for_treatment
    )

```

**Explanation:**

*   `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Drugs` collection and use `CALCULATE` to output the `drug_name` and the computed `average_ddd` for each drug.
*   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
*   `average_ddd=AVG(...)`: Calculates the average DDD. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug.
*   `treatments_used_in.WHERE(...)`: Filters the treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `(HASNOT(end_dt) == 0)`: This condition ensures that `end_dt` (end date of the treatment) is not null. `HASNOT(field) == 0` means the field is present/not null.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0)`: This condition ensures that the treatment duration is positive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.
*   `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, this calculates its individual DDD.
    *   `ddd_for_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
*   `.ddd_for_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_treatment` value from the inner `CALCULATE` so that `AVG` can operate on these scalar DDD values. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria, `AVG` will likely return null.",41.02698826789856,"avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(

2.  **Filter Treatments**: Select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this three-month period.
3.  **Enhance Treatment Data**: For each selected treatment, determine:

1.  First, we'll start with the `Doctors` collection.
2.  We use `CALCULATE` to retrieve `doc_id`, `speciality`, and compute `num_distinct_drugs`. The `num_distinct_drugs` is calculated by counting the distinct drug IDs from the `drug` associated with each doctor's `prescribed_treatments`. This new collection is named `doctors_with_drug_counts`.
3.  Next, we `PARTITION` the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection by `speciality`. We name these partitions `specialty_group`.
4.  After partitioning, we access the items within each `specialty_group` (which are the records from `doctors_with_drug_counts` belonging to that specialty).
5.  On these items, we use another `CALCULATE` to select the final fields: `doc_id`, `speciality`, and `num_distinct_drugs`.
6.  In this final `CALCULATE`, we also compute `SDRSDR`. This is done using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `per=""specialty_group""` (meaning within each specialty), ordered by `num_distinct_drugs` in descending order (so doctors prescribing more distinct drugs get a numerically lower/better rank, e.g., rank 1).

1.  **Prepare Treatment Data**: For each record in the `Treatments` collection, we calculate two helper fields:
    *   `treatment_month_start_dt_val`: The start date of the month in which the treatment began. This is achieved by truncating the `start_dt` to the beginning of its month. This field will be used for filtering.
    *   `treatment_year_month_str_val`: A string representation of the year and month of the treatment (e.g., ""2023-09""). This is created by combining the year and the zero-padded month from `start_dt`. This string will be used for grouping the treatments by month. The `LPAD` function is used to ensure months are two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January) for correct sorting.

2.  **Filter for Relevant Period**: We filter the treatments to include only those that occurred in the last 12 full months, excluding the current month. This means:
    *   The `treatment_month_start_dt_val` must be on or after the start of the month that was 12 months before the start of the current month.
    *   The `treatment_month_start_dt_val` must be before the start of the current month.
    For example, if the current date is October 15, 2023, the current month starts on October 1, 2023. Twelve months prior to this is October 1, 2022. The filter will include treatments from October 1, 2022, up to (but not including) October 1, 2023, effectively covering months from October 2022 to September 2023.

3.  **Group by Month and Calculate Metrics**: The filtered treatments are then partitioned (grouped) by the `treatment_year_month_str_val`. For each monthly group:
    *   `month`: This is the year-month string (e.g., ""2023-09"").
    *   `PMPD` (Per Month Patient Diagnoses): Calculated as the number of distinct `patient_id` values from the `Treatments` records within that month's group. This counts how many unique patients received a diagnosis (via a treatment) in that month.
    *   `PMTC` (Per Month Treatment Count): Calculated as the total count of `Treatments` records within that month's group.

1.  First, we identify all patients who have received at least one treatment where the drug used was 'Drugalin'. We access the `Patients` collection and filter it. For each patient, we look at their `treatments_received`. Within these treatments, we check if the `drug.drug_name` is 'Drugalin'. The `HAS` function helps confirm if such a treatment exists for the patient.
2.  Once we have this collection of patients, we calculate the average of their `weight_kg`. This is done by using `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to compute a global aggregate `AVG` over the `weight_kg` attribute of the filtered patient collection.

2.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: We group the patients by their ""first treatment year"" and count how many unique patients fall into each year. This gives us the number of new patients for each year.
3.  **Order by Year**: The yearly counts of new patients are then ordered chronologically by year. This is necessary for the next step, which involves comparing with the previous year.
4.  **Calculate NPI**: For each year, the NPI (New Patients Increase) is calculated as the number of new patients in the current year minus the number of new patients in the previous year.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_first_treatment_info`: This line starts with the `Patients` collection. It filters out patients who have no treatments using `WHERE(HAS(treatments_received) == 1)`. Then, for each remaining patient, it calculates `year_of_first_treatment` by finding the minimum (earliest) `start_dt` among all their `treatments_received` and extracting the year from that date.
2.  `new_patients_by_year`: This takes `patient_first_treatment_info` and partitions it by `year_of_first_treatment`. For each year group, it calculates:
    *   `year_val`: The year of the group.
    *   `num_new_patients_val`: The count of patients whose first treatment occurred in `year_val`. `COUNT(Patients)` counts the items (which originated from the `Patients` collection) within each partition.
3.  `ordered_new_patients_by_year`: This sorts the `new_patients_by_year` collection in ascending order based on `year_val`. This chronological ordering is crucial for the `PREV` function used in the next step.
4.  `result`: This final `CALCULATE` step produces the desired output:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `number_of_new_patients`: The count of new patients in that year.
    *   `NPI`: The New Patients Increase. This is calculated by subtracting the previous year's `num_new_patients_val` (obtained using `PREV(num_new_patients_val, by=year_val.ASC(), default=0)`) from the current year's `num_new_patients_val`. The `default=0` ensures that for the very first year in the data, the NPI is simply the number of new patients for that year (as `current_value - 0`).",59.86940383911133,"# Step 1: For each patient, determine the year of their first treatment.

3.  **Apply D7D100PIR Formula**: Use the provided formula: `(avg PASI score on day 100 - avg PASI score on day 7) / avg PASI score on day 7 * 100`.
4.  **Handle Division by Zero**: Ensure that if the average `day7_pasi_score` is zero, we avoid a division-by-zero error. `IFF` will be used for this, returning `None` in such cases.
5.  **Return the Percentage Value**: The final result should be the calculated percentage.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`: This line defines a subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It filters records to include only those where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are present (not null). The `HAS(field_name)==1` construct is used to check for non-null values.
2.  `avg_scores_calc`: This calculation is performed on the `DermTreatment` graph, ensuring global averages.
    *   `avg_day7_pasi_val`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
    *   `avg_day100_pasi_val`: Calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score` from the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi`.
3.  `overall_d7d100pir`: This final `CALCULATE` step computes the D7D100PIR.
    *   It uses the `avg_day7_pasi_val` and `avg_day100_pasi_val` computed previously.
    *   The `IFF` function checks if `avg_day7_pasi_val` is zero. If it is, `None` (null) is returned to prevent division by zero. Otherwise, the D7D100PIR formula `(avg_day100_pasi_val - avg_day7_pasi_val) / avg_day7_pasi_val * 100.0` is applied. The multiplication by `100.0` ensures the result is a float representing the percentage.
The final variable `overall_d7d100pir` will hold a collection with a single row and a single column `d7d100pir`, containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage value.",65.8289520740509,"# Define a contextless expression for outcomes records that have both day 7 and day 100 PASI scores.

    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these doctors.
    *   `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')` accesses the `prescribed_treatments` for each doctor and, for each treatment, navigates to its associated `drug` and filters these treatments if the `drug_type` of that drug is 'Biologic'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1` checks if the doctor has at least one such treatment (i.e., a treatment involving a 'Biologic' drug). Only doctors meeting this condition are kept.

2.  `.PARTITION(name=""state_group"", by=(loc_state))`:
    *   The filtered collection of doctors (those who prescribed biologic drugs) is then partitioned.
    *   `by=(loc_state)` groups these doctors by their `loc_state`. Each group will correspond to a unique state.

3.  `.CALCULATE(state_residing = loc_state)`:
    *   For each group (i.e., for each distinct state identified by the partition), this `CALCULATE` clause creates a result row.
    *   `state_residing = loc_state` selects the `loc_state` (which is the partition key) and renames it to `state_residing` in the output.

1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  Filter out diagnoses that do not have any associated outcome records, as these cannot have an itch score.
3.  For each remaining diagnosis, calculate:
    *   `diagnosis_name`: The name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` found in the `Outcomes` linked to the treatments for that diagnosis.
    *   `num_patients`: The number of distinct patients who received treatments for that diagnosis. This is found by counting distinct `patient_id`s from the `Patients` linked through `Treatments`.
4.  Select the top 3 diagnoses based on the `max_itch_score` in descending order. If there's a tie in `max_itch_score`, the `TOP_K` function's default behavior for ties will apply (which usually means arbitrary order for ties unless a secondary key could be specified, but `TOP_K` takes a single expression for `by`).
5.  The final result will include the diagnosis name, the calculated number of distinct patients, and the maximum itch score for these top 3 diagnoses.

*   `Diagnoses.WHERE(HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records) == 1)`: This line starts with the `Diagnoses` collection and filters it to include only those diagnoses that have at least one treatment record which in turn has at least one outcome record. This is crucial for calculations involving outcome data like `day100_itch_vas`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to compute new fields for each diagnosis:
    *   `diagnosis_name=diag_name`: Selects the name of the diagnosis.
    *   `max_itch_score=MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`: Calculates the maximum `day100_itch_vas` score among all outcome records associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis. The path `treatments_for.outcome_records` navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments, and then to the outcome records of those treatments.
    *   `num_patients=NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`: Counts the number of unique patients associated with the treatments for the current diagnosis. The path `treatments_for.patient.patient_id` navigates from a diagnosis to its treatments, then to the patient linked to each treatment, and finally accesses their `patient_id`. `NDISTINCT` ensures each patient is counted only once.

The output should include the specialty, the count of treatments for that specialty, and the total drug amount.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  Define a start date representing the beginning of the 6-calendar-month period. This will be the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month.
2.  Filter the `Treatments` collection to include only those treatments where `start_dt` is on or after this calculated start date and on or before the current moment.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date_calc = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This line defines a variable holding the start date for our analysis period. It calculates the date that was 6 months ago from the start of the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` would be July 1st, 2024, and subtracting 6 months would result in January 1st, 2024.
2.  `prepared_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Treatments` collection. It selects treatments where the `start_dt` is within the last 6 calendar months (from `start_period_date_calc` up to the current time).
3.  `.CALCULATE(doc_specialty_calc = doctor.speciality)`: For these filtered treatments, it retrieves the `speciality` of the prescribing `doctor` and assigns it to a new calculated field `doc_specialty_calc`. This field will be used for grouping.
4.  `specialty_aggregated_data = prepared_treatments.PARTITION(...)`: This partitions the `prepared_treatments` data by `doc_specialty_calc`. This means all treatments prescribed by doctors of the same specialty are grouped together.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Within each specialty group (partition), this calculates:
    *   `specialty_output = doc_specialty_calc`: The name of the specialty.
    *   `num_treatments_calc = COUNT(Treatments)`: The total number of treatments associated with this specialty within the filtered period.
    *   `total_drug_amount_calc = SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with this specialty in the filtered period.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):

    *   `num_treatments_val`: The total number of treatments associated with the drug. This is obtained by counting the records in the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection.
    *   `avg_drug_amount_val`: The average total drug amount (`tot_drug_amt`) across all treatments associated with the drug. This is calculated using the `AVG` aggregation function on `treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K(5, by=num_treatments_val.DESC())` function to select the 5 drugs that have the highest number of treatments. The sorting is done in descending order of `num_treatments_val`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `DermTreatment` graph to calculate a single aggregate value.
2.  **`num_treatments = COUNT(...)`**: We are counting the number of treatments that satisfy the specified conditions and assigning it to the field `num_treatments`.
3.  **`Treatments.WHERE(...)`**: We filter the `Treatments` collection based on a series of conditions combined with logical AND (`&`).
    *   **`LIKE(LOWER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%psoriasis%')`**: This condition checks the diagnosis associated with each treatment.
        *   `diagnosis.diag_name`: Accesses the name of the diagnosis linked to the treatment.

    *   The difference in days between the `treatment.start_dt` and the `reported_dt` must be less than or equal to 10. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, reported_dt)` for this.

For these identified treatments, the query should return the treatment's ID, start date, and end date, along with the start and end dates for *all* concomitant medications associated with these treatments (not just the ones meeting the two-week condition).

Here's how the PyDough code is constructed:

1.  **Define the Date Condition**: A contextless expression `med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment` is defined. This condition checks if a concomitant medication's `start_dt` is on or after the parent treatment's `start_dt` and no more than 14 days after it. `DATEDIFF(""days"", treatment.start_dt, start_dt)` calculates the difference in days between the medication's start and the treatment's start.
2.  **Select Qualifying Treatments**:
    *   The `Treatments` collection is filtered first for `is_placebo == True`.
    *   It's further filtered using `HAS(concomitant_meds.WHERE(med_started_within_2_weeks_of_treatment)) == 1`. This ensures that only treatments having at least one concomitant medication satisfying the defined date condition are selected. The result is stored in `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`.
3.  **Retrieve Desired Information**:
    *   From `selected_treatments_with_qualifying_meds`, we navigate to their `concomitant_meds` sub-collection. This will include *all* concomitant medications for the selected treatments.
    *   The `CALCULATE` function is then used to specify the output fields:
        *   `treatment_id`: The ID of the treatment (from the parent `Treatments` record).
        *   `treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the treatment.
        *   `treatment_end_dt`: The end date of the treatment.
        *   `med_start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication (from the current `ConcomitantMeds` record).
        *   `med_end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

This approach ensures that if a placebo treatment meets the criteria (having at least one med starting within 2 weeks), then all of its concomitant medications are listed along with the treatment details.

```python
# Define the condition for a concomitant med starting within 2 weeks of treatment start
# This means the med_start_dt is between treatment_start_dt and treatment_start_dt + 14 days (inclusive)

what is average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently?,"SELECT AVG(strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', date_of_birth)) AS avg_age FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Male' AND ins_type = 'private';",DermTreatment,"To find the average age (in integer years) of all registered male patients with private insurance currently, we need to perform the following steps:
1.  Access the `Patients` collection.
2.  Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Male' and whose `ins_type` is 'private'.
3.  For each of these filtered patients, calculate their current age in years. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between their `date_of_birth` and the current date (obtained using `DATETIME('now')`).
4.  Calculate the average of these ages using the `AVG` aggregation function.
5.  Round the resulting average age to the nearest integer using the `ROUND` function with 0 decimal places.
6.  The final result will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to compute this.

Explanation:
-   `DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This is used because we want to compute a single aggregated value over the entire dataset.
-   `Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Male') & (ins_type == 'private'))`: This filters the `Patients` collection to select only male patients who have 'private' insurance. We assume 'private' is the value stored in the `ins_type` field for private insurance.
-   `.CALCULATE(current_age_in_years=DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now')))`: For each filtered patient, this calculates their current age.
    -   `DATEDIFF(""years"", date_of_birth, DATETIME('now'))` computes the difference in full years between the patient's `date_of_birth` and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`). This effectively gives the age in integer years.
    -   The result of this calculation is stored in a temporary field `current_age_in_years`.
-   `.current_age_in_years`: This accesses the calculated ages for the `AVG` function.
-   `AVG(...)`: This function calculates the average of the `current_age_in_years` for all patients who met the filter criteria.
-   `ROUND(..., 0)`: This rounds the calculated average age to 0 decimal places, effectively providing an integer result as requested.
-   The final average age is assigned to the field `avg_male_patient_age_private_ins`.",28.64941716194153,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

1.  Access the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, identify their successful transactions. We'll assume transactions where `status == ""completed""` are successful and that these are typically `transactions_received` by the merchant.
3.  Calculate the number of distinct coupons used in these successful transactions. This will be the numerator for CPUR. We'll use `NDISTINCT` on the `coupon_id` field of the successful transactions.
4.  Calculate the total number of distinct successful transactions. This will be the denominator for CPUR. We'll use `COUNT` on the successful transactions.
5.  Compute CPUR as `(number of distinct coupons used) / (number of distinct transactions)`.
6.  Handle cases where a merchant has no successful transactions to avoid division by zero, setting CPUR to 0.0 in such instances.
7.  The final result will include the merchant's name and their calculated CPUR.

This is achieved using a two-step `CALCULATE`:
*   The first `CALCULATE` computes the counts for distinct coupons and distinct transactions.
*   The second `CALCULATE` uses these counts to compute CPUR and selects the final required fields.

```python
# Calculate components for CPUR: distinct coupons used and distinct transactions for successful ones
merchant_cpur_components = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    merchant_name=name,
    # Number of distinct coupons used in successful transactions received by the merchant

    )

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
2.  `merchant_name=name`: We select the merchant's name.
3.  `num_distinct_coupons = NDISTINCT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed"").coupon_id)`:
    *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
    *   `.WHERE(status == ""completed"")`: Filters these transactions to include only those marked as ""completed"" (assumed to be successful).
    *   `.coupon_id`: Accesses the `coupon_id` for each of these successful transactions.
    *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: Counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions. This gives the number of distinct coupons used.
4.  `num_distinct_successful_transactions = COUNT(transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""completed""))`:
    *   This counts the total number of successful transactions for the merchant.
5.  The second `CALCULATE` operation takes the results from the first:
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name`: Keeps the merchant name.
    *   `CPUR = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `IFF(num_distinct_successful_transactions > 0, ...)`: This checks if there are any successful transactions to prevent division by zero.
        *   `num_distinct_coupons / num_distinct_successful_transactions`: If there are successful transactions, CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the total number of successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If there are no successful transactions, CPUR is set to 0.0.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   `current_week_start_dt`: Calculates the start date of the current week using `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`.
    *   `three_weeks_prior_start_dt`: Calculates the start date of the week that was three weeks before the current week using `DATETIME(current_week_start_dt, '-3 weeks')`. This marks the beginning of our 3-week analysis window.

2.  **Filter Users**:
    *   `users_from_us_canada = Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`: Selects users whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.

3.  **Prepare Notifications Data**:
    *   `users_from_us_canada.notifications`: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for the filtered users.
    *   `.CALCULATE(notification_week_start_val = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week'))`: For each notification, it calculates `notification_week_start_val`, which is the date of the start of the week in which the notification was created. This aligns with the requirement to ""Truncate created\_at to week for aggregation"".

4.  **Filter Notifications by Time Window**:
    *   `relevant_period_notifications = ... .WHERE((notification_week_start_val >= three_weeks_prior_start_dt) & (notification_week_start_val < current_week_start_dt))`: Filters the notifications to include only those whose `notification_week_start_val` falls within the last three full weeks. The range is inclusive of `three_weeks_prior_start_dt` and exclusive of `current_week_start_dt`.

5.  **Group Notifications by Week**:
    *   `notifications_grouped_by_week = relevant_period_notifications.PARTITION(name=""notifications_in_week_group"", by=(notification_week_start_val))`: Groups the filtered notifications by their `notification_week_start_val`. Each group will represent a unique week.

6.  **Calculate Weekly Aggregates**:
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_start_for_group = notification_week_start_val`: Selects the week's start date (the partition key).
        *   `total_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications within that weekly group. `Notifications` here refers to the original notification records belonging to the current group.
        *   `weekend_notifications_count = COUNT(Notifications.WHERE(ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))))`: Counts notifications within that weekly group that were created on a 'Saturday' or 'Sunday'. `DAYNAME(created_at)` extracts the name of the day of the week from the notification's `created_at` timestamp.

7.  **Order Results**:
    *   `final_weekly_summary = weekly_notification_counts.ORDER_BY(week_start_for_group.ASC())`: Orders the final results by the week start date in ascending order for readability.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter these merchants to include only those whose `status` is ""active"" and whose `category` is ""retail"" (case-insensitively).
3.  Further filter to ensure these merchants have issued at least one coupon using `HAS(coupons) == 1`.

**Explanation:**

*   `Merchants`: We begin by selecting the `Merchants` collection.
*   `.WHERE((status == ""active"") & (LOWER(category) == ""retail"") & (HAS(coupons) == 1))`: This clause filters the merchants based on three conditions:
    *   `status == ""active""`: Ensures the merchant is currently active.
    *   `LOWER(category) == ""retail""`: Checks if the merchant's category is ""retail"", ignoring case by converting the `category` field to lowercase.
    *   `HAS(coupons) == 1`: Ensures that the merchant has at least one coupon associated with them. The `HAS()` function checks for the existence of records in the `coupons` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(merchant_name=name, total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons))`: For each merchant that passes the filter, this clause calculates two new fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the `name` of the merchant.
    *   `total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`: Counts the number of coupons associated with each merchant using the `COUNT()` aggregation function on the `coupons` sub-collection.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each user.
    *   `user_uid=uid`: Selects the user's unique identifier (`uid`).
    *   `user_username=username`: Selects the user's `username`.
    *   `latest_balance_amount=...`: This expression calculates the Latest User Balance (LUB).
        *   `Users.balances`: For the current user, this accesses their list of balance records (from the `UserBalances` collection).
        *   `.TOP_K(1, by=updated_at.DESC())`: This function is applied to the user's balances. It sorts these balances by the `updated_at` field in descending order (most recent first) and selects the top 1 record. This effectively isolates the most recent balance record for the user.
        *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since `TOP_K` returns a collection (even if it's a single-item collection), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat this result as a single record context. If the user has no balances, `TOP_K` would return an empty collection, and `SINGULAR()` on an empty collection is assumed to result in a context where subsequent field access yields null.
        *   `.balance`: From the singular, most recent balance record, this accesses the actual `balance` amount.
        *   `DEFAULT_TO(..., None)`: This function ensures that if a user has no balance records (making the preceding expression evaluate to null), the `latest_balance_amount` will be `None` instead of causing an error. This provides a graceful way to handle users without any balance history.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Access Merchants**: We start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  **Calculate Revenue**: For each merchant, we calculate their total revenue.
    *   This involves accessing their `transactions_received`.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those that were `successfully received`. This means the transaction `status` must be 'completed'.
    *   Additionally, the problem specifies to filter for `receiver_type=1` for merchants. So, we add this condition to the transaction filter.
    *   We then `SUM` the `amount` of these filtered transactions to get the total revenue for the merchant.
3.  **Rank Merchants**: After calculating the revenue for all merchants, we rank them.
    *   The ranking is based on the calculated revenue, in descending order (highest revenue gets rank 1).
4.  **Select Output Fields**: Finally, we select the merchant's name, category, their calculated revenue amount, and their revenue rank.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate revenue for each merchant from their successfully received transactions.
# We filter transactions by status 'completed' and receiver_type 1.
merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchant_revenues_calc = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We start with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `merch_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name and renames it to `merch_name`.
    *   `merch_category=category`: Selects the merchant's category and renames it to `merch_category`.
    *   `revenue_value=SUM(transactions_received.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1)).amount)`:
        *   This calculates the total revenue for each merchant.
        *   `transactions_received`: Accesses the list of transactions received by the merchant.
        *   `.WHERE((status == 'completed') & (receiver_type == 1))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `status` is 'completed' (indicating a successful transaction) AND `receiver_type` is 1 (as specified for merchants).
        *   `.amount`: Accesses the `amount` of each filtered transaction.
        *   `SUM(...)`: Sums up these amounts to get the total `revenue_value` for the merchant.

2.  `mrr_calculation = merchant_revenues_calc.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This takes the result from the previous step (`merchant_revenues_calc`).
    *   `merchant_name=merch_name`: Selects the previously calculated `merch_name`.
    *   `category=merch_category`: Selects the previously calculated `merch_category`.
    *   `revenue_amount=revenue_value`: Selects the calculated `revenue_value` and renames it to `revenue_amount` for the final output.
    *   `revenue_rank=RANKING(by=revenue_value.DESC())`:
        *   This calculates the rank for each merchant based on their `revenue_value`.
        *   `by=revenue_value.DESC()`: Specifies that the ranking should be done on the `revenue_value` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Date Range Definition (`ewallet_context_vars`):**
    *   `calc_start_of_target_period`: Determines the start date for transactions. It's set to the first day of the month that is two months before the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be May 1st).
    *   `calc_end_of_target_period`: Determines the end date (exclusive). It's set to the first day of the current month (e.g., if it's July, this will be July 1st, so transactions up to June 30th are included).
    *   This ensures the query considers transactions from the last two full months, excluding the current month.

2.  **Transaction Filtering (`filtered_transactions`):**
    *   Selects transactions from the `Ewallet.Transactions` collection.
    *   Filters for transactions where `sender_type == 0`, as specified for active users.
    *   Applies the date range calculated in the previous step (`created_at >= calc_start_of_target_period` and `created_at < calc_end_of_target_period`).

3.  **Data Preparation for Aggregation (`transactions_for_monthly_aggregation`):**
    *   From the filtered transactions, it extracts the `YEAR` and `MONTH` of `created_at` into `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This effectively ""truncates created_at to month for aggregation.""
    *   `sender_id` is aliased to `user_sender_id` for clarity.

4.  **PMDAU Calculation (`pmdau_calculation`):**
    *   The prepared transaction data is partitioned by `transaction_report_year` and `transaction_report_month`. This groups all transaction records by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `pmdau_year`: The year of the report.
        *   `pmdau_month`: The month of the report.
        *   `pmdau_value`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using `NDISTINCT(user_sender_id)`. This count represents the number of unique users (senders with `sender_type = 0`) who were active (made at least one transaction) during that specific month.

5.  **Result:**
    *   The final output (`result`) will contain rows for each of the two target months, with the corresponding year, month, and the calculated PMDAU value (which, by this interpretation, is the count of unique active senders in that month).",104.11213326454163,"# Define date boundaries globally.

2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We also need to retain the `user_id` for grouping.

5.  Select the `user_id` and this total session duration.
6.  Order the final result by the total session duration in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable holds sessions that fall within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_duration_seconds` (the duration of that single session in seconds) and keeps `session_user_id` (the `user_id` associated with the session).
2.  `user_total_session_durations`: This takes `sessions_with_duration` and groups them by `session_user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each unique user), it calculates:
    *   `user_id_output`: This is the `user_id` for the group.
    *   `total_duration_output`: This is the sum of `calculated_duration_seconds` for all sessions belonging to that user within the filtered range. The `UserSessions.calculated_duration_seconds` refers to the `calculated_duration_seconds` field of the records within each partition group, which originated from the `UserSessions` collection.

This is interpreted as counting user sessions that started within a rolling one-month window ending at the current moment.

1.  **Define the Time Period**:
    *   The start of the period is exactly one month before the current time (`DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
    *   The end of the period is the current time (`DATETIME('now')`).

2.  **Filter User Sessions**:
    *   Access the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   Filter sessions where the `session_start_ts` falls within this defined period (inclusive of start and end).

3.  **Count Sessions**:
    *   Count the number of sessions that meet the filter criteria.

4.  **Return the Total Count**:
    *   The final result should be a single number representing this total count, calculated on the `Ewallet` graph.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_date_period = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: Defines the beginning of the time window as exactly one month prior to the current date and time.
2.  `end_date_period = DATETIME('now')`: Defines the end of the time window as the current date and time.

What was the STR for wallet transactions in the previous month?STR (success transaction rate) = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions,"SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) AS STR FROM wallet_transactions_daily WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', created_at) = strftime('%Y-%m', 'now', 'start of month', '-1 month');",Ewallet,"To determine the Success Transaction Rate (STR) for wallet transactions in the previous month, we will follow these steps:

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll calculate the start and end dates for the previous month based on the current date. The previous month starts on the first day of the month preceding the current month and ends on the last day of that same month (or, equivalently, just before the first day of the current month).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated ""previous month"" period using their `created_at` timestamp.
3.  **Identify Successful Transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`. This is a common convention, but if a different status indicates success, this condition should be adjusted.
4.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions that occurred in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (as defined above) within that same period.
5.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We'll ensure this is a floating-point division and handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).

We will use contextless expressions to define the date boundaries and the initial filtered set of transactions for clarity. The final result will be a single value representing the STR for the previous month.

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the previous month using contextless expressions.
# _prev_month_start_boundary is the first moment of the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `_prev_month_start_boundary`: This contextless expression calculates the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, this will be June 1st, 00:00:00.
2.  `_current_month_start_boundary`: This calculates the first moment of the current month (e.g., July 1st, 00:00:00). This serves as the exclusive upper bound for the ""previous month"" period.
3.  `_transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `_prev_month_start_boundary` and before `_current_month_start_boundary`.
4.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `_transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is `""completed""`.
    *   `num_total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions in `_transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  The second `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `str_value`: Computes the Success Transaction Rate. It uses `IFF` to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero. If there are transactions, it calculates the ratio; otherwise, it defaults to `0.0`. The `1.0 *` ensures the division results in a float.
6.  The final `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `previous_month_str = str_value`: This selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str` for the final output, ensuring the result contains just this single requested value.

    *   `merchant_create_year=YEAR(created_at), merchant_create_month=MONTH(created_at)`: We extract the year and month of the merchant's creation date.
2.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` is then piped into a second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `m_id=m_id, m_name=m_name`: We carry forward the merchant's ID and name.
    *   `num_coupons_in_creation_month=COUNT(...)`: This is the core logic.

        *   `(YEAR(created_at) == merchant_create_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == merchant_create_month)`: This condition ensures that we only consider coupons whose creation year and month match the `merchant_create_year` and `merchant_create_month` (calculated in the previous step for the current merchant).

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filtering and Initial Calculation (`transactions_in_2023_by_users`):**
    *   We start with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters these transactions based on three conditions:
        *   `YEAR(created_at) == 2023`: Ensures only transactions from the year 2023 are considered.
        *   `sender_type == ""user""`: Includes only transactions where the sender was a user, excluding merchants.
        *   `status == ""successful""`: Considers only successfully completed transactions.
    *   `CALCULATE` then prepares data for the next step:
        *   `transaction_year = YEAR(created_at)`: Extracts the year from the `created_at` timestamp.
        *   `transaction_month = MONTH(created_at)`: Extracts the month.
        *   `user_sender_id = sender_id`: Selects the `sender_id`, which will be used to count distinct users.

2.  **Partitioning and Aggregation (`monthly_distinct_users`):**
    *   `PARTITION(name=""monthly_user_groups"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))`: Groups the filtered transactions by each unique combination of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
    *   The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on each of these monthly groups:
        *   `month_as_date_str = JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", transaction_year, LPAD(transaction_month, 2, ""0""), ""01"")`: Constructs a string representation for the month in 'YYYY-MM-01' format (e.g., ""2023-01-01""). `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., '01' for January).
        *   `num_distinct_users = NDISTINCT(Transactions.user_sender_id)`: Counts the number of unique `user_sender_id` values within each monthly group. `Transactions.user_sender_id` refers to the `user_sender_id` field of the transactions belonging to the current month's partition.
    *   `ORDER_BY(transaction_year.ASC(), transaction_month.ASC())`: Sorts the results chronologically by year and then by month.

For these countries, we need to return the country name, the count of distinct users who sent transactions from that country, and the total transaction amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Detail User Transactions**:
    *   It starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only those where `sender_type == 0`, indicating the sender is a user.
    *   For these filtered transactions, it uses `CALCULATE` to extract:
        *   `transaction_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
        *   `origin_country`: The `country` of the `sending_user`.
        *   `sending_user_id`: The `uid` of the `sending_user`, which will be used to count distinct users.
    *   This step results in a collection (`user_transactions_details`) where each row represents a user-sent transaction with its amount and the sender's country and ID.

2.  **Group Transactions by Country**:
    *   The `user_transactions_details` collection is then partitioned by `origin_country` using `PARTITION`. This groups all transactions based on the country of the sending user.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates per Country**:
    *   For each country group created by the partition, `CALCULATE` is used to compute the required aggregates:
        *   `country`: The name of the country (from `origin_country`).
        *   `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent`: The count of unique `sending_user_id` values within that country's transaction group, obtained using `NDISTINCT`.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all `transaction_amount` values for transactions originating from that country, obtained using `SUM`.

4.  **Identify Top 5 Countries**:
    *   The `country_level_summary` (which contains the aggregated data per country) is then processed by `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`. This selects the top 5 countries, ordered in descending order by their `total_transaction_amount`.

5.  **Final Result**:

6.  Use `TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` to select the top 2 merchants based on the descending order of their total transaction amount.
7.  The final result will include the merchant's name, their total number of qualifying transactions, and their total transaction amount from these transactions.
8.  An initial `WHERE(HAS(...) == 1)` clause is used on the `Merchants` collection to ensure that we only process merchants who have at least one transaction meeting the specified criteria.

```python
top_merchants_by_recent_transactions = Merchants.WHERE(
    HAS(transactions_received.WHERE(
        (DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150) & (receiver_type == 1)

    ))
).TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())
```
**Explanation:**

*   `Merchants.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Merchants` collection. The `HAS(...) == 1` condition ensures that we only consider merchants who have at least one transaction received that meets the subsequent criteria.
*   `transactions_received.WHERE(...)`: For each merchant, we look at their received transactions. This sub-collection is filtered.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 150`: This condition filters transactions to include only those created within the last 150 days (inclusive of 150 days ago) relative to the current date and time (`DATETIME('now')`).
    *   `receiver_type == 1`: This condition filters transactions where the `receiver_type` field on the transaction record is 1.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: After filtering merchants, we calculate the required fields:
    *   `merchant_name=name`: Selects the merchant's name.
    *   `total_transaction_amount=SUM(...)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions that met the date and `receiver_type` criteria for that merchant.
    *   `total_num_transactions=COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of transactions that met the date and `receiver_type` criteria for that merchant.
*   `.TOP_K(2, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the results from the `CALCULATE` step, sorts them in descending order based on `total_transaction_amount`, and returns the top 2 merchants.",34.02748441696167,"top_merchants_by_recent_transactions = Merchants.WHERE(

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection. We filter them based on three conditions:
    *   Their `status` must be ""active"".
    *   Their `category` must contain the string ""retail"". We use `LOWER()` on the category and search for ""retail"" to ensure case-insensitivity.
    *   They must have at least one balance record. We use `HAS(balances) == 1` for this.

2.  **Determine the Latest Balance for Each Filtered Merchant**: For each merchant that meets the above criteria, we need to find their most recent wallet balance.
    *   Each merchant has a `balances` sub-collection (which are `MerchantBalances` records). Each record in this sub-collection has a `balance` amount and an `updated_at` timestamp.
    *   To find the latest balance, we use the `RANKING` window function on the `balances` sub-collection for each merchant. We rank these balance records by `updated_at` in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each merchant.
    *   We select the balance record where the rank is 1 (i.e., the most recent). `allow_ties=False` is the default, ensuring a single top record even if timestamps are identical (though this is unlikely for timestamps).
    *   `SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of the `WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)` clause as a single record, from which we extract the `balance` value.
    *   This latest balance is stored in a new calculated field, let's call it `current_merchant_balance`. This step results in a new collection (`merchants_with_latest_balance`) where each record represents a filtered merchant and includes their `current_merchant_balance`.

3.  **Calculate the Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` aggregation function is used on the `current_merchant_balance` attribute of the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection.
    *   This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` (graph) level to produce a single output value representing the overall median.

```python
# Step 1: Filter merchants who are active, in 'retail' category, and have balance records.
active_retail_merchants_with_balances = Merchants.WHERE(
    (status == ""active"") &
    CONTAINS(LOWER(category), ""retail"") &
    (HAS(balances) == 1)

# Step 2: For each filtered merchant, calculate their most recent balance.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `active_retail_merchants_with_balances`: This line filters the `Merchants` collection. It keeps only those merchants who are `active`, whose `category` (converted to lowercase) `CONTAINS` ""retail"", and who have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (`HAS(balances) == 1`).
2.  `merchants_with_latest_balance`: This line takes the previously filtered merchants and, for each one, calculates a new field `current_merchant_balance`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This part processes the `balances` sub-collection of each merchant. `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns a rank to each balance entry based on its `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (most recent first). The ranking is done `per=""Merchants""`, meaning it's reset for each merchant. We then filter for the entry with rank 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR().balance`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should identify a single latest balance entry per merchant, `SINGULAR()` converts this to a single record context, and `.balance` extracts the actual balance amount.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step calculates the overall median.
    *   `MEDIAN(merchants_with_latest_balance.current_merchant_balance)`: This computes the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values collected from the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection. If any merchant had no balances (though filtered out by `HAS(balances)`), or if the `current_merchant_balance` ended up null for any reason, `MEDIAN` would ignore these null values.
    *   The result is stored in a field named `median_wallet_balance` within a single-row collection derived from `Ewallet` (the top-level graph object).",68.14700126647949,"# Step 1: Filter merchants who are active, in 'retail' category, and have balance records.

1.  Access the `UserSessions` collection, which contains information about user sessions, including `session_start_ts`, `session_end_ts`, and `device_type`.
2.  Partition the `UserSessions` data by `device_type`. This will group all sessions that occurred on the same type of device.
3.  For each `device_type` group:
    a.  Calculate the duration of each individual session in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function: `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. This expression will be evaluated for each session within the current `device_type` group.
    b.  Compute the average of these calculated session durations using the `AVG` aggregation function.

**Explanation:**

*   `UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_group"", by=(device_type))`: This part of the query takes the `UserSessions` collection and groups its records based on the unique values of the `device_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `device_group`.

        *   `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", UserSessions.session_start_ts, UserSessions.session_end_ts)`: For each user session record (`UserSessions`) within the current `device_type` group, this expression calculates the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` in seconds, effectively giving the duration of that specific session.
