**Explanation:**

1.  **`customer_stats = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   For each customer, it calculates:
        *   `c_name`: The customer's name.
        *   `num_total_transactions`: The total number of transactions made by the customer, using `COUNT(transactions_made)`.
        *   `num_successful_transactions`: The number of successful transactions. This is calculated by counting transactions in `transactions_made` where the `status` field is equal to `""Completed""`. **Note:** This assumes that a transaction status of `""Completed""` signifies a successful transaction, as the definition of ""success"" was not provided in the problem description.

2.  **`eligible_customers = customer_stats.WHERE(num_total_transactions >= 5)`**:
    *   This step filters the results from the previous `CALCULATE` operation.
    *   It keeps only those customers who have `num_total_transactions` greater than or equal to 5, as per the requirement.

3.  **`customer_success_data = eligible_customers.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This step takes the `eligible_customers` and calculates their transaction success rate.
    *   It selects:
        *   `customer_name`: The name of the customer (renamed from `c_name`).
        *   `success_rate`: Calculated as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and performs floating-point division. Division by zero is not a concern here because the preceding `WHERE` clause ensures `num_total_transactions` is at least 5.

4.  **`ordered_customer_success_rates = customer_success_data.ORDER_BY(success_rate.ASC())`**:
    *   Finally, this step sorts the `customer_success_data` by the `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest), as requested.
    *   The `ordered_customer_success_rates` variable will contain the final list of customer names and their success rates, ordered appropriately.",27.047354221343998,"# Calculate total and successful transactions for each customer.

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Filter the `Customers` collection based on two conditions:
    *   The customer's `email` must end with "".com"".
    *   The customer must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
3.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions.

We will use a contextless expression to define the FAANG symbols for clarity. Then, we will filter the `Customers` collection using `WHERE` with combined conditions. The `ENDSWITH` function will check the email, and `HAS` combined with `ISIN` will check for FAANG stock transactions. Finally, `Broker.CALCULATE` with `COUNT` will give the total number of such distinct customers.

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols_list = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols_list`, containing the ticker symbols for FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_with_faang_trades = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the `email` field of a customer ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols_list))) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction related to FAANG stocks.
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols_list))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through the `ticker` relationship from `Transactions` to `Tickers`) is present in the `faang_symbols_list`.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Returns true if the filtered list of transactions is not empty (i.e., the customer has made at least one FAANG stock transaction).
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers satisfying both are included.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_faang_buyers_with_com_email = COUNT(customers_with_faang_trades))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   It uses the top-level `Broker` collection to perform a calculation.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE((join_date >= ""2023-01-01"") & (status == ""Active""))`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):

        *   `status == ""Active""`: Selects customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result `filtered_customers` is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., they are TAC as per the definition).

2.  **`tac_by_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: Calculate the start of the current week and the start of the week 8 weeks prior to the current week. This defines our 8-week analysis window.
2.  **Process Transactions**:
    *   Filter all transactions to include only those related to 'STOCK' tickers. (Note: 'STOCK' is assumed as the value for stock `ticker_type`. This might need adjustment based on actual data.)
    *   For each relevant transaction, determine its week's start date using `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`.
    *   Identify if the transaction occurred on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) using `DAYNAME()` and `ISIN()`.
3.  **Filter for the 8-Week Period**: Select transactions whose calculated week start date falls within our defined 8-week window (i.e., greater than or equal to the start of the 8th week ago, and less than the start of the current week).
4.  **Group and Aggregate**:
    *   Group these filtered transactions by their `transaction_week_start`.
    *   For each week, count the total number of stock transactions.
    *   For each week, sum the weekend indicators to count transactions that happened on a weekend.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries`: We first establish the time frame. `current_week_start_date` marks the beginning of the current week. `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` marks the beginning of the week that started 8 weeks before the current week (e.g., if current week is W, this is start of W-8).
2.  `processed_transactions`:
    *   We start with `Broker.Transactions`.
    *   `WHERE(ticker.ticker_type == 'STOCK')`: Filters transactions to include only those where the associated ticker is of type 'STOCK'. You may need to adjust 'STOCK' if the actual `ticker_type` value for stocks is different.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `transaction_week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: For each transaction, this calculates the date of the Monday (or configured start of week) of the week it occurred in.
        *   `is_weekend_transaction = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean field that is `True` if the transaction date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.
3.  `transactions_in_period`: This filters `processed_transactions` to include only those whose `transaction_week_start` is on or after `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` and before `current_week_start_date`. This effectively selects transactions from the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_stock_summary`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the `transactions_in_period` by the `transaction_week_start`. Each group represents one week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_start_display = transaction_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for display.
        *   `total_stock_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction` boolean values. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in a sum, this counts transactions that occurred on a weekend.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start_display.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the week start date.
5.  `result = weekly_stock_summary`: Assigns the final computed table to `result`. This table will have one row for each of the last 8 weeks (that had stock transactions), showing the week's start date, the total count of stock transactions for that week, and the count of those that occurred on a weekend.",46.75173568725586,"# Step 1: Define date boundaries for the analysis period.

""Last week"" is defined as the 7-day period starting from `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')` up to, but not including, `DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`. These will be calculated as global values.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection. Each transaction is filtered based on two conditions:
    *   The transaction's associated customer must be from the ""USA"" (i.e., `customer.country == ""USA""`).
    *   The transaction's `date_time` must fall within the calculated ""last week"" period.
3.  **Aggregate Results**: The collection of filtered transactions is then used to calculate:
    *   The total number of such transactions using `COUNT()`.
    *   The sum of their `amount` using `SUM()`.
4.  **Return Values**: The final result will be a single record containing the `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` level, as it involves global date calculations and aggregation over a subset of all transactions.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This initializes two calculated values:
    *   `calc_start_curr_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the current week.
    *   `calc_start_last_wk`: The timestamp representing the beginning of the week prior to the current week.
2.  `.Transactions`: We then access the main `Transactions` collection.
3.  `.WHERE(...)`: This filters the transactions:
    *   `customer.country == ""USA""`: Ensures that the customer associated with the transaction is from the USA.
    *   `(date_time >= calc_start_last_wk) & (date_time < calc_start_curr_wk)`: Ensures the transaction's `date_time` falls within the ""last week"" period (inclusive of the start of last week, exclusive of the start of the current week).
4.  The result of this operation, `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa`, is an intermediate collection containing all transactions that meet these criteria.
5.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final calculation operates on the `Broker` scope again:
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(filtered_transactions_last_week_usa)`: Counts the number of records in the `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa` collection.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(filtered_transactions_last_week_usa.amount)`: Sums the `amount` field from all transactions in the `filtered_transactions_last_week_usa` collection.

    *   Select the customer's `name` and alias it as `customer_name`.
    *   Calculate the total number of transactions for each customer using `COUNT(transactions_made)` and alias it as `num_transactions`.

3.  In the second `CALCULATE` step, we will:
    *   Include the `customer_name`, `num_transactions`, and `total_trans_amount` fields from the previous step.
    *   Calculate the `CR` (Customer Rank) using the `RANKING()` window function. The rank will be based on `total_trans_amount` in descending order. We'll set `allow_ties=True` so that customers with the same total transaction amount receive the same rank (standard ranking behavior).

*   `CR` is determined by the `RANKING()` function, which ranks customers based on their `total_trans_amount`. `total_trans_amount.DESC()` ensures that customers with higher total transaction amounts get lower (better) rank numbers. `allow_ties=True` ensures that if multiple customers have the same total transaction amount, they will share the same rank.",39.1142783164978,"# Calculate basic aggregates: customer name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount for each customer.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need to identify customers whose `join_date` falls within the last 6 full months prior to the current month.
    *   `start_of_current_month`: This will be the first day of the current month.
    *   `start_of_lookback_period`: This will be the first day of the month, 6 months prior to the current month.
    *   The relevant `join_date` range will be `>= start_of_lookback_period` and `< start_of_current_month`.

2.  **Prepare Customer Data**:
    *   Filter `Customers` based on the `join_date` falling into the defined time window.
    *   For these customers, extract the year and month of their `join_date` to be used for grouping. Let's call these `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`.

3.  **Partition by Signup Month**:
    *   Group the filtered customers by `signup_yr` and `signup_mth` using the `PARTITION` function.

4.  **Calculate Metrics (PMCS and PMAT)**:
    *   For each group (i.e., each signup month):
        *   **PMCS**: Count the number of customers in that group. This can be done using `COUNT(Customers)`.
        *   **PMAT**: Calculate the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in that group. This can be done using `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This will average over all individual transaction amounts from the customers who signed up in that specific month.

5.  **Order Results**: Optionally, order the results by signup year and month for better readability.

```python
# Define the time window boundaries using contextless expressions
start_of_current_month = DATETIME('now', 'start of month')
start_of_lookback_period = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `start_of_current_month` and `start_of_lookback_period`: These variables define the date range for customer signups. `start_of_lookback_period` marks the beginning of the 6-month window (e.g., if today is July 15th, this would be January 1st). `start_of_current_month` marks the end of this window (exclusive, e.g., July 1st).
2.  `customers_with_signup_info`: We first access the `Customers` collection and use `CALCULATE` to add new fields `signup_yr` (year of join date) and `signup_mth` (month of join date), while also keeping `cust_join_date` (the original join date) for filtering.
3.  `filtered_customers_for_period`: This step filters the augmented customer data to include only those customers whose `cust_join_date` falls within our defined 6-month window.
4.  `customer_signup_monthly_groups`: The filtered customers are then partitioned into groups based on their `signup_yr` and `signup_mth`. Each group represents a cohort of customers who signed up in the same month.
5.  `monthly_metrics`: For each `monthly_signup_cohort` (partition):
    *   `signup_year` and `signup_month` are carried over from the partition keys.
    *   `pmcs` (Per Month Customer Signups) is calculated as `COUNT(Customers)`, which counts the number of customers in the current signup cohort.
    *   `pmat` (Per Month Average Transaction Amount) is calculated as `AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount)`. This takes all transactions made by the customers in the current signup cohort and computes the average of their `amount` values.

AR = (Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100.

The calculation is restricted to customers who joined in 2022.
Based on the database schema, `Customers` have a `join_date` and a `status` field. It's a straightforward interpretation to consider ""Active Customers"" as those having `status == 'Active'`. ""With Transactions"" means customers who have associated records in `transactions_made`.

Here's the step-by-step derivation:
1.  Filter `Customers` to include only those who joined in 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`).
2.  For this group of customers, we need to determine:
    *   **Numerator for AR**: The number of customers who have `status == 'Active'` AND have at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made)==1`).
    *   **Denominator for AR**: The total number of customers who have at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made)==1`).
3.  These counts will be calculated per country.
4.  The AR is then computed using the formula, handling cases where the denominator might be zero.

The PyDough code will be:
1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter for customers who joined in the year 2022.
3.  In the same step or a subsequent `CALCULATE`, create boolean flags:
    *   `calc_has_txn`: True if the customer has transactions.
    *   `calc_is_active_and_has_txn`: True if the customer's status is 'Active' AND they have transactions.
    *   Also, select the `country` for partitioning.
4.  Partition the resulting data by `country`.
5.  In a `CALCULATE` step after partitioning, sum the boolean flags to get the counts for the numerator and denominator for each country.
    *   `numerator_val = SUM(calc_is_active_and_has_txn)`
    *   `denominator_val = SUM(calc_has_txn)`
6.  Calculate the AR, ensuring to handle division by zero (if `denominator_val` is 0, AR is 0).
7.  Select the final `country` and `AR` fields.

```python
# Step 1: Filter customers who joined in 2022 and prepare flags for AR calculation
customers_joined_2022_details = Customers.WHERE(YEAR(join_date) == 2022).CALCULATE(
    cust_country_attr=country,
    # Flag for numerator: customer is active by status AND has transactions
    is_active_with_txn_flag=((status == 'Active') & (HAS(transactions_made)==1)),
    # Flag for denominator: customer has transactions
    has_txn_flag=(HAS(transactions_made)==1)
)

# Step 2: Partition by country
country_grouped_data = customers_joined_2022_details.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(cust_country_attr))

# Step 3: Calculate AR components and AR for each country

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `customers_joined_2022_details`: This line filters the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022 (`YEAR(join_date) == 2022`). It then calculates three new attributes for these customers:
    *   `cust_country_attr`: The country of the customer, which will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_active_with_txn_flag`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the customer's `status` is 'Active' and they have at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made)==1`). This corresponds to the customers counted in the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `has_txn_flag`: A boolean flag that is `True` if the customer has at least one transaction. This corresponds to the customers counted in the denominator of the AR formula.

2.  `country_grouped_data`: This line partitions the data from the previous step by `cust_country_attr`. This means subsequent calculations will be performed for each country group.

3.  `ar_by_country_calc`: For each country group created by the partition:
    *   `country_name_output`: The name of the country.
    *   `numerator_val`: Calculates the sum of `is_active_with_txn_flag` for all customers in that country group. Since boolean `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in sums, this effectively counts the number of active customers with transactions.
    *   `denominator_val`: Similarly, sums `has_txn_flag` to count the total number of customers with transactions in that country group.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection to process each ticker individually.
2.  For each ticker, define a sub-collection `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. This sub-collection filters its `transactions_of` to include only those that:
    *   Have `transaction_type == ""sell""`.
    *   Occurred on or after one month ago from the current date (`date_time >= DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`).
3.  Filter out tickers that have no such sell transactions in the past month using `WHERE(HAS(sell_transactions_in_past_month) == 1)`.
4.  For the remaining tickers, calculate:
    *   `total_amount`: The sum of the `amount` from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`.
    *   `total_tax_comm`: The sum of (`tax` + `commission`) from `sell_transactions_in_past_month`. An inner `CALCULATE` is used to sum the combined `tax + commission` per transaction, adhering to PyDough syntax for expressions within aggregations.
5.  Calculate the `SPM` using the formula: `(total_amount - total_tax_comm) / total_amount * 100.0`.
    *   An `IFF` function is used to handle cases where `total_amount` might be zero, setting SPM to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
6.  The final result will include the `ticker_symbol` and the calculated `SPM`.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection and access their `historical_prices`.
2.  For each ticker's historical prices, extract the year and month from the `date` field. This is done in the first `CALCULATE` step.
3.  Partition these daily prices by year and month for each ticker using `PARTITION`. This groups all daily price records for a specific ticker within a specific month.
4.  Within each partition (i.e., for each ticker-month combination), calculate:
    *   The ticker symbol (from the parent `Tickers` collection).
    *   The year and month numbers.
    *   A formatted month string (YYYY-MM).
    *   The average closing price for that month (`AVG(Tickers.historical_prices.close)`).
    *   The highest price for that month (`MAX(Tickers.historical_prices.high)`).
    *   The lowest price for that month (`MIN(Tickers.historical_prices.low)`).
    This is done in the second `CALCULATE` step, resulting in a collection called `ticker_monthly_aggregates`. Each row represents a monthly summary for a specific ticker.
5.  On the `ticker_monthly_aggregates` collection, use another `CALCULATE` to determine the previous month's average closing price using the `PREV` window function.
    *   `PREV(out_avg_close, by=(out_year.ASC(), out_month.ASC()), per=""Tickers"", default=None)`: This looks up the `out_avg_close` from the previous record, ordered by year and month, specifically within the context of each ticker (`per=""Tickers""`). If no previous month exists (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), it defaults to `None`.
6.  Finally, use a third `CALCULATE` step to:
    *   Compute the MoMC: `(current_avg_close - prev_avg_close) / prev_avg_close`.
    *   Handle cases where the previous month's average close is `None` or zero to avoid division errors, setting MoMC to `None` in such cases.
    *   Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Customers.CALCULATE(...)`: This initiates an operation on the `Customers` collection.

    *   `num_join_month_txns=COUNT(...)`: This calculates the number of transactions for each customer that occurred in the same month and year as their `join_date`.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer.
        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions where the month of `date_time` matches the month of `join_date`, AND the year of `date_time` matches the year of `join_date` are considered.

**Explanation:**

1.  `dated_transactions`: This variable stores transactions filtered to be within the date range of January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` function ensures that the time component of `date_time` is ignored, making the date comparison accurate for inclusivity.
2.  `type_summary`:
    *   We partition `dated_transactions` by `transaction_type`. This groups all transactions of the same type together.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
        *   `num_distinct_customers`: The count of unique `customer_id`s who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)` achieves this.
        *   `avg_shares`: The average number of `shares` for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG(Transactions.shares)` calculates this.
3.  `result`: This variable takes `type_summary` and applies `TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`.

    *   We can use the `HAS()` function combined with a `WHERE` clause on the `historical_prices` sub-collection to check for the existence of such price records.
3.  For the filtered tickers, select their `_id` (which is the ticker's unique identifier) and present it as `ticker_id`.

This approach directly gives a distinct list of ticker IDs because we are iterating over the `Tickers` collection.

3.  `.CALCULATE(ticker_id=_id)`: For each ticker that passes the filter, this step selects its `_id` field (which is the unique identifier for a ticker) and renames it to `ticker_id` in the output.

**Explanation:**

1.  `transaction_details = Transactions.CALCULATE(c_state=customer.state, t_type=ticker.ticker_type)`:

2.  `transaction_details.PARTITION(name=""state_type_groups"", by=(c_state, t_type))`:
    *   We take the `transaction_details` (which now includes `c_state` and `t_type`).

        *   `<= 6` ensures we include today (0 days difference) up to 6 days ago, covering a 7-day period.
2.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: This line calculates the final result at the top `Broker` level.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter out customers who have no transactions using `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`. The `transactions_made` sub-collection links customers to their transactions.
3.  For each remaining customer, calculate the date of their first transaction. This can be found by taking the `MIN()` of the `date_time` from their `transactions_made`.
4.  Use the `DATEDIFF()` function to find the difference in ""days"" between the customer's `join_date` and the date of their first transaction.
5.  Select the customer's `_id` (renamed to `customer_id`) and the calculated time difference.

```python

**Explanation:**

1.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `status == ""successful""`: Ensures we only consider transactions that were completed successfully.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Filters for transactions within the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Further filters for transactions occurring in January (1), February (2), or March (3), which constitute the first quarter.
2.  `.CALCULATE(transaction_month_number = MONTH(date_time))`: After filtering, we create a new field `transaction_month_number` which stores the month of each transaction. The original `price` field from `Transactions` is implicitly available for later aggregation.
3.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_group"", by=(transaction_month_number))`: We then partition the filtered and augmented transactions into groups based on the `transaction_month_number`. Each group will contain all successful transactions for a specific month in Q1 2023.
4.  `.CALCULATE(month = transaction_month_number, average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price))`: For each partition (i.e., for each month):
    *   `month = transaction_month_number`: We select the month number for the output.
    *   `average_transaction_price = AVG(Transactions.price)`: We calculate the average of the `price` field for all transactions within that specific month's group. `Transactions.price` here refers to the `price` of the transactions belonging to the current partition.
5.  `result = monthly_average_transaction_prices`: The final result contains each month of Q1 2023 (as a number 1, 2, or 3) and the calculated average transaction price for successful transactions within that month.",31.949655771255493,"# Filter transactions for Q1 2023 that were successful

1.  Filter the `Cars` collection to include only those cars where the `vin_number` contains 'M5'. We'll use `LOWER()` and `LIKE` with '%' wildcards for a case-insensitive partial match as requested.
2.  Partition the filtered cars by their `make` and `model`. This will group cars of the same make and model together.
3.  For each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination from the filtered cars), calculate:
    *   The `make` of the car.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `cars_with_m5_vin = Cars.WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`:
    *   This line starts with the `Cars` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these cars.
    *   `LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%')` checks if the lowercase version of `vin_number` contains the substring 'm5'. The `%` are wildcards, meaning 'm5' can appear anywhere in the VIN. This ensures a case-insensitive partial match for 'M5' in the VIN.

2.  `sales_count_per_model_with_m5_vin = cars_with_m5_vin.PARTITION(...)`:
    *   This takes the `cars_with_m5_vin` (cars that matched the VIN criteria).
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""car_model_group"", by=(make, model))` groups these cars. Each group will consist of cars having the same `make` and `model`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(car_make=make, car_model=model, number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records))`:
    *   This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` for the current group.
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` for the current group.
    *   `number_of_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Counts the total number of `sale_records` associated with all cars belonging to the current `make` and `model` group. `Cars.sale_records` refers to the `sale_records` of the cars within the partition group.

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) < 30`: Ensures that the `sale_date` occurred within the last 30 days (i.e., the difference in days between the `sale_date` and `DATETIME('now')` is 0, 1, ..., up to 29). This covers today and the 29 preceding days.

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them to avoid conflicts in subsequent calculations.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_details_with_inventory_status`: We start by processing each record in the `Sales` collection. For every sale, we extract the `make` and `model` of the car involved (`car.make`, `car.model`), the `sale_price` of that transaction, and determine the car's `latest_inventory_status`.
    *   The `latest_inventory_status` is found by looking at the car's `inventory_snapshots`. We select the snapshot with the most recent `snapshot_date` using `TOP_K(1, by=snapshot_date.DESC())`. `SINGULAR()` is used to access the fields of this single snapshot.
    *   `IFF(HAS(car.inventory_snapshots) == 1, ..., True)` handles cases where a car might not have any inventory snapshots. If snapshots exist, we use the latest one; otherwise, we default the status to `True` (in inventory), ensuring these cars are filtered out later.
2.  `sold_cars_not_in_inventory`: We filter the results from the previous step, keeping only records where `latest_inventory_status` is `False`, meaning the car has been sold and is confirmed to be out of inventory based on its latest snapshot.
3.  `max_prices_by_make_model`: We then use `PARTITION` to group these filtered sales by `car_make_val` and `car_model_val`. Within each group (i.e., for each unique make and model combination), we `CALCULATE` the final output fields:
    *   `make`: The car's make.
    *   `model`: The car's model.
    *   `highest_sale_price`: The maximum `current_sale_price` found among all sales for that specific make and model combination that met the criteria.

This approach ensures that any month within the last six (excluding the current) that had at least one sale globally will be listed, and the PMSPS/PMSR for the specified salespersons in that month will be calculated (defaulting to 0 if no relevant sales).

Explanation:
- We start with the `Dealership` high-level collection because we want a single aggregated result.
- Inside `CALCULATE`, we define a new field `average_sale_price_q1_2023`.
- `AVG(Sales.WHERE(...).sale_price)` calculates the average sale price.
- `Sales.WHERE(...)` filters the sales:
    - `YEAR(sale_date) == 2023` ensures the sales are from the year 2023.
    - `ISIN(MONTH(sale_date), (1, 2, 3))` ensures the sales are from January, February, or March (the first quarter).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`**:
    *   We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection because each payment record is directly associated with a sale and has a payment date.
    *   For each payment, we access its corresponding sale information via `sale_record`.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment. This difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_difference`.

2.  **`AVG(...)`**:
    *   The `AVG()` function then calculates the average of all the `days_difference` values computed in the previous step across all payment records.

3.  **`ROUND(..., 2)`**:
    *   The `ROUND()` function takes the calculated average and rounds it to 2 decimal places, as requested.

4.  **`Dealership.CALCULATE(average_days_to_payment=...)`**:

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to:
1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for these sales.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of `cost` for the cars sold.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The PyDough code will first calculate the total revenue and total cost for sales in 2023. Then, it will use these values in a subsequent `CALCULATE` step to compute the GPM.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

).CALCULATE(
    # Calculate GPM using the provided formula: (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100

    gpm_for_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023) / total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 * 100
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across all relevant sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For these filtered sales, it accesses their `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale in 2023, it navigates to the related `car` (from the `Cars` collection) and accesses its `cost`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_for_2023 = ...)`: This second `CALCULATE` step takes the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023` computed in the first step.
5.  `gpm_for_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023) / total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 * 100`: This applies the GPM formula to calculate the gross profit margin for 2023 sales.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to find sales where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `car` associated with each sale.
    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

```python
# Filter sales to find those where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory

result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(
    make=car.make,
    model=car.model,
    sale_price=sale_price
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:
        *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.
        *   `model=car.model`: Retrieves the `model` of the car.
        *   `sale_price=sale_price`: Retrieves the `sale_price` from the sale record.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change.

1.  **Data Preparation (`payments_info`):**

    *   For each payment record, it extracts the `payment_year_val` (year) and `payment_month_val` (month) from the `payment_date` field using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions.

2.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_aggregated_payments`):**
    *   The `payments_info` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_payment_groups"", by=(payment_year_val, payment_month_val))`. This groups the payment records by unique year-month combinations.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each month), `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Output the `output_year` (which is `payment_year_val`) and `output_month` (which is `payment_month_val`).
        *   Calculate `total_monthly_amount` by summing `payment_amount` for all payments within that specific year-month group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.
    *   The results are then ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC())`. This sorting is crucial for the correct operation of the `PREV` function in the next step.

3.  **MoM Change Calculation (`result`):**
    *   This final `CALCULATE` step operates on the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection.
    *   It includes `output_year`, `output_month`, and `total_monthly_amount` from the previous step.
    *   It calculates `month_over_month_change` using the formula: `total_monthly_amount - PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))`.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))` fetches the `total_monthly_amount` from the immediately preceding month in the ordered dataset.
        *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV` will return `None` (or a similar null equivalent), resulting in `month_over_month_change` being `None` for that first month, which is appropriate as there's no prior month to compare against.

The query will return results for each month that has payment records. Months with absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection will not be listed in the output.

3.  For each salesperson, also calculate the total revenue from these recent sales by summing the `sale_price` of the filtered sales.
4.  Use `TOP_K` to select the top 5 salespersons based on the `num_recent_sales` in descending order.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each salesperson.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: We store the first and last names in new variables to be used later.
    *   `num_recent_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30))`: For each salesperson, we access their `sales_made` sub-collection. We then filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days from the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). `COUNT` then gives us the number of such sales.
    *   `total_recent_revenue=DEFAULT_TO(SUM(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 30).sale_price), 0.0)`: Similarly, we filter the `sales_made` for the last 30 days and then `SUM` their `sale_price` to get the total revenue. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a salesperson has no recent sales, their revenue is 0.
2.  `.TOP_K(5, by=num_recent_sales.DESC())`: This function takes the results from the previous `CALCULATE` step and selects the top 5 salespersons. The ranking is based on `num_recent_sales` in descending order (`DESC()`), so those with the most recent sales appear first.
3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step formats the output for the top 5 salespersons.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`: Retrieves the stored names.
    *   `sales_count=num_recent_sales`: Assigns the calculated number of recent sales to `sales_count`.
    *   `total_revenue_amount=total_recent_revenue`: Assigns the calculated total recent revenue to `total_revenue_amount`.",30.53442883491516,"top_salespersons_by_recent_sales = Salespersons.CALCULATE(

Explanation:

result = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car using `car.make` and `car.model`. These are stored as new temporary fields `car_mk` and `car_mdl` in the `sales_info` collection. The original `sale_price` from each sale is implicitly carried over.

2.  `model_summary = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_info` collection. The `by=(car_mk, car_mdl)` clause groups the sales records by unique combinations of car make and model.
    *   Within each group (partition), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `make = car_mk`: The make of the car for the current group.
        *   `model = car_mdl`: The model of the car for the current group.
        *   `total_number_of_sales = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records belonging to the current make/model group.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` of all sales records in the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that car model.

3.  `result = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` is applied to the `model_summary`. This sorts all car models by their `total_revenue` in descending order and selects the top 5, effectively giving us the 5 best-selling car models by revenue. The output includes the `make`, `model`, `total_number_of_sales`, and `total_revenue` for each of these top 5 models.",59.947993516922,"# Step 1: Create an intermediate collection from Sales, adding car make and model for partitioning.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, two new fields are derived for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: This extracts the `state` from the `customer` associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
        *   `q_start_date`: This determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the sale:
            *   Months 1, 2, 3 (Q1) map to ""2023-01-01"".
            *   Months 4, 5, 6 (Q2) map to ""2023-04-01"".
            *   Months 7, 8, 9 (Q3) map to ""2023-07-01"".
            *   Months 10, 11, 12 (Q4) map to ""2023-10-01"".
    *   The `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records is implicitly available for aggregation in the next step.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`result`):**
    *   The `sales_data_for_partition` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""quarterly_sales_groups"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   After partitioning, another `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_start_date = q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_sales = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific customer state and quarter. The `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records belonging to each partition group.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",53.3737518787384,"# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

6.  Finally, for each drug, calculate the average of all such `ddd_value_for_treatment` values using the `AVG()` aggregation function. This will be stored in `avg_ddd_val`.
7.  The query will return the `drug_name` and its corresponding `avg_ddd_val`.

1.  **Calculate Metrics per Doctor**: For each doctor, we first calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by accessing the `prescribed_treatments` sub-collection, then the `drug` associated with each treatment, and finally counting the distinct drug identifiers (`drug_id`). This result is stored in an intermediate collection `doctor_metrics`.

2.  **Partition Doctors by Specialty**: We then partition the `doctor_metrics` collection by the `speciality` field. This groups doctors based on their specialty. Each group (partition) is named `specialty_group`.

3.  **Rank Doctors within Each Specialty**: For each `specialty_group` (i.e., for each specialty), we access the `Doctors` records belonging to that group. For these doctors, we then:
    *   Select the required fields: `doc_id` and `speciality`.
    *   Use the previously calculated count of distinct drugs, renaming it to `number_of_distinct_drugs` for the final output.
    *   Calculate `SDRSDR` (Specialty Drug Rank) using the `RANKING` window function. The ranking is performed `by` the number of distinct drugs in descending order (so more drugs mean a better/lower rank number, e.g., rank 1) and `per=""specialty_group""` ensures the rank is calculated independently within each specialty.

This approach ensures that each doctor's rank is relative to other doctors within the same specialty.

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**: We first establish the relevant time window. This window starts 12 months prior to the beginning of the current month and ends just before the current month begins. We use `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` to get the first day of the current month and `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-12 months')` to get the first day of the month 12 months ago.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select `Treatments` that have a `start_dt` falling within this 12-month window.
3.  **Extract Year and Month**: For each filtered treatment, we extract the `YEAR` and `MONTH` from its `start_dt`. These will be used for grouping.
4.  **Partition Data**: We partition the treatments by the extracted `treatment_year_for_grouping` and `treatment_month_for_grouping`. This groups all treatments that occurred in the same month and year.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each month-year group, we count the number of unique patients who received a treatment (and thus a diagnosis, as treatments link patients to diagnoses). This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient_id)`.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each month-year group, we count the total number of treatments. This is calculated using `COUNT(Treatments)`.
6.  **Format and Order**: The results are ordered by year and month. We then format a `year_month_str` string (e.g., ""YYYY-MM"") for readability and select the final PMPD and PMTC values.

2.  **Filter for First Treatments**: Keep only those treatments that are identified as a patient's first treatment. Each record at this stage represents a patient becoming ""new"" to the system.
3.  **Determine Year of First Treatment**: For each of these first treatments, extract the year from its `start_dt`. This is the year the patient became a ""new patient"".
4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year. If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the data), `PREV` returns `None`, making the `npi` also `None`.",81.73630666732788,"# Step 1: Access treatments for each patient and rank them by start date

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc = Outcomes.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It filters for records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null, as per the requirement.
2.  `pir_calculation_steps = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts a calculation at the highest level of the database (`DermTreatment`) to compute global statistics.
    *   `avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` across all outcomes present in the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc` collection.
    *   `avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc.day100_pasi_score)`: Similarly, calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_d7d100pir = IFF(...))`: This subsequent `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step to apply the D7D100PIR formula.
    *   `IFF(avg_pasi_d7 == 0, None, ...)`: This conditional logic checks if `avg_pasi_d7` is zero. If it is, `None` is returned for the PIR to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, the formula `(avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0` is computed. The `100.0` ensures the result is a float and represents a percentage.
4.  `result = pir_calculation_steps.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR_percentage = calculated_d7d100pir)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the `calculated_d7d100pir` value and renames it to `D7D100PIR_percentage`, which is the requested output. The result will be a collection with a single row and a single column containing the overall D7D100PIR percentage.",58.49911117553711,"# Step 1: Filter outcomes to include only those with non-null PASI scores for both day 7 and day 100.

What is the PIC for female patients?PIC = private insured patient count,SELECT COUNT(patient_id) AS pic FROM patients WHERE gender = 'Female' AND ins_type = 'private';,DermTreatment,"To calculate the Private Insured Patient Count (PIC) for female patients, we need to:
1. Access the `Patients` collection.
2. Filter these patients to include only those whose `gender` is 'Female'.
3. Further filter these female patients to include only those whose `ins_type` indicates private insurance. We'll assume 'Private' is the value for private insurance.
4. Count the number of patients who meet both criteria.
5. Assign this count to a field named `PIC`.

Explanation:
- We start with the `DermTreatment` graph, which is the entry point to access all collections.
- We use the `CALCULATE` function to compute a new value.
- `PIC` is the name of the field we are creating.
- `COUNT(Patients.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private')))`:
    - `Patients` refers to the collection of all patients.
    - `.WHERE((gender == 'Female') & (ins_type == 'Private'))` filters the patients.
        - `gender == 'Female'` selects patients whose gender is 'Female'.
        - `ins_type == 'Private'` selects patients whose insurance type is 'Private'.
        - The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only patients who are female AND have private insurance are selected.
    - `COUNT(...)` then counts the number of patients that satisfy the combined conditions.
The final result will be a single record with one field, `PIC`, containing the count of female patients with private insurance.",8.394385576248169,"result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(

3.  From the filtered list of doctors, select their `loc_state`. This might result in a list with duplicate states if multiple doctors are from the same state.

It also requires the count of distinct patients for each of these insurance types.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:
1.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Treatments` collection.
    *   Filters treatments to include only those where the `end_dt` (end date) falls within the year 2022 using `YEAR(end_dt) == 2022`.
    *   It also ensures that these treatments have associated outcome records using `HAS(outcome_records) == 1`, as PASI scores are derived from outcomes.
    *   A new field, `p_ins_type`, is calculated, storing the `ins_type` (insurance type) of the patient associated with each treatment. This field will be used for grouping.

2.  **Group by Insurance Type and Calculate Metrics**:
    *   The filtered treatment data (`treatments_base_data`) is then partitioned by `p_ins_type` (patient's insurance type). Each partition (`insurance_partition`) represents a unique insurance type.
    *   Within each partition (i.e., for each insurance type), the following metrics are calculated:
        *   `insurance_type`: The insurance type itself (derived from the partition key `p_ins_type`).
        *   `average_pasi_score_at_day_100`: This is the average of `day100_pasi_score` from all `outcome_records` linked to the treatments within that specific insurance type group.
        *   `number_of_distinct_patients`: This counts the unique `patient_id`s associated with the treatments in that insurance type group, effectively giving the number of distinct patients.

3.  **Select Top 5 Insurance Types**:
    *   Finally, the `TOP_K` function is applied to the grouped results (`grouped_by_insurance`).
    *   It selects the top 5 insurance types.
    *   The sorting is done by `average_pasi_score_at_day_100` in ascending order (`ASC()`), so insurance types with the lowest average PASI scores appear first.

The final `result` will contain these top 5 insurance types along with their calculated average PASI score at day 100 and the count of distinct patients.

We need to return the diagnosis name, the count of distinct patients, and this maximum itch score.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  Start with the `Diagnoses` collection.
2.  Filter out diagnoses that do not have any associated outcome records or patients, as these would not be relevant for the ranking. We use `HAS(treatments_for.outcome_records) == 1` to ensure there's data for calculating the maximum score, and `HAS(treatments_for.patient) == 1` to ensure there are patients to count.
3.  For each remaining diagnosis, calculate:
    *   `diagnosis_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis (`diag_name`).
    *   `max_itch_score_val`: The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score. This is found by looking through all `treatments_for` the diagnosis, then their `outcome_records`, and taking the `MAX` of `day100_itch_vas`.
    *   `num_distinct_patients_val`: The number of unique patients associated with treatments for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT` on `treatments_for.patient.patient_id`.
4.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=expression)` to select the top 3 diagnoses. According to the ""single most straightforward interpretation"" rule, we'll use the primary criterion mentioned, which is the `max_itch_score_val`, in descending order. Null scores will be placed last.
5.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` to format the output, selecting `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` with the requested names.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date_calc = DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')`: This line defines a variable holding the start date for our analysis period. It calculates the date that was 6 months ago from the start of the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, 2024, `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` would be July 1st, 2024, and subtracting 6 months would result in January 1st, 2024.
2.  `prepared_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Treatments` collection. It selects treatments where the `start_dt` is within the last 6 calendar months (from `start_period_date_calc` up to the current time).
3.  `.CALCULATE(doc_specialty_calc = doctor.speciality)`: For these filtered treatments, it retrieves the `speciality` of the prescribing `doctor` and assigns it to a new calculated field `doc_specialty_calc`. This field will be used for grouping.
4.  `specialty_aggregated_data = prepared_treatments.PARTITION(...)`: This partitions the `prepared_treatments` data by `doc_specialty_calc`. This means all treatments prescribed by doctors of the same specialty are grouped together.
5.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: Within each specialty group (partition), this calculates:
    *   `specialty_output = doc_specialty_calc`: The name of the specialty.
    *   `num_treatments_calc = COUNT(Treatments)`: The total number of treatments associated with this specialty within the filtered period.
    *   `total_drug_amount_calc = SUM(Treatments.tot_drug_amt)`: The sum of `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with this specialty in the filtered period.
6.  `top_3_specialties_intermediate = specialty_aggregated_data.TOP_K(3, by=total_drug_amount_calc.DESC())`: This takes the aggregated data for each specialty and selects the top 3 specialties based on `total_drug_amount_calc` in descending order.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
        *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` and rename it to `insurance_type` for clarity in the output.
        *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that specific insurance type group.

Explanation:
The PyDough code performs the following operations:
1.  `Drugs.WHERE(HAS(treatments_used_in)==1)`: Filters the `Drugs` collection to retain only those drugs that have at least one associated treatment. This ensures that subsequent calculations like `COUNT` and `AVG` are meaningful.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each of the filtered drugs, this step calculates three new fields:

    *   `num_treatments=COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with each drug.
    *   `average_drug_amount=AVG(treatments_used_in.tot_drug_amt)`: Calculates the average of the `tot_drug_amt` for all treatments associated with each drug.

2.  Filter the `Treatments` collection based on three conditions combined with an AND (`&`) operator:
    *   **Diagnosis Condition**: The `diag_name` of the associated `diagnosis` must contain 'psoriasis'. This is achieved by converting the `diag_name` to lowercase using `LOWER()` and then using the `LIKE` operator with the pattern `'%psoriasis%'` for a case-insensitive wildcard match.
    *   **Drug Approval Condition**: The `drug` used in the treatment must be FDA-approved. This is checked by verifying that the `fda_appr_dt` field in the associated `drug` record exists (is not null) using `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`.
    *   **Treatment End Date Condition**: The `end_dt` of the treatment must be within the last 6 months from today. This means the `end_dt` must be greater than or equal to ""6 months ago"" and less than or equal to ""today"".
3.  Count the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions using the `COUNT()` aggregation function.
4.  The final result will be a single value representing this count, calculated on the `DermTreatment` graph.

# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months

This PyDough code snippet first defines the relevant time window. Then, it filters the `Treatments` collection. A treatment is included if:
1. Its linked diagnosis's name (`diagnosis.diag_name`), when converted to lowercase, matches the pattern `'%psoriasis%'` (meaning it contains ""psoriasis"").
2. Its linked drug (`drug`) has an FDA approval date (`fda_appr_dt` is not null).
3. Its end date (`end_dt`) falls between 6 months ago and today, inclusive.
Finally, it calculates the total number of treatments that meet all these conditions and assigns this count to `num_qualifying_treatments`.",24.286306381225582,"# Define the date boundaries for the last 6 months

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`**:
    *   Starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to include only those records where `is_placebo` is true.

2.  **First `.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `treatment_id_val = treatment_id`: Stores the `treatment_id` of the placebo treatment.
    *   `current_treatment_start_dt = start_dt`: Stores the `start_dt` (start date) of the placebo treatment. This is crucial for use in the sub-query for `concomitant_meds`.
    *   `treatment_end_dt_val = end_dt`: Stores the `end_dt` (end date) of the placebo treatment.
    *   `qualifying_concomitant_meds = concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`: This processes the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each placebo treatment.
        *   The `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications:
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", current_treatment_start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date. `current_treatment_start_dt` refers to the parent treatment's start date, and the second `start_dt` refers to the concomitant medication's start date.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", current_treatment_start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started no more than 14 days (2 weeks) after the treatment's start date.
        *   The nested `.CALCULATE(...)` then selects the required fields for these filtered concomitant medications:
            *   `con_med_start_dt = start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication.
            *   `con_med_end_dt = end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

3.  **`.WHERE(HAS(qualifying_concomitant_meds) == 1)`**:
    *   After calculating `qualifying_concomitant_meds` for each placebo treatment, this filters out any treatments that do not have at least one concomitant medication meeting the specified date criteria.

4.  **Second `.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output to include only the requested fields with clear names:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment_id_val`: The ID of the placebo treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_date = current_treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the placebo treatment.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, we need to calculate two values based on their `transactions_received`:
    *   `distinct_coupons_used_count`: The number of unique coupons used in transactions that were 'successful' and had a coupon associated. This is found by taking `transactions_received`, filtering them by `status == ""successful""` and where `coupon_id` is present, and then counting the number of distinct `coupon_id`s.
    *   `distinct_successful_transactions_count`: The total number of 'successful' transactions. This is found by taking `transactions_received`, filtering them by `status == ""successful""`, and then counting these transactions.
3.  Calculate CPUR using the formula: `CPUR = distinct_coupons_used_count / distinct_successful_transactions_count`.
4.  To handle cases where a merchant might have zero successful transactions (to prevent division by zero), we use the `IFF` function. If there are no successful transactions, CPUR will be 0.0.
5.  The final result will include the `merchant_name` and the calculated `CPUR`.

We will use two `CALCULATE` steps: the first to compute the counts, and the second to compute the CPUR and select the final fields.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating through each merchant.
    *   `merchant_name_val=name`: We select the merchant's name and store it temporarily.
    *   `distinct_coupons_used_count=NDISTINCT(...)`:
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE((status == ""successful"") & (HAS(coupon_id) == 1))`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were successful and where a coupon was used (i.e., `coupon_id` is present).
        *   `.coupon_id`: We then look at the `coupon_id` of these filtered transactions.
        *   `NDISTINCT(...)`: This counts the number of unique `coupon_id`s among these transactions.
    *   `distinct_successful_transactions_count=COUNT(...)`:
        *   `transactions_received.WHERE(status == ""successful"")`: This filters the merchant's received transactions to include only those that were successful.
        *   `COUNT(...)`: This counts the total number of such successful transactions.
2.  `merchant_transaction_stats.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` step uses the results from the first one.
    *   `merchant_name=merchant_name_val`: We rename `merchant_name_val` to `merchant_name` for the final output.
    *   `CPUR=IFF(...)`: This calculates the Coupon Usage Rate.
        *   `distinct_successful_transactions_count > 0`: This is the condition for the `IFF` function. It checks if there were any successful transactions.
        *   `distinct_coupons_used_count / distinct_successful_transactions_count`: If the condition is true (there were successful transactions), CPUR is calculated as the ratio of distinct coupons used to the count of distinct successful transactions.
        *   `0.0`: If the condition is false (no successful transactions), CPUR is set to 0.0 to avoid division by zero and provide a float output.

The results should be grouped by week.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **`Users.WHERE(ISIN(country, ('US', 'CA')))`**: Filters the `Users` collection to include only users whose `country` is either 'US' or 'CA'.
2.  **`.notifications`**: Accesses the `notifications` sub-collection for these filtered users.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each notification, it calculates two new fields:
    *   `notification_week_start = DATETIME(created_at, 'start of week')`: Truncates the `created_at` timestamp of the notification to the start of its week. This will be used for grouping.
    *   `is_weekend_notification = ISIN(DAYNAME(created_at), ('Saturday', 'Sunday'))`: Determines if the notification was created on a weekend (Saturday or Sunday). `DAYNAME(created_at)` extracts the name of the day, and `ISIN` checks if it's one of the specified weekend days. This results in a boolean value (True if weekend, False otherwise).
4.  **`.WHERE(...)`**: Filters these processed notifications to include only those from the last three weeks, excluding the current week. This is done by checking if `notification_week_start` is one of:
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-1 week')`: The start of last week.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-2 weeks')`: The start of the week before last.
    *   `DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-3 weeks')`: The start of the week three weeks ago.
5.  **`.PARTITION(name=""weekly_summary"", by=(notification_week_start))`**: Groups the filtered notifications by the `notification_week_start`. Each group will represent one of the three target weeks.
6.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: For each group (i.e., each week) created by the `PARTITION` clause:
    *   `week = notification_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for the output.
    *   `total_notifications = COUNT(Notifications)`: Counts all notifications within that specific week's group. `Notifications` here refers to the sub-collection of notifications belonging to the current partition.
    *   `weekend_notifications = SUM(Notifications.is_weekend_notification)`: Sums the `is_weekend_notification` boolean flag for all notifications in that week's group. Assuming boolean True is treated as 1 and False as 0 in `SUM` (as suggested by PyDough examples like `SUM(is_active)`), this effectively counts the weekend notifications.
7.  **`.ORDER_BY(week.DESC())`**: Orders the final results by the week's start date in descending order, so the most recent of the three weeks appears first.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and applying filters.
    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose category is 'retail'. `LOWER(category)` converts the merchant's category to lowercase, ensuring a case-insensitive match with ""retail"".
    *   **`(status == ""active"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition ensures that we only consider merchants who have issued at least one coupon. The `HAS(coupons)` function checks if the `coupons` sub-collection (which is a list of coupons associated with the merchant) is not empty.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select and compute the desired output fields:
    *   **`merchant_name=name`**: This selects the `name` of the merchant and renames it to `merchant_name` in the output.
    *   **`total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`**: This counts the number of coupons associated with each filtered merchant using the `COUNT(coupons)` aggregation function and names this field `total_coupons_issued`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Users.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start with the `Users` collection and use `CALCULATE` to derive new fields for each user.

    *   **`WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`**:
        *   `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"")`: This window function is applied to the user's balances.
            *   `by=updated_at.DESC()`: It ranks the balances based on the `updated_at` timestamp in descending order, so the most recent balance gets rank 1.
            *   `per=""Users""`: This ensures that the ranking is performed independently for each user's set of balances.
        *   `== 1`: We filter the balances to keep only the one that has rank 1 (i.e., the most recent one).
    *   **`.SINGULAR()`**: Since the `WHERE` clause (with `RANKING ... == 1`) is expected to return exactly one balance record for each user (their latest), `SINGULAR()` converts this single-item collection into a singular record context. This allows us to access its fields directly.
    *   **`.balance`**: From the singular latest balance record, we extract the actual `balance` value.

merchants_with_revenue = Merchants.CALCULATE(
    m_name=name,

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`merchants_with_revenue = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This part starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates three new fields:
        *   `m_name`: The merchant's `name`.
        *   `m_category`: The merchant's `category`.
        *   `m_revenue`: This is the sum of `amount` from the `transactions_received` by the merchant. These transactions are filtered based on two conditions:
            *   `status == 'completed'`: Ensures only successfully completed transactions are counted.
            *   `receiver_type == 1`: Filters for transactions where the receiver type is specifically '1', as per the requirement for merchants.

2.  **`mrr_results = merchants_with_revenue.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This part takes the intermediate result (`merchants_with_revenue`) which contains each merchant along with their calculated revenue.
    *   It then calculates the final output fields:
        *   `merchant_name`: The name of the merchant (from `m_name`).
        *   `category`: The category of the merchant (from `m_category`).
        *   `revenue_amount`: The total revenue calculated for the merchant (from `m_revenue`).
        *   `revenue_rank`: This is determined using the `RANKING()` window function.
            *   `by=m_revenue.DESC()`: Ranks the merchants based on their `m_revenue` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest revenue gets rank 1.
            *   `allow_ties=True`: If multiple merchants have the same revenue, they will receive the same rank.

The final `mrr_results` variable will contain a list of merchants, each with their name, category, total revenue amount, and their corresponding revenue rank.",42.47313618659973,"# Step 1: Calculate total revenue for each merchant from their successfully received transactions.

What is the PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) for wallet transactions in the last 2 months excluding the current month?PMDAU (Per Month Daily Active Users) = distinct sender with  sender_type = 0.

PMDAU is interpreted as the average number of daily active users over a month.
An active user on a given day is defined as a distinct `sender_id` with `sender_type = 0` who made a transaction on that day.

The calculation covers the last two full months, excluding the current month. For example, if the current month is July, the query will calculate PMDAU for May and June.

The process involves these main steps:
1.  **Define Date Range**: Establish the period of interest, which starts from the first day of the month two months prior to the current month and ends just before the start of the current month.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this defined date range and have a `sender_type` of 0.
3.  **Prepare Data for Daily Aggregation**: For each filtered transaction, extract or calculate:
    *   `calc_year_month`: The start of the month in which the transaction occurred (e.g., '2023-05-01' for any transaction in May 2023). This is used for the final monthly grouping.
    *   `calc_day_date`: The start of the day on which the transaction occurred (e.g., '2023-05-15 00:00:00' for a transaction on May 15th, 2023). This is used for grouping by day.
    *   `calc_sender_id`: The `sender_id` from the transaction.
4.  **Calculate Daily Active Users (DAU)**:
    *   Group the prepared transaction data by `calc_year_month` and `calc_day_date`.
    *   For each unique day (each group), count the number of distinct `calc_sender_id` values. This count represents the DAU for that specific day. The resulting collection, `daily_active_user_counts`, will contain records each representing a day, its month, and its DAU.
5.  **Calculate Per Month Daily Active Users (PMDAU)**:
    *   Group the `daily_active_user_counts` (from step 4) by `grouped_year_month` (which is the `calc_year_month` carried forward).
    *   For each month, calculate the average of all `daily_dau` values associated with that month. This average is the PMDAU for that month.
6.  **Format Final Output**: Present the results with columns for the month (`month`) and the calculated PMDAU (`pmdau`), ordered chronologically by month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable holds sessions that fall within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_duration_seconds` (the duration of that single session in seconds) and keeps `session_user_id` (the `user_id` associated with the session).
2.  `user_total_session_durations`: This takes `sessions_with_duration` and groups them by `session_user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each unique user), it calculates:
    *   `user_id_output`: This is the `user_id` for the group.
    *   `total_duration_output`: This is the sum of `calculated_duration_seconds` for all sessions belonging to that user within the filtered range. The `UserSessions.calculated_duration_seconds` refers to the `calculated_duration_seconds` field of the records within each partition group, which originated from the `UserSessions` collection.

5.  **Return the Count**: The final result will be a single value representing the total count, aliased as TUC.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the start of the time window: exactly one month ago from the current moment.
one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')

# Filter UserSessions to include only those started in the past month (inclusive of 1 month ago).
sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)

# Calculate the total count of these sessions and name it TUC.
# The result is presented as a single value from the Ewallet context.
result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(
    TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_ts = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a contextless expression. It calculates the timestamp corresponding to exactly one month before the current moment (`'now'`). This timestamp will serve as the lower bound for our time window.
2.  `sessions_in_past_month = UserSessions.WHERE(session_start_ts >= one_month_ago_ts)`: This line accesses the `UserSessions` collection and filters its records. The `WHERE` clause keeps only those sessions where the `session_start_ts` (session start timestamp) is greater than or equal to `one_month_ago_ts`. This effectively selects all sessions that occurred from one month ago up to the present.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(TUC=COUNT(sessions_in_past_month))`: This line calculates the final result.
    *   It operates on the `Ewallet` (the high-level graph) context to produce a single aggregated value.
    *   `COUNT(sessions_in_past_month)` counts the number of records in the `sessions_in_past_month` collection (which are the sessions that met our time window criteria).
    *   This count is then assigned to a new field named `TUC`, as requested by the problem definition.
    *   The variable `result` will hold this final calculation.",21.85476136207581,"# Define the start of the time window: exactly one month ago from the current moment.

What was the STR for wallet transactions in the previous month?STR (success transaction rate) = number of successful transactions / total number of transactions,"SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*)) AS STR FROM wallet_transactions_daily WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', created_at) = strftime('%Y-%m', 'now', 'start of month', '-1 month');",Ewallet,"To calculate the Success Transaction Rate (STR) for wallet transactions in the previous month, we need to perform the following steps:

1.  **Determine the ""previous month""**: We'll use the `DATETIME` function to get the current date, then find the start of the current month, and subtract one month to get the start of the previous month. From this, we extract the year and month.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll filter all transactions that occurred within the determined previous month.
    *   **Assumption for ""wallet transactions""**: The query assumes that all transactions in the `Transactions` collection are considered ""wallet transactions"". If ""wallet transactions"" refer to a specific `transaction_type` (e.g., `transaction_type == 'WALLET'`), this condition would need to be added to the transaction filters.
3.  **Count Successful Transactions**: We'll count the transactions from the previous month that were successful.
    *   **Assumption for ""successful transaction""**: A transaction is considered successful if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`.
4.  **Count Total Transactions**: We'll count all transactions from the previous month.
5.  **Calculate STR**: STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions) * 100.0`. We'll also handle the case where the total number of transactions is zero to prevent division by zero, returning 0.0 in such cases.

The PyDough code will use a series of chained `CALCULATE` operations starting from the `Ewallet` collection to compute intermediate values (like the target year and month) and then use them to calculate the final STR.

**Explanation of the code:**

1.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)` block determines the target year (`_prev_month_target_year`) and month (`_prev_month_target_month`) corresponding to the ""previous month"" relative to the current date.
2.  The second `.CALCULATE(...)` block uses these date parameters to:
    *   Count `_num_successful_transactions_prev_month`: It filters the `Transactions` collection for records where the `created_at` date falls within the target previous month and the `status` is ""completed"".
    *   Count `_num_total_transactions_prev_month`: It filters the `Transactions` collection for all records where the `created_at` date falls within the target previous month.
3.  The third and final `.CALCULATE(...)` block computes the `previous_month_str`. It uses the `IFF` function to check if `_num_total_transactions_prev_month` is greater than zero.
    *   If true, it calculates STR as `(_num_successful_transactions_prev_month * 100.0) / _num_total_transactions_prev_month` (as a percentage).
    *   If false (i.e., no transactions in the previous month), it returns `0.0`.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by processing the `Merchants` collection.
    *   `m_id=mid, m_name=name`: We select the merchant's ID (`mid`) and `name`, renaming them to avoid conflicts and for clarity.
    *   `merchant_create_year=YEAR(created_at), merchant_create_month=MONTH(created_at)`: We extract the year and month of the merchant's creation date.
2.  The result of the first `CALCULATE` is then piped into a second `CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `m_id=m_id, m_name=m_name`: We carry forward the merchant's ID and name.
    *   `num_coupons_in_creation_month=COUNT(...)`: This is the core logic.
        *   `coupons.WHERE(...)`: We access the `coupons` sub-collection for the current merchant and filter them.
        *   `(YEAR(created_at) == merchant_create_year) & (MONTH(created_at) == merchant_create_month)`: This condition ensures that we only consider coupons whose creation year and month match the `merchant_create_year` and `merchant_create_month` (calculated in the previous step for the current merchant).
        *   `COUNT(...)`: We count how many coupons satisfy this condition for the current merchant.
3.  `merchant_coupon_info.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:
    *   This takes the collection of merchants (each now having the `num_coupons_in_creation_month` attribute) and selects the top 1 merchant.
    *   `by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC()`: The ranking is based on `num_coupons_in_creation_month` in descending order, so the merchant with the highest count comes first.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.WHERE(...)`: We start by filtering the `Users` collection.
    *   `LOWER(country) == 'us'`: This condition filters users whose country is 'US', ignoring case (e.g., 'us', 'US', 'Us' will all match).
    *   `HAS(notifications.WHERE((notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread'))) == 1`: This condition ensures that the user has at least one notification that meets the specified criteria:
        *   `notifications.WHERE(...)`: We look into the `notifications` sub-collection for each user.
        *   `(notification_type == 'promotional') & (status == 'unread')`: This filters the notifications to include only those that are 'promotional' and 'unread'.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This checks if there is at least one such notification for the user.
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only users from the US *and* having relevant notifications are selected.
2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: For the users who passed the filter, we calculate the desired output fields.
    *   `username=username`: This selects the `username` of the user.

"How many distinct active users sent money per month in 2023? Return the number of active users per month (as a date), starting from the earliest date. Do not include merchants in the query.

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_date` in ascending order, presenting the data from the earliest month in 2023 onwards.

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection who meet the specified criteria:
    *   Their `status` must be ""active"".
    *   Their `category` must contain the substring 'retail'. We'll use the `CONTAINS` function for this.
    *   They must have at least one balance record. We use `HAS(balances) == 1` to ensure this, which is important before attempting to find the ""latest"" balance.

2.  **Identify Latest Balance for Each Filtered Merchant**: For each merchant identified in step 1, we need to find their most recent balance.
    *   We access their `balances` sub-collection (which refers to `MerchantBalances` records).
    *   We use the `RANKING` window function, ordering the balances by `updated_at` in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` clause ensures that this ranking is done independently for each merchant from our filtered set.
    *   We then filter these ranked balances to keep only those with `RANKING(...) == 1`, effectively selecting the latest balance record for each qualifying merchant.

3.  **Calculate Median Balance**: Once we have the collection of latest balance records (one per relevant merchant), we extract the `balance` amount from each of these records.
    *   We then use the `MEDIAN` aggregation function to compute the median of these balance amounts.
    *   The final result will be a single value representing the median merchant wallet balance, calculated at the `Ewallet` (graph) level.

The term ""today's"" in the request is interpreted as the ""current"" or ""most recent"" balance, rather than balances specifically updated on the calendar day of today. This is a common interpretation for ""wallet balance"" and is more robust, as merchants may not have balance updates every day.

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To find the average user session duration in seconds, split by device_type, we can follow these steps:

1.  Access the `UserSessions` collection, which contains information about user sessions, including `session_start_ts`, `session_end_ts`, and `device_type`.
2.  Partition the `UserSessions` data by `device_type`. This will group all sessions that occurred on the same type of device.
3.  For each `device_type` group:
    a.  Calculate the duration of each individual session in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function: `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. This expression will be evaluated for each session within the current `device_type` group.
    b.  Compute the average of these calculated session durations using the `AVG` aggregation function.
4.  The final result will include the `device_type` and the corresponding `avg_session_duration_in_seconds`.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
average_duration_by_device_type = UserSessions.PARTITION(
    name=""device_group"", by=(device_type)
).CALCULATE(
    device_type = device_type,
    avg_session_duration_in_seconds = AVG(
        DATEDIFF(""seconds"", UserSessions.session_start_ts, UserSessions.session_end_ts)
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `UserSessions.PARTITION(name=""device_group"", by=(device_type))`: This part of the query takes the `UserSessions` collection and groups its records based on the unique values of the `device_type` field. Each group is conceptually named `device_group`.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is then applied to each `device_group`.
    *   `device_type = device_type`: This selects the `device_type` for the current group, which is the key by which the partition was made.
    *   `avg_session_duration_in_seconds = AVG(DATEDIFF(""seconds"", UserSessions.session_start_ts, UserSessions.session_end_ts))`:
        *   `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", UserSessions.session_start_ts, UserSessions.session_end_ts)`: For each user session record (`UserSessions`) within the current `device_type` group, this expression calculates the difference between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts` in seconds, effectively giving the duration of that specific session.
        *   `AVG(...)`: The `AVG` function then takes all these individual session durations (calculated for sessions within the current `device_type` group) and computes their average. This results in the average session duration for that specific `device_type`.",48.60748767852783,"average_duration_by_device_type = UserSessions.PARTITION(

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection and filter for those who have at least one coupon using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
2.  For each of these merchants, we need to find their registration date (`created_at`) and identify their earliest coupon. The earliest coupon can be found by taking their `coupons` sub-collection, ordering it by `start_date` in ascending order, and selecting the top one using `TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`. We then use `.SINGULAR()` to treat this single coupon record as directly accessible. This information is captured in a `CALCULATE` step.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, we extract the `cid` (coupon ID) and `start_date` from the earliest coupon record obtained in the previous step.
4.  We then filter these merchants using a `WHERE` clause. The condition is that the earliest coupon's `start_date` must be within one year of the merchant's `created_at` (registration date). This is checked by ensuring that the difference in days, calculated by `DATEDIFF(""days"", merchant_registration_date, earliest_coupon_start_date)`, is between 0 and 365, inclusive. This means the coupon started on or after the registration date, but no later than one year after.
5.  Finally, we use another `CALCULATE` to select and rename the required fields: merchant ID (`mid`), registration date (`created_at`), the earliest coupon's ID (`cid`), and the earliest coupon's start date (`start_date`).
