1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate two aggregate values:
    *   The total number of transactions they've made (`num_total_transactions`).
    *   The number of successful transactions they've made (`num_successful_transactions`). We'll assume a transaction is successful if its `status` is ""Completed"".
3.  Filter these customers to include only those where `num_total_transactions` is 5 or more.
4.  For the filtered customers, calculate their `success_rate` as `(num_successful_transactions * 100.0) / num_total_transactions`. We use `IFF` to handle potential division by zero, although the filter `num_total_transactions >= 5` already ensures the divisor is positive. Multiplying by `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and uses floating-point arithmetic.
5.  Select the customer's name and their calculated `success_rate`.
6.  Order the final result by `success_rate` in ascending order (lowest to highest).

```python
# Step 1: Calculate total and successful transaction counts for each customer
customer_transaction_counts = Customers.CALCULATE(
    cust_name=name,
    total_trans_count=COUNT(transactions_made),
    successful_trans_count=COUNT(transactions_made.WHERE(status == ""Completed""))

1.  Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols.
2.  Filter the `Customers` collection based on two conditions:
    *   The customer's `email` must end with "".com"".
    *   The customer must have at least one transaction (`transactions_made`) where the `ticker.symbol` is one of the FAANG symbols.
3.  Count the number of customers who satisfy both conditions.

We will use a contextless expression to define the FAANG symbols for clarity. Then, we will filter the `Customers` collection using `WHERE` with combined conditions. The `ENDSWITH` function will check the email, and `HAS` combined with `ISIN` will check for FAANG stock transactions. Finally, `Broker.CALCULATE` with `COUNT` will give the total number of such distinct customers.

```python
# Define the list of FAANG ticker symbols
faang_symbols_list = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")

# Filter customers who have a "".com"" email and have traded FAANG stocks

**Explanation:**

1.  `faang_symbols_list = (""AMZN"", ""AAPL"", ""GOOGL"", ""META"", ""NFLX"")`: This line defines a contextless expression, a tuple named `faang_symbols_list`, containing the ticker symbols for FAANG companies.
2.  `customers_with_faang_trades = Customers.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by accessing the `Customers` collection and applies a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
    *   `ENDSWITH(email, "".com"")`: This condition checks if the `email` field of a customer ends with "".com"".
    *   `HAS(transactions_made.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols_list))) == 1`: This condition checks if a customer has at least one transaction related to FAANG stocks.
        *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for each customer.
        *   `.WHERE(ISIN(ticker.symbol, faang_symbols_list))`: Filters these transactions to include only those where the `ticker.symbol` (accessed through the `ticker` relationship from `Transactions` to `Tickers`) is present in the `faang_symbols_list`.
        *   `HAS(...) == 1`: Returns true if the filtered list of transactions is not empty (i.e., the customer has made at least one FAANG stock transaction).
    *   The `&` operator combines these two conditions, so only customers satisfying both are included.
3.  `result = Broker.CALCULATE(num_faang_buyers_with_com_email = COUNT(customers_with_faang_trades))`: This line calculates the final result.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`filtered_customers = Customers.WHERE((join_date >= ""2023-01-01"") & (status == ""Active""))`**:
    *   We start with the `Customers` collection.
    *   The `WHERE` clause filters these customers based on two conditions combined with an AND (`&`):

        *   `status == ""Active""`: Selects customers whose status is 'Active'.
    *   The result `filtered_customers` is a collection of customers who meet both criteria (i.e., they are TAC as per the definition).

2.  **`tac_by_country = filtered_customers.PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country)).CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   We take the `filtered_customers` collection.
    *   `PARTITION(name=""country_group"", by=(country))`: This groups the filtered customers by their `country`. Each group (partition) will contain active customers from a specific country who joined on or after the specified date.
    *   `.CALCULATE(country=country, tac_count=COUNT(Customers))`: For each country group created by the partition:
        *   `country=country`: Selects the `country` field (which is the partition key).
        *   `tac_count=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers within that specific country group. Since these customers have already been filtered, this gives the Total Active Customers (TAC) for that country.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_boundaries`: We first establish the time frame. `current_week_start_date` marks the beginning of the current week. `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` marks the beginning of the week that started 8 weeks before the current week (e.g., if current week is W, this is start of W-8).
2.  `processed_transactions`:
    *   We start with `Broker.Transactions`.
    *   `WHERE(ticker.ticker_type == 'STOCK')`: Filters transactions to include only those where the associated ticker is of type 'STOCK'. You may need to adjust 'STOCK' if the actual `ticker_type` value for stocks is different.
    *   `CALCULATE(...)`:
        *   `transaction_week_start = DATETIME(date_time, 'start of week')`: For each transaction, this calculates the date of the Monday (or configured start of week) of the week it occurred in.
        *   `is_weekend_transaction = ISIN(DAYNAME(date_time), (""Saturday"", ""Sunday""))`: This creates a boolean field that is `True` if the transaction date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, and `False` otherwise.
3.  `transactions_in_period`: This filters `processed_transactions` to include only those whose `transaction_week_start` is on or after `eight_weeks_ago_start_date` and before `current_week_start_date`. This effectively selects transactions from the 8 full weeks preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_stock_summary`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""weekly_group"", by=(transaction_week_start))`: Groups the `transactions_in_period` by the `transaction_week_start`. Each group represents one week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each weekly group:
        *   `week_start_display = transaction_week_start`: Selects the week's start date for display.
        *   `total_stock_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: Counts the total number of transactions within that specific weekly group.
        *   `weekend_stock_transactions = SUM(Transactions.is_weekend_transaction)`: Sums the `is_weekend_transaction` boolean values. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0 in a sum, this counts transactions that occurred on a weekend.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(week_start_display.ASC())`: Sorts the final results chronologically by the week start date.
5.  `result = weekly_stock_summary`: Assigns the final computed table to `result`.

    These are calculated using the `DATETIME` function with `'start of week'` and date arithmetic.

2.  **Filter Transactions**: We access the `Transactions` collection.
    *   We filter these transactions to include only those where the `customer.country` is ""USA"".
    *   We further filter these transactions to ensure their `date_time` falls within our defined ""last week"" range: `date_time >= start_of_last_week_val` and `date_time < start_of_this_week_val`.

3.  **Aggregate Results**:
    *   `num_transactions`: We count the number of transactions that meet the above criteria using the `COUNT()` function.

4.  **Return Values**: The final result will contain `num_transactions` and `total_transaction_amount`.

This entire operation is performed starting from the `Broker` high-level collection, where we first calculate the date boundaries and then use them in a subsequent `CALCULATE` to get the desired aggregates.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Broker.CALCULATE(...)`: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection to define global values.
    *   `start_of_this_week_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the current week. This will serve as the exclusive upper bound for ""last week's"" transactions.
    *   `start_of_last_week_val = DATETIME('now', 'start of week', '-7 days')`: Calculates the timestamp for the beginning of the week immediately preceding the current week. This is the inclusive lower bound.

2.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: The second `CALCULATE` uses the date boundaries defined in the first one.
    *   `num_transactions = COUNT(...)`: This counts the transactions that satisfy the specified conditions.
        *   `Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We filter the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(Transactions.customer.country == ""USA"")`: Ensures the transaction was made by a customer whose country is ""USA"". We access the customer's country via the `customer` relationship on the `Transactions` collection.
        *   `(Transactions.date_time >= start_of_last_week_val) & (Transactions.date_time < start_of_this_week_val)`: Filters transactions to include only those that occurred on or after the start of last week and before the start of the current week.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(...)`: This sums the `amount` of the transactions that meet the same criteria.
        *   The `WHERE` clause is identical to the one used for `COUNT`, ensuring we are summing amounts for the same set of transactions.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  For each customer, calculate:
    *   Their name (`name`).
    *   The total number of transactions they've made (`COUNT(transactions_made)`).
    *   The sum of the amounts of all their transactions (`SUM(transactions_made.amount)`).
3.  Then, using these calculated values, rank each customer based on their total transaction amount in descending order. The customer with the highest total transaction amount will receive rank 1. This is achieved using the `RANKING` window function.
4.  Finally, select the customer's name, their calculated number of transactions, total transaction amount, and their rank (CR).

This requires two `CALCULATE` steps because a field defined in a `CALCULATE` clause (like `total_transaction_amount`) can only be referenced by subsequent operations like `RANKING` after that `CALCULATE` step is complete.

```python
# Step 1: Calculate initial aggregations for each customer: name, number of transactions, and total transaction amount.
customer_aggregates = Customers.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `customer_aggregates = Customers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Customers` collection.
    *   `c_name=name`: Selects the customer's name and assigns it to `c_name`.
    *   `num_trans=COUNT(transactions_made)`: Counts the number of transactions for each customer from their `transactions_made` sub-collection and assigns it to `num_trans`.
    *   `total_trans_amount_val=SUM(transactions_made.amount)`: Calculates the sum of the `amount` for all transactions in the `transactions_made` sub-collection for each customer and assigns it to `total_trans_amount_val`.

2.  `result = customer_aggregates.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the intermediate results from `customer_aggregates`.
    *   `customer_name=c_name`: Selects the customer's name.
    *   `number_of_transactions=num_trans`: Selects the calculated number of transactions.
    *   `total_transaction_amount=total_trans_amount_val`: Selects the calculated total transaction amount.
    *   `CR=RANKING(by=total_trans_amount_val.DESC())`: Calculates the rank for each customer.
        *   `RANKING(...)`: This is a window function that assigns a rank.
        *   `by=total_trans_amount_val.DESC()`: The ranking is based on the `total_trans_amount_val` field in descending order, so the customer with the highest total transaction amount gets rank 1. Since no `per` argument is specified, the ranking is global across all customers.

1.  Start with the `Transactions` collection.
2.  For each transaction, extract the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction date/time (`date_time`), and the transaction type (`transaction_type`). We use `CALCULATE` for this.
3.  Filter these transactions to include only those that:
    *   Are of type ""BUY"".
    *   Occurred within the last 10 days. We use `DATEDIFF(""days"", transaction_dt, DATETIME('now')) <= 9`. This condition covers a 10-day window including the current day (e.g., if today is Day 10, this includes Day 1 through Day 10).
4.  Group the filtered transactions by the ticker symbol using `PARTITION`. The partition key will be the `ticker_s` (ticker symbol) calculated earlier.
5.  For each group (i.e., for each ticker symbol), calculate the number of buy transactions using `COUNT(Transactions)`. The output fields will be `ticker_symbol` and `num_buy_transactions`.
6.  Finally, use `TOP_K(2, by=num_buy_transactions.DESC())` to select the 2 ticker symbols with the highest number of buy transactions in descending order of count.

2.  **Filter Customers**: We select customers whose `join_date` falls within this defined 6-month window.
3.  **Extract Signup Month and Year**: For these filtered customers, we extract the year and month of their `join_date`.
4.  **Group by Signup Month/Year**: We partition the customers based on their signup year and month.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMCS**: For each signup month-year group, we count the number of customers.
    *   **PMAT**: For each signup month-year group, we calculate the average `amount` from all transactions made by the customers in that group. If a group has no transactions, PMAT will default to 0.0.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_month_start_boundary` and `six_months_ago_start_boundary` define the date range for customer signups. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month')` gets the first day of the current month. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-6 months')` gets the first day of the month that was six months ago.
2.  `Customers.WHERE(...)` filters the `Customers` collection to include only those whose `join_date` is within the last six full months (e.g., if today is July 15th, this includes customers who joined from January 1st up to, but not including, July 1st).
3.  `.CALCULATE(signup_year_val=YEAR(join_date), signup_month_val=MONTH(join_date))` extracts the year and month from the `join_date` for these customers.
4.  `.PARTITION(name=""monthly_signup_cohorts"", by=(signup_year_val, signup_month_val))` groups these customers by the year and month they signed up.
5.  The final `.CALCULATE(...)` computes the requested metrics for each group:
    *   `signup_month_year=JOIN_STRINGS(""-"", signup_year_val, LPAD(signup_month_val, 2, ""0""))`: Formats the signup year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string. `LPAD` ensures the month is two digits (e.g., ""01"" for January).
    *   `pmcs=COUNT(Customers)`: Counts the number of customers in each `monthly_signup_cohorts` group, giving the Per Month Customer Signups.
    *   `pmat=DEFAULT_TO(AVG(Customers.transactions_made.amount), 0.0)`: Calculates the average transaction `amount` for all transactions made by customers in each group. `Customers.transactions_made` accesses the related transactions. `DEFAULT_TO(..., 0.0)` ensures that if a group of customers has no transactions, PMAT will be 0.0 instead of null.

2.  From these filtered records, we use `CALCULATE` to extract:
    *   The `ticker_type` from the related `ticker` record (aliased as `tick_type`).
    *   The `close` price (aliased as `price_close`).
    This results in an intermediate collection named `daily_prices_filtered`.
3.  We then `PARTITION` the `daily_prices_filtered` collection by `tick_type`. This groups all the daily price records from the last 7 days by their respective ticker types.
4.  Finally, for each `tick_type` group (partition), we use `CALCULATE` to:

1.  Filter the `Customers` collection to include only those who joined in the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered customers, we will create two boolean flags:
    *   `active_with_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer's status is ""active"" AND they have made at least one transaction (`HAS(transactions_made) == 1`). Otherwise, it's `False`.
    *   `has_tx_bool`: This flag will be `True` if a customer has made at least one transaction. Otherwise, it's `False`.
3.  We then partition these customers by their `country`.
4.  For each country group, we calculate:
    *   `num_active_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `active_with_tx_bool` flag. This counts customers who are active and have transactions. This forms the numerator of the AR formula.
    *   `num_total_customers_with_transactions`: The sum of the `has_tx_bool` flag. This counts all customers who have transactions. This forms the denominator of the AR formula.
    (We assume `SUM` treats `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, consistent with PyDough examples like `SUM(cust_info.is_active)`).
5.  Finally, we calculate the Activity Ratio (AR) using the provided formula: `(Number of Active Customers with Transactions / Total Number of Customers with Transactions) * 100`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `num_total_customers_with_transactions` is zero (i.e., no customers in that country who joined in 2022 had any transactions), setting AR to `0.0` to avoid division by zero.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Broker.CALCULATE(...)`**: We start at the top-level `Broker` collection because we want a single aggregated result (the count of customers).
2.  **`num_customers=COUNT(...)`**: We are calculating a new field called `num_customers`. The value of this field will be the count of customers who meet the specified criteria.
3.  **`Customers.WHERE(...)`**: We access the `Customers` collection and apply a filter using the `WHERE` clause.
4.  **`STARTSWITH(LOWER(name), 'j')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` starts with 'j'.
5.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(name), 'ez')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `name` ends with 'ez'.
6.  **`(... | ...)`**: The `|` (OR) operator combines the two name conditions, so a customer matches if their name starts with 'j' OR ends with 'ez'.
7.  **`ENDSWITH(LOWER(state), 'a')`**: This checks if the lowercase version of the customer's `state` ends with 'a'.
8.  **`(... & ...)`**: The `&` (AND) operator combines the name condition (already an OR) with the state condition. A customer must satisfy both the name criteria AND the state criteria to be included in the count.
9.  **`LOWER(...)`**: The `LOWER` function is used on both `name` and `state` fields to ensure the comparisons are case-insensitive as requested.",11.524117946624756,"filtered_customers_count = Broker.CALCULATE(

1.  Define the start of the ""past month"" period using `DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`.
2.  Filter the `Transactions` collection to include only ""sell"" transactions that occurred on or after this date.
3.  For these filtered transactions, calculate necessary fields: the ticker symbol (`ticker.symbol`), the transaction amount (`amount`), and the combined costs (`tax + commission`).
4.  Partition these processed transactions by the ticker symbol.
5.  For each ticker symbol group (partition):
    *   Calculate `total_amount_from_sells` by summing the `transaction_amount` for all transactions in that group.
    *   Calculate `total_transaction_costs` by summing the `transaction_costs` for all transactions in that group.
6.  Finally, calculate the SPM using the formula: `(total_amount_from_sells - total_transaction_costs) / total_amount_from_sells * 100.0`.
    *   We use `IFF` to handle cases where `total_amount_from_sells` is zero to prevent division by zero, returning `0.0` for SPM in such instances.

**Explanation:**

1.  `one_month_ago_date = DATETIME('now', '-1 month')`: This line defines a variable holding the date and time exactly one month prior to the current moment. This will be used to filter transactions.
2.  `relevant_transactions_data = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: We start by querying the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((transaction_type == ""sell"") & (date_time >= one_month_ago_date))`: This filters the transactions to include only those that are of `transaction_type` ""sell"" AND occurred on or after `one_month_ago_date`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each filtered transaction, we calculate:
        *   `ticker_symbol_val = ticker.symbol`: Extracts the stock symbol associated with the transaction.
        *   `current_transaction_amount = amount`: Takes the transaction amount.
        *   `current_transaction_costs = tax + commission`: Calculates the sum of tax and commission for the transaction.
3.  `spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker = relevant_transactions_data.PARTITION(...)`: This step groups the `relevant_transactions_data` by `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `name=""transactions_for_ticker""`: Names the partition group.
    *   `by=(ticker_symbol_val)`: Specifies that the grouping should be done based on the unique values of `ticker_symbol_val`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group (i.e., for each unique ticker symbol):
        *   `ticker_symbol_output = ticker_symbol_val`: Carries over the ticker symbol.
        *   `total_sells_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_amount)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_amount` values for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
        *   `total_costs_for_ticker = SUM(relevant_transactions_data.current_transaction_costs)`: Sums up all `current_transaction_costs` for transactions belonging to the current ticker group.
4.  `result = spm_calculation_grouped_by_ticker.CALCULATE(...)`: This final `CALCULATE` computes the SPM for each ticker.
    *   `ticker_symbol = ticker_symbol_output`: Selects the ticker symbol for the output.
    *   `SPM = IFF(...)`: Calculates the Selling Profit Margin.
        *   `IFF(total_sells_for_ticker == 0, 0.0, ...)`: This checks if `total_sells_for_ticker` is zero. If it is, SPM is set to `0.0` to prevent division by zero errors.
        *   `(total_sells_for_ticker - total_costs_for_ticker) / total_sells_for_ticker * 100.0`: If `total_sells_for_ticker` is not zero, this calculates the SPM according to the provided formula. The `100.0` ensures the result is a percentage and promotes floating-point arithmetic.

1.  **Prepare Initial Data**: Start with the `DailyPrices` collection. Create a formatted month string (YYYY-MM) from the `date` field and get the `ticker.symbol`. Keep the original `close`, `high`, and `low` prices for later aggregation.
2.  **Calculate Monthly Aggregates**: Partition the prepared data by ticker symbol and month string. For each group, calculate the average closing price, maximum high price, and minimum low price for that month.
3.  **Group by Ticker for MoMC**: Take the results from step 2 (which are monthly aggregates per ticker) and partition this data by ticker symbol. This sets up the context for the `PREV` function to work per ticker.
4.  **Calculate MoMC**: Access the monthly aggregate data within each ticker group. Use the `PREV` window function to get the average closing price of the previous month for the same ticker, ordered by month. Then, calculate MoMC using the formula: `(current_month_avg_close - prev_month_avg_close) / prev_month_avg_close`. Handle cases where the previous month's average close is null or zero to avoid errors.
5.  **Final Selection**: Select and rename the fields to match the requested output: ticker symbol, month, average closing price, highest price, lowest price, and MoMC.

Explanation:
1.  `price_info_with_month_and_symbol`: We start by accessing `DailyPrices`. For each record, we create `month_str_calc` (e.g., ""2023-01""), get the `ticker_sym_calc` from the linked `ticker` object, and store the `close`, `high`, and `low` prices with `_calc` suffixes to distinguish them.
2.  `ticker_monthly_aggregates`: This step partitions the data from `price_info_with_month_and_symbol` first by `ticker_sym_calc` and then by `month_str_calc`. Within each group (a specific ticker for a specific month), we calculate `avg_close_val`, `max_high_val`, and `min_low_val` by averaging/maxing/mining the respective `_calc` fields from the source data. The result is a collection where each row contains these monthly statistics for a ticker.
3.  `stats_grouped_by_ticker`: We take `ticker_monthly_aggregates` and partition it solely by `ticker_sym_val`. This creates groups where each group represents a single ticker, and the items within that group are all the monthly aggregate rows for that ticker from the previous step. This partition is named `ticker_group_for_momc_calc` and is crucial for the `PREV` function's `per` clause.
4.  `monthly_data_with_prev_close`: We now operate on the sub-collection of monthly aggregates within each ticker group (accessed via `stats_grouped_by_ticker.ticker_monthly_aggregates`). For each monthly record, we calculate `prev_month_avg_close_calc`. This is done using `PREV(avg_close_val, by=month_str_val.ASC(), per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc"")`. The `by` clause ensures months are ordered correctly, and `per=""ticker_group_for_momc_calc""` ensures `PREV` operates independently for each ticker (referencing the ancestor partition). If there's no previous month (e.g., the first month of data for a ticker), `prev_month_avg_close_calc` will be `NULL`.
5.  `final_report`: In the final `CALCULATE` step, we use the `prev_month_avg_close_calc` to compute `momc`. The `IFF` function handles cases where `prev_month_avg_close_calc` is `NULL` or zero, setting `momc` to `NULL` to prevent division errors. The other fields are selected and renamed to match the desired output column names: `ticker_symbol`, `month`, `average_closing_price`, `highest_price`, `lowest_price`.",116.2368471622467,"# Step 1: Prepare data by extracting month string, ticker symbol, and relevant price fields

1.  Start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  For each daily price record, calculate necessary fields:
    *   `stock_sym_calc`: The ticker symbol, accessed from the related `ticker` object (`ticker.symbol`).
    *   `price_dt_calc`: The date of the price record.
    *   `h_price_calc`: The high price for that day.
    *   `l_price_calc`: The low price for that day.
3.  Filter these records to include only those within the date range ""2023-04-01"" to ""2023-04-04"".
4.  Partition the filtered data by `stock_sym_calc`. This groups all price records for the same stock together.
5.  For each stock group (partition):
    *   Calculate `overall_max_h`: The maximum `h_price_calc` (highest high price) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   Calculate `overall_min_l`: The minimum `l_price_calc` (lowest low price) observed for that stock within the filtered date range.
    *   The `ticker_symbol_output` will be the `stock_sym_calc` for that group.
6.  Calculate `price_change_output` as `overall_max_h - overall_min_l` for each stock.
7.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=price_change_output.DESC())` to select the top 3 stocks with the largest price change in descending order.
8.  Finally, select and rename the fields to `ticker_symbol` and `price_change` for the output.

```python

        *   `(MONTH(date_time) == MONTH(join_date)) & (YEAR(date_time) == YEAR(join_date))`: This condition ensures that only transactions where the month of `date_time` matches the month of `join_date`, AND the year of `date_time` matches the year of `join_date` are considered.

**Explanation:**

1.  `dated_transactions`: This variable stores transactions filtered to be within the date range of January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023. The `DATETIME(date_time, 'start of day')` function ensures that the time component of `date_time` is ignored, making the date comparison accurate for inclusivity.
2.  `type_summary`:
    *   We partition `dated_transactions` by `transaction_type`. This groups all transactions of the same type together.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each `transaction_type`), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `transaction_type`: The type of transaction.
        *   `num_distinct_customers`: The count of unique `customer_id`s who made transactions of this type within the date range. `NDISTINCT(Transactions.customer_id)` achieves this.
        *   `avg_shares`: The average number of `shares` for transactions of this type within the date range. `AVG(Transactions.shares)` calculates this.
3.  `result`: This variable takes `type_summary` and applies `TOP_K(3, by=num_distinct_customers.DESC())`.

1.  Start with the `Tickers` collection.
2.  For each ticker, calculate two new fields:

    *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of the `amount` for all transactions associated with that ticker, derived using `SUM(transactions_of.amount)`.
3.  Use the `TOP_K` function to select the top 10 tickers. The ranking will be based on the `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.
4.  Finally, use `CALCULATE` to select and present the required fields:
    *   The original `symbol` field from the `Tickers` collection, renamed to `ticker_symbol`.
    *   The calculated `num_transactions` field, renamed to `number_of_transactions`.
    *   The calculated `total_transaction_amount` field, which will keep its name.

**Explanation:**

1.  `ticker_transaction_summary = Tickers.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `Tickers` collection.
    *   It calculates `num_transactions` by counting all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection for each ticker.
    *   It also calculates `total_transaction_amount` by summing the `amount` field from all related records in the `transactions_of` sub-collection.
    *   The original `symbol` field from `Tickers` is implicitly carried forward.

2.  `top_10_tickers_by_total_amount = ticker_transaction_summary.TOP_K(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `TOP_K(10, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`: This function takes the `ticker_transaction_summary` and selects the top 10 records based on the `total_transaction_amount` field, sorted in descending order.
    *   `.CALCULATE(ticker_symbol=symbol, number_of_transactions=num_transactions, total_transaction_amount=total_transaction_amount)`: This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output. It selects:

**Explanation:**

1.  `recent_transactions`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection to retain only transactions where the difference in days between the `date_time` of the transaction and the current timestamp (`DATETIME('now')`) is less than or equal to 30. This effectively selects transactions from the past 30 days, inclusive of 30 days ago.
2.  `transactions_with_country_details`: We then take these `recent_transactions` and use `CALCULATE` to add a new field `cust_country`, which is derived from the `country` attribute of the `customer` associated with each transaction. This step is crucial for enabling partitioning by country.
3.  `country_grouped_transactions`: This line partitions the `transactions_with_country_details` collection. The `PARTITION` function groups records by the unique values of `cust_country`.
4.  `country_transaction_summary`: After partitioning, we use `CALCULATE` on the partitioned data. For each country group:
    *   `country_name = cust_country`: The country name is taken from the partition key.
    *   `total_transaction_amount = SUM(Transactions.amount)`: This sums the `amount` from the `Transactions` collection. The `Transactions` here are implicitly those that met the initial 30-day filter and belong to the current country partition.
    *   `number_of_transactions = COUNT(Transactions)`: This counts the number of such transactions for the current country.
5.  `top_5_countries_by_transaction_volume`: Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())` is applied to `country_transaction_summary`. This selects the top 5 records (countries) ordered by `total_transaction_amount` in descending order.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:
1.  We'll start with the `DailyPrices` collection.
2.  Filter these records for the ticker symbol 'VTI'. This involves accessing the related `ticker` and its `symbol` attribute.
3.  Further filter the records to include only those from the ""past 7 days"". We interpret ""past 7 days"" as today and the 6 preceding calendar days. We'll use the `DATEDIFF` function to compare the `date` of each price record with the current date (`DATETIME('now')`). The difference should be between 0 (for today) and 6 (for 6 days ago), inclusive.
4.  From this filtered set of daily prices, we will find the minimum `close` price using the `MIN()` aggregation function.
5.  The final result will be a single value representing this lowest closing price, calculated at the `Broker` (top-level graph) scope.

```python
# Filter DailyPrices for 'VTI' and for the last 7 calendar days (today + 6 previous days)
vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(

# Calculate the lowest closing price from the filtered data
result = Broker.CALCULATE(

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `vti_prices_last_7_days = DailyPrices.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `DailyPrices` collection.
    *   `ticker.symbol == 'VTI'`: It filters for records where the associated ticker's symbol is 'VTI'.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) >= 0) & (DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`: This condition filters the records for the last 7 calendar days.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", date, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the `date` of the price record and the current moment.
        *   `>= 0` ensures the date is not in the future relative to `DATETIME('now')`.
        *   `<= 6` ensures the date is within the 6 days prior to today, or is today itself (0 days difference). This covers a total of 7 distinct calendar days.

1.  Start with the `Customers` collection.
2.  Filter out customers who do not have any transactions using `WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`.
3.  For each of these customers, we need to find the date of their first transaction. This can be achieved by:
    *   Accessing their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
    *   Using the `RANKING` window function to rank transactions by `date_time` in ascending order, partitioned per customer (`per=""Customers""`).
    *   Filtering for the transaction with rank 1.
    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to treat this single transaction record as a scalar, allowing access to its `date_time` field.
4.  Use the `DATEDIFF` function to calculate the difference in ""days"" between the customer's `join_date` and the `date_time` of their first transaction.
5.  The final `CALCULATE` will select the customer's `_id` and this calculated time difference.

```python
customer_join_to_first_transaction_diff = Customers.WHERE(

    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Customers.WHERE(HAS(transactions_made) == 1)`: This filters the `Customers` collection to include only those customers who have at least one transaction recorded in their `transactions_made` sub-collection.
*   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This function is used to define the output fields.
    *   `_id=_id`: Selects the customer's `_id`.
    *   `days_to_first_transaction=DATEDIFF(...)`: Calculates a new field named `days_to_first_transaction`.
        *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", join_date, ...)`: This function calculates the difference in days between two dates.
        *   `join_date`: This is the `join_date` field from the `Customers` collection.
        *   `transactions_made.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1).SINGULAR().date_time`: This expression retrieves the date of the customer's first transaction.
            *   `transactions_made`: Accesses the list of transactions for the current customer.
            *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=date_time.ASC(), per=""Customers"") == 1)`: Filters these transactions. The `RANKING` function assigns a rank to each transaction based on its `date_time` (ascending). `per=""Customers""` ensures this ranking is performed independently for each customer's set of transactions. We select the transaction(s) with rank 1 (the earliest).
            *   `.SINGULAR()`: Asserts that the previous filtering results in a single transaction record (the first one), allowing direct access to its fields.
            *   `.date_time`: Accesses the `date_time` field of this first transaction.",46.87350487709045,"customer_join_to_first_transaction_diff = Customers.WHERE(

**Explanation:**

1.  `transactions_prepared = Transactions.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Transactions` collection.
    *   `YEAR(date_time) == 2023`: Ensures transactions are from the year 2023.
    *   `ISIN(MONTH(date_time), (1, 2, 3))`: Filters for transactions in January, February, or March (Q1).
    *   `status == ""completed""`: Filters for successful transactions. **Note:** We are assuming ""completed"" signifies a successful transaction. If ""successful"" corresponds to a different value in the `status` field, this condition should be adjusted.
    *   `.CALCULATE(transaction_month = MONTH(date_time), transaction_price_val = price)`: This selects and prepares the data needed for the next steps. It creates a new field `transaction_month` by extracting the month from `date_time`, and it selects the `price`, renaming it to `transaction_price_val` for clarity.

2.  `monthly_average_prices = transactions_prepared.PARTITION(...)`: This line takes the `transactions_prepared` data and groups it.
    *   `name=""monthly_groups"", by=(transaction_month)`: Partitions the data by the `transaction_month`. Each group will correspond to a unique month (1, 2, or 3).
    *   `.CALCULATE(month_num = transaction_month, avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val))`: For each monthly group, this calculates:
        *   `month_num = transaction_month`: The month number for the group.
        *   `avg_price = AVG(transactions_prepared.transaction_price_val)`: The average of `transaction_price_val` for all transactions within that specific month's group.

3.  `result = monthly_average_prices.CALCULATE(...)`: This line formats the final output.
    *   `month = month_num`: Selects the month number.
    *   `average_transaction_price = avg_price`: Selects the calculated average price and gives it the requested name.
    *   `.ORDER_BY(month.ASC())`: Orders the final result by month in ascending order (January, February, March).

    *   **`s_last_name=last_name`**: Selects the salesperson's last name.
    *   **`num_sales=COUNT(sales_made.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29))`**: This calculates the number of sales made by each salesperson in the last 30 days.
        *   **`sales_made`**: Accesses the list of sales associated with the current salesperson.
        *   **`.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29)`**: Filters these sales.
            *   **`DATETIME('now')`**: Gets the current date and time.
            *   **`DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now'))`**: Calculates the difference in days between the `sale_date` of each sale and the current date.
            *   **`<= 29`**: This condition ensures that only sales made today (0 days ago) up to 29 days ago (inclusive, totaling 30 days) are included.
        *   **`COUNT(...)`**: Counts the number of sales that meet the date criteria for the current salesperson.

)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter `Cars`**:
    *   The query starts by selecting from the `Cars` collection.
    *   It filters these cars using `WHERE(LIKE(LOWER(vin_number), '%m5%'))`. This condition selects cars where their `vin_number` contains 'M5'.
        *   `LOWER(vin_number)` converts the VIN number to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
        *   `LIKE(..., '%m5%')` performs a partial match, finding 'm5' anywhere within the lowercase VIN number.

2.  **Partition by Car Model**:
    *   The filtered cars are then partitioned using `.PARTITION(name=""model_group"", by=(make, model))`.
    *   This groups the cars by unique combinations of their `make` and `model` fields. Each group in `model_group` represents a distinct car model that met the VIN criteria.

3.  **Calculate Sales per Model**:
    *   Finally, `.CALCULATE(...)` is applied to each group created by the partition.
    *   `car_make=make`: Selects the `make` of the car model (which is a partitioning key).
    *   `car_model=model`: Selects the `model` of the car model (also a partitioning key).
    *   `num_sales=COUNT(Cars.sale_records)`: Calculates the total number of sales for each car model group.
        *   `Cars` within this `CALCULATE` refers to the sub-collection of cars belonging to the current (make, model) partition.
        *   `Cars.sale_records` accesses all sale records associated with these cars.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts these sale records to get the total number of sales for that specific car make and model.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter these sales to include only those where the `car.make` is ""Toyota"".
3.  Further filter these sales to include only those where the `sale_date` falls within the last 30 days, inclusive of the current date. This is achieved using `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current timestamp.

    *   The condition `<= 29` ensures we include today (0 days diff) up to 29 days ago, covering a 30-day period.
4.  Use the `Dealership` (graph-level) `CALCULATE` to compute two aggregates:

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the required metrics at the `Dealership` graph level.
- It first defines a common filter for `Sales` records:
    - `Sales.car.make == ""Toyota""`: Ensures only sales of Toyota cars are considered.
    - `DATEDIFF(""days"", Sales.sale_date, DATETIME('now')) <= 29`: Filters sales to the last 30 days, including today. `DATEDIFF` calculates the difference in days between the sale date and the current date. A value of 0 means the sale occurred today, and 29 means it occurred 29 days ago.
- `COUNT(...)`: Counts the number of sales records that satisfy both conditions. This result is assigned to `number_of_sales`.
- `SUM(...).sale_price`: Sums the `sale_price` of the sales records that satisfy both conditions. This result is assigned to `total_revenue`.

1.  Start with the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  Calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson by summing the `sale_price` from their `sales_made` records.
3.  Calculate the number of sales for each salesperson by counting their `sales_made` records.
4.  Assign a sales rank (SR) to each salesperson based on their total sales amount in descending order. Salespersons with higher total sales will receive a lower rank number (e.g., rank 1 for the highest).
5.  Select the salesperson's `first_name`, `last_name`, the calculated `total_sales_amount`, `number_of_sales`, and `SR`.

Two `CALCULATE` steps are used: the first to compute total sales and number of sales, and the second to compute the rank based on these calculated values and to format the final output fields.

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Salespersons.CALCULATE(...)`: This first `CALCULATE` call processes the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sp_first_name=first_name`, `sp_last_name=last_name`: Selects the first and last names of the salespersons, renaming them to avoid conflicts in subsequent calculations.
    *   `calc_total_sales=SUM(sales_made.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales associated with each salesperson via the `sales_made` sub-collection. This sum is stored as `calc_total_sales`.
    *   `calc_num_sales=COUNT(sales_made)`: Counts the number of sales records in the `sales_made` sub-collection for each salesperson, storing it as `calc_num_sales`.

2.  `sales_data.CALCULATE(...)`: This second `CALCULATE` call takes the output of the first (`sales_data`) and performs further calculations and field selection.
    *   `first_name=sp_first_name`, `last_name=sp_last_name`: Passes through the salesperson's first and last names, renaming them to the final requested field names.
    *   `total_sales_amount=calc_total_sales`: Assigns the previously calculated total sales to the final field name `total_sales_amount`.
    *   `number_of_sales=calc_num_sales`: Assigns the previously calculated number of sales to the final field name `number_of_sales`.
    *   `SR=RANKING(by=calc_total_sales.DESC())`: Calculates the sales rank (`SR`) for each salesperson. The `RANKING` function is applied to the `calc_total_sales` field in descending order (`DESC()`), so the salesperson with the highest total sales gets rank 1.

Explanation:
-   `Cars.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Cars` collection.
    -   `LIKE(LOWER(make), '%ford%')`: This condition checks if the lowercase `make` of the car contains ""ford"". The `LIKE` operator with `%` wildcards allows for partial matches (e.g., ""Ford"", ""NewFord"", ""FordMotors"" would all match if ""ford"" is present). `LOWER` ensures the match is case-insensitive.
    -   `LIKE(LOWER(model), '%mustang%')`: Similarly, this checks if the lowercase `model` of the car contains ""mustang"".
    -   `|`: The OR operator combines these two conditions, so a car is selected if its make contains 'ford' OR its model contains 'mustang'.
-   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each car that meets the filter criteria, this function computes the specified output fields.
    -   `car_make=make`, `car_model=model`, `car_year=year`, `car_color=color`, `car_vin_number=vin_number`: These select the respective details of the car.
    -   `avg_sale_price=AVG(sale_records.sale_price)`: This calculates the average sale price for the car. `sale_records` is a sub-collection of sales associated with the car, and `sale_price` is the price from each sale.

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We need sales from the last 6 full months. This period starts from the beginning of the month, 6 months prior to the current month, and ends at the beginning of the current month.
2.  **Identify Relevant Months**: We first find all unique months within this time window that have any sales activity at all. This forms the basis for our report, ensuring that we consider every month in the period that has data.
3.  **Filter Salespersons**: We are interested in salespersons hired in 2022 or 2023.
4.  **Calculate Metrics**: For each identified month, we will:
    *   Count the number of sales (PMSPS) made by the filtered salespersons.
    *   Sum the sale prices (PMSR) from sales made by the filtered salespersons.
    If a month had sales activity in general but none from the specified salespersons, PMSPS and PMSR for that month will correctly be 0.
5.  **Order Results**: The final output will be ordered by month in ascending order.

This approach ensures that any month within the last six months that had *any* sales recorded will be listed, and the metrics PMSPS and PMSR will be calculated specifically for the defined group of salespersons. If this group had no sales in one of these active months, the metrics will be zero for that month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_val` and `end_period_val` define the date range for the last six full months, excluding the current month. For example, if ""now"" is July 15th, 2024, this range would be from January 1st, 2024, up to (but not including) July 1st, 2024.
2.  `report_months_base`:
    *   First, we take all `Sales` and calculate `sale_month_dt` by truncating `sale_date` to the start of its month.
    *   We filter these to include only sales falling within our defined 6-month window (`start_period_val` to `end_period_val`).
    *   Then, we use `PARTITION` by `sale_month_dt` and `CALCULATE month_val = sale_month_dt` to get a distinct list of months within the window that had at least one sale (from any salesperson). This forms the set of months for our report.
3.  `result`:
    *   We iterate over each `month_val` from `report_months_base`.
    *   For each `month_val`, we calculate:
        *   `month`: This is simply `month_val`, representing the month of the report row.
        *   `PMSPS`: We count records in the `Sales` collection. These sales must satisfy two conditions:
            1.  Their `sale_date` (truncated to the month) matches the current `month_val`.
            2.  The sale was made by a salesperson whose `hire_date` year is between 2022 and 2023, inclusive.
        *   `PMSR`: We sum the `sale_price` of sales records meeting the same two conditions as for `PMSPS`.
    *   If, for a given `month_val`, no sales meet these criteria (e.g., sales in that month were not by the specified salespersons), `COUNT` will be 0 and `SUM` will effectively be 0, satisfying the requirement to include months where metrics are 0.
4.  Finally, the results are ordered by `month` in ascending order.",124.94846653938292,"# Define the start and end of the 6-month period (excluding the current month)

**Explanation:**

1.  **`PaymentsReceived.CALCULATE(days_difference=DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date))`**:

    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_record.sale_date, payment_date)` calculates the number of full days between the `sale_date` of the sale and the `payment_date` of the payment. This difference is stored in a temporary calculated field named `days_difference`.

2.  **`AVG(...)`**:
    *   The `AVG()` function then calculates the average of all the `days_difference` values computed in the previous step across all payment records.

What is the GPM for all car sales in 2023?GPM (gross profit margin) = (total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100,"SELECT (SUM(sale_price) - SUM(cars.cost)) / SUM(cars.cost) * 100 AS gpm FROM sales JOIN cars ON sales.car_id = cars._id WHERE strftime('%Y', sale_date) = '2023';",Dealership,"To calculate the Gross Profit Margin (GPM) for all car sales in 2023, we need to:
1.  Identify all sales that occurred in the year 2023.
2.  Calculate the total revenue from these sales. Total revenue is the sum of `sale_price` for these sales.
3.  Calculate the total cost associated with these sales. Total cost is the sum of `cost` for the cars sold.
4.  Apply the GPM formula: `(total revenue - total cost) / total cost * 100`.

The PyDough code will first calculate the total revenue and total cost for sales in 2023. Then, it will use these values in a subsequent `CALCULATE` step to compute the GPM.

```python
gpm_calculation = Dealership.CALCULATE(
    # Calculate total revenue from sales made in 2023
    total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price),

)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the top-level `Dealership` collection because we need to compute aggregate values (total revenue and total cost) across all relevant sales.
2.  `total_revenue_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).sale_price)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: This filters the `Sales` collection to include only sales made in the year 2023.
    *   `.sale_price`: For these filtered sales, it accesses their `sale_price`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `sale_price` of all sales in 2023 to get the `total_revenue_2023`.
3.  `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 = SUM(Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023).car.cost)`:
    *   `Sales.WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`: Again, filters sales for the year 2023.
    *   `.car.cost`: For each sale in 2023, it navigates to the related `car` (from the `Cars` collection) and accesses its `cost`.
    *   `SUM(...)`: This aggregates the `cost` of all cars sold in 2023 to get the `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023`.
4.  `.CALCULATE(gpm_for_2023 = ...)`: This second `CALCULATE` step takes the `total_revenue_2023` and `total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023` computed in the first step.
5.  `gpm_for_2023 = (total_revenue_2023 - total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023) / total_cost_of_cars_sold_2023 * 100`: This applies the GPM formula to calculate the gross profit margin for 2023 sales.

1.  Filter the `Sales` collection to find sales where the car was sold on the same day it was marked as out of inventory. This involves:
    *   Accessing the `car` associated with each sale.
    *   Checking the `inventory_snapshots` for that car.
    *   Verifying if there's an `InventorySnapshots` record where the `snapshot_date` matches the `sale_date` and `is_in_inventory` is `False`.
2.  From these filtered sales, select the one with the highest `sale_price` using `TOP_K`.
3.  Extract the `make` and `model` from the car associated with this top sale, and the `sale_price` from the sale itself.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_on_inventory_out_day = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line starts by taking all records from the `Sales` collection and filters them.
    *   `HAS(car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if for each sale, the associated car (`sale.car`) has at least one inventory snapshot (`car.inventory_snapshots`) that meets specific criteria.
    *   `car.inventory_snapshots.WHERE((snapshot_date == sale_date) & (is_in_inventory == False))`: This inner part filters the inventory snapshots for the car.
        *   `snapshot_date == sale_date`: It ensures the inventory snapshot was recorded on the same day as the sale.
        *   `is_in_inventory == False`: It ensures the car was marked as out of inventory on that day.
    *   Only sales that satisfy this condition (i.e., were sold on the day they were marked out of inventory) are kept in `sales_on_inventory_out_day`.

2.  `highest_priced_sale_info = sales_on_inventory_out_day.TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())`:
    *   This line takes the filtered sales (cars sold on the day they went out of inventory).
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=sale_price.DESC())` selects the single sale record (`1`) that has the highest `sale_price` (ordered in descending order).

3.  `result = highest_priced_sale_info.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line takes the single, highest-priced sale record found in the previous step.
    *   `CALCULATE(make=car.make, model=car.model, sale_price=sale_price)` extracts the required information:
        *   `make=car.make`: Retrieves the `make` of the car associated with the sale.
        *   `model=car.model`: Retrieves the `model` of the car.

**Explanation:**

The PyDough code calculates the total payments received per month and the month-over-month (MoM) change.

1.  **Data Preparation (`payments_info`):**
    *   It starts with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   For each payment record, it extracts the `payment_year_val` (year) and `payment_month_val` (month) from the `payment_date` field using the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions.

2.  **Monthly Aggregation (`monthly_aggregated_payments`):**
    *   The `payments_info` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""monthly_payment_groups"", by=(payment_year_val, payment_month_val))`. This groups the payment records by unique year-month combinations.
    *   For each group (i.e., for each month), `CALCULATE` is used to:
        *   Output the `output_year` (which is `payment_year_val`) and `output_month` (which is `payment_month_val`).
        *   Calculate `total_monthly_amount` by summing `payment_amount` for all payments within that specific year-month group using `SUM(PaymentsReceived.payment_amount)`.
    *   The results are then ordered chronologically using `ORDER_BY(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC())`. This sorting is crucial for the correct operation of the `PREV` function in the next step.

3.  **MoM Change Calculation (`result`):**
    *   This final `CALCULATE` step operates on the `monthly_aggregated_payments` collection.
    *   It includes `output_year`, `output_month`, and `total_monthly_amount` from the previous step.
    *   It calculates `month_over_month_change` using the formula: `total_monthly_amount - PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))`.
        *   `PREV(total_monthly_amount, by=(output_year.ASC(), output_month.ASC()))` fetches the `total_monthly_amount` from the immediately preceding month in the ordered dataset.
        *   For the earliest month in the dataset, `PREV` will return `None` (or a similar null equivalent), resulting in `month_over_month_change` being `None` for that first month, which is appropriate as there's no prior month to compare against.

The query will return results for each month that has payment records. Months with absolutely no payment records in the `PaymentsReceived` collection will not be listed in the output. The final output includes the year, month, total payments for that month, and the calculated MoM change.",61.15295648574829,"# Step 1: Calculate year and month for each payment record.

1.  Access the `Sales` collection.
2.  Filter the sales records where the `sale_date` falls within the last 7 days. We can use the `DATEDIFF` function to achieve this. `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now')` will give us the number of days between the `sale_date` and the current date.
    *   If `sale_date` is today, the difference is 0.
    *   If `sale_date` was 6 days ago, the difference is 6.
    *   So, we need records where this difference is between 0 and 6 (inclusive).
3.  Count the number of sales records that meet this date criteria.

Explanation:
1.  `sales_in_last_7_days = Sales.WHERE(...)`: This line filters the `Sales` collection.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') >= 0`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is not in the future relative to 'now'.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", sale_date, 'now') <= 6`: Ensures that the `sale_date` is within the last 6 days from 'now' (inclusive of 'now', making it a 7-day window).
    *   The `&` operator combines these conditions, so only sales within this 7-day period are selected.
2.  `total_sales_count_past_7_days = Dealership.CALCULATE(TSC = COUNT(sales_in_last_7_days))`: This line calculates the final result.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Salespersons`**: We start by accessing the `Salespersons` collection.
2.  **`.WHERE(HASNOT(sales_made)==1)`**: This filters the `Salespersons` collection.
    *   `sales_made` is the sub-collection linking salespersons to their sales records.
    *   `HASNOT(sales_made)==1` checks if the `sales_made` sub-collection is empty for each salesperson. It returns `True` (or 1) if the salesperson has no sales records.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(salesperson_id=_id, s_first_name=first_name, s_last_name=last_name)`**: This step selects and renames the desired fields for the salespersons who met the filter criteria:

    *   `sales_in_last_30_days_count`: The total count of sales. This is achieved by filtering `sales_made` where the `sale_date` is within the last 30 days (using `DATEDIFF` with `DATETIME('now')`) and then applying `COUNT`.
    *   `revenue_in_last_30_days`: The total revenue from these sales. This is done by summing the `sale_price` of the same filtered sales.

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sales_info = Sales.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Sales` collection. For each sale, we retrieve the `make` and `model` of the associated car using `car.make` and `car.model`. These are stored as new temporary fields `car_mk` and `car_mdl` in the `sales_info` collection. The original `sale_price` from each sale is implicitly carried over.

2.  `model_summary = sales_info.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   We then `PARTITION` the `sales_info` collection. The `by=(car_mk, car_mdl)` clause groups the sales records by unique combinations of car make and model.
    *   Within each group (partition), the `CALCULATE` function computes:
        *   `make = car_mk`: The make of the car for the current group.
        *   `model = car_mdl`: The model of the car for the current group.
        *   `total_number_of_sales = COUNT(Sales)`: This counts the number of sales records belonging to the current make/model group.
        *   `total_revenue = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: This sums the `sale_price` of all sales records in the current make/model group, giving the total revenue for that car model.

3.  `result = model_summary.TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())`: Finally, `TOP_K(5, by=total_revenue.DESC())` is applied to the `model_summary`. This sorts all car models by their `total_revenue` in descending order and selects the top 5, effectively giving us the 5 best-selling car models by revenue.

**Explanation:**

1.  `start_period_date` and `end_period_date`: These contextless expressions define the 3-month window. `DATETIME('now', '-3 months')` gets the date 3 months ago, and `'start of day'` truncates it to the beginning of that day. `DATETIME('now', 'start of day')` represents today's date at midnight. The filter `(sale_date >= start_period_date) & (sale_date <= end_period_date)` includes all sales made on or after the start date and on or before the end date.

**Explanation:**

1.  `date_info = Dealership.CALCULATE(...)`: This step calculates two dynamic dates:
    *   `prev_week_start_date_calc`: Determines the Monday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week (`DATETIME('now', 'start of week')`) and subtracts 7 days.
    *   `prev_week_end_date_calc`: Determines the Sunday of the week immediately preceding the current week. It takes the Monday of the current week and subtracts 1 day.
    These dates define the full previous ISO week.

2.  `payments_for_grouping = date_info.PaymentsReceived.WHERE(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PaymentsReceived`: We start with the `PaymentsReceived` collection.
    *   `.WHERE((payment_date >= prev_week_start_date_calc) & (payment_date <= prev_week_end_date_calc))`: This filters the payments to include only those whose `payment_date` falls within the calculated start and end dates of the previous week.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: This step prepares the data for grouping:
        *   `payment_day_extracted = DATETIME(payment_date, 'start of day')`: Creates a new field representing the calendar day of the payment by truncating the `payment_date` to its beginning (midnight). This is crucial for daily aggregation.
        *   `payment_method_from_data = payment_method`: Aliases `payment_method` for clarity in subsequent steps.
        *   `payment_amount_from_data = payment_amount`: Aliases `payment_amount` for clarity.

3.  `result = payments_for_grouping.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...).ORDER_BY(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""daily_method_group"", by=(payment_day_extracted, payment_method_from_data))`: This groups the `payments_for_grouping` data. Each group will consist of payments that occurred on the same `payment_day_extracted` and have the same `payment_method_from_data`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each group created by the `PARTITION`:
        *   `transaction_date = payment_day_extracted`: Selects the day for the group.
        *   `payment_method_type = payment_method_from_data`: Selects the payment method for the group.
        *   `total_daily_amount_by_method = SUM(payments_for_grouping.payment_amount_from_data)`: Calculates the sum of `payment_amount_from_data` for all payments within the current group (i.e., for that specific day and payment method).
    *   `.ORDER_BY(transaction_date.ASC(), payment_method_type.ASC())`: Sorts the final results first by the transaction date in ascending order, and then by payment method type, also in ascending order. This makes the output easy to read.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Filter and Prepare Data (`sales_data_for_partition`):**
    *   The query starts by accessing the `Sales` collection.
    *   It filters these sales to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 using `WHERE(YEAR(sale_date) == 2023)`.
    *   In the `CALCULATE` step, two new fields are derived for each sale:
        *   `c_state`: This extracts the `state` from the `customer` associated with the sale (`customer.state`).
        *   `q_start_date`: This determines the first day of the quarter for the `sale_date`. It uses nested `IFF` functions and `ISIN` to check the month of the sale:
            *   Months 1, 2, 3 (Q1) map to ""2023-01-01"".
            *   Months 4, 5, 6 (Q2) map to ""2023-04-01"".
            *   Months 7, 8, 9 (Q3) map to ""2023-07-01"".
            *   Months 10, 11, 12 (Q4) map to ""2023-10-01"".
    *   The `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records is implicitly available for aggregation in the next step.

2.  **Partition and Aggregate (`result`):**
    *   The `sales_data_for_partition` collection is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""quarterly_sales_groups"", by=(c_state, q_start_date))`. This groups the sales data by unique combinations of customer state (`c_state`) and the calculated quarter start date (`q_start_date`).
    *   After partitioning, another `CALCULATE` step is applied to each group:
        *   `customer_state = c_state`: Selects the customer state for the group.
        *   `quarter_start_date = q_start_date`: Selects the quarter start date for the group.
        *   `total_sales = SUM(Sales.sale_price)`: Calculates the sum of `sale_price` for all sales within that specific customer state and quarter. The `SUM(Sales.sale_price)` aggregates the `sale_price` from the original `Sales` records belonging to each partition group.

The final `result` will contain rows, each representing a unique customer state and quarter in 2023, along with the total sales amount for that combination.",56.94295692443848,"# Step 1: Filter sales for the year 2023 and prepare data for partitioning.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection, as we need to calculate a value for each drug.
2.  For each drug, we will calculate its name and the average DDD.
3.  To calculate the average DDD for a drug, we look at its `treatments_used_in`.
4.  For each treatment, we first filter out those where the `end_dt` is null, as specified in the DDD definition.
5.  We then calculate the duration of each treatment in days using `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`. We only consider treatments with a duration greater than 0 to avoid division by zero and ensure meaningful ""days of treatment"".
6.  For these valid treatments, we calculate the DDD as `tot_drug_amt / duration_days`.
7.  Finally, we take the average of these individual treatment DDD values for each drug using the `AVG` aggregation function.

The resulting PyDough code is:

        ).ddd_for_treatment
    )
)
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start with the `Drugs` collection and use `CALCULATE` to output the `drug_name` and the computed `average_ddd` for each drug.
*   `drug_name=drug_name`: Selects the name of the drug.
*   `average_ddd=AVG(...)`: Calculates the average DDD. The `AVG` function aggregates values derived from the `treatments_used_in` sub-collection for each drug.
*   `treatments_used_in.WHERE(...)`: Filters the treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `(HASNOT(end_dt) == 0)`: This condition ensures that `end_dt` (end date of the treatment) is not null. `HASNOT(field) == 0` means the field is present/not null.
    *   `(DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt) > 0)`: This condition ensures that the treatment duration is positive. `DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)` calculates the number of days between the start and end dates.
*   `.CALCULATE(ddd_for_treatment=tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt))`: For each treatment that passes the `WHERE` filter, this calculates its individual DDD.
    *   `ddd_for_treatment = tot_drug_amt / DATEDIFF(""days"", start_dt, end_dt)`: This is the DDD formula: total drug amount divided by the treatment duration in days.
*   `.ddd_for_treatment`: This projects the calculated `ddd_for_treatment` value from the inner `CALCULATE` so that `AVG` can operate on these scalar DDD values. If a drug has no treatments meeting the criteria, `AVG` will likely return null.",40.83045125007629,"avg_ddd_per_drug = Drugs.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define Date Boundaries**:
    *   We first establish the time window of interest: the last three full months, excluding the current month.
    *   `current_month_start_dt` marks the end of our window (exclusive).
    *   `three_months_ago_start_dt` marks the beginning of our window (inclusive). These are calculated dynamically using `DATETIME('now', ...)` relative to the current date.

2.  **Filter and Prepare Treatment Data (`treatments_in_period`)**:
    *   We access the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `WHERE` clause filters treatments whose `start_dt` falls within the defined three-month window.
    *   `CALCULATE` then processes these filtered treatments:
        *   `treatment_month_year_key`: A string like ""YYYY-MM"" is created from `start_dt` (e.g., ""2023-09"") to serve as a key for grouping treatments by month. `LPAD` ensures months are two digits (e.g., ""09"" instead of ""9"") for correct sorting.
        *   `p_id`: The `patient_id` is extracted.
        *   `is_biologic_treatment_flag`: A boolean flag is set to `True` if the treatment's associated drug (`drug.drug_type`) is 'biologic', and `False` otherwise.

3.  **Partition by Month and Aggregate (`monthly_aggregated_data`)**:
    *   The `treatments_in_period` data is then partitioned using `PARTITION(name=""treatments_per_month"", by=(treatment_month_year_key))`. This groups all treatments by their `treatment_month_year_key`.
    *   Within each monthly group, `CALCULATE` computes the required aggregates:
        *   `month_label`: This is the `treatment_month_year_key` (e.g., ""2023-09""), representing the month for which the counts are calculated.
        *   `distinct_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.p_id)` counts the number of unique patient IDs within that month's group. This gives the total number of distinct patients who received any treatment in that month.
        *   `biologic_treatment_patient_count_val`: `NDISTINCT(treatments_per_month.WHERE(is_biologic_treatment_flag == True).p_id)` first filters the treatments within the monthly group to include only those where `is_biologic_treatment_flag` is `True`. Then, it counts the number of unique patient IDs from this subset. This gives the number of distinct patients who received at least one biologic drug treatment in that month.

4.  **Order Results (`result`)**:
    *   Finally, `ORDER_BY(month_label.ASC())` sorts the aggregated results chronologically by month.

The query will output three rows (one for each of the last three relevant months), each containing the month, the total count of distinct patients treated in that month, and the count of distinct patients who received biologic drug treatments in that month.",54.13363242149353,"# Define date boundaries for the last 3 months, excluding the current month

Explanation:
- We start with the `DermTreatment` high-level collection to perform a global calculation.
- `Patients.WHERE(...)`: This filters the `Patients` collection.
- `HAS(treatments_received.WHERE(...)) == 1`: This condition checks if a patient has at least one treatment record that satisfies the inner `WHERE` clause.
  - `treatments_received.WHERE((diagnosis.diag_name == 'Psoriasis vulgaris') & (drug.drug_type == 'Biologic'))`: This filters the treatments for each patient.

    - `drug.drug_type == 'Biologic'`: Checks if the drug type used in the treatment is 'Biologic'.
    - The `&` operator combines these two conditions, meaning both must be true for a treatment to be included.

    *   The start of the window (inclusive) is 6 months prior to the start of the current month. This can be calculated using `DATETIME(DATETIME('now', 'start of month'), '-6 months')`.

2.  **Filter Treatments by Date**: Select treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined time window.

2.  **`.WHERE(treatment.drug.drug_type == ""Topical"")`**: This filters the adverse events.
    *   `treatment`: For each adverse event, we access its associated `treatment` record.
    *   `drug`: From the `treatment` record, we access its associated `drug` record.
    *   `drug_type == ""Topical""`: We then check if the `drug_type` of this drug is ""Topical"". Only adverse events linked to treatments using topical drugs will be kept.
3.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: This function selects and renames the fields for the final output.

1.  **Calculate Distinct Drug Counts**: For each doctor, calculate the number of distinct drugs they have prescribed. This is done by navigating from `Doctors` to `prescribed_treatments`, then to the associated `drug`, and counting the distinct `drug_id`s. We'll store this along with `doc_id` and `speciality`.
2.  **Partition by Specialty**: Group the doctors by their `speciality`. This creates logical groups within which ranking will occur.
3.  **Rank within Specialty**: For each doctor within their specialty group, calculate their rank (`SDRSDR`) based on the number of distinct drugs prescribed. The ranking will be in descending order of distinct drug counts (more drugs = higher rank, i.e., rank 1). We'll allow ties, meaning doctors with the same count in the same specialty will receive the same rank.
4.  **Select Final Fields**: Output the `doc_id`, `speciality`, the calculated `num_distinct_drugs`, and the `SDRSDR`.

2.  `result = doctors_with_drug_counts.PARTITION(...).doctors_with_drug_counts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""specialty_group"", by=(speciality))`: This takes the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection and partitions it into groups based on the `speciality` field. Each group is named `specialty_group`.
    *   `.doctors_with_drug_counts`: After partitioning, this accesses the individual doctor records (which are items from the `doctors_with_drug_counts` collection) within each `specialty_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)`: For each doctor record within its specialty group, this calculates the final output fields:
        *   `doc_id`: The doctor's ID (from the item).

1.  **Define the Time Window**: We first determine the relevant 12-month period. This period starts from the first day of the month 12 months prior to the current month and ends on the last day of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if the current date is July 15, 2024, the window will span from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
2.  **Filter Treatments**: We select all treatments whose `start_dt` falls within this defined 12-month window.
3.  **Prepare for Aggregation**: For each selected treatment, we extract the year and month from its `start_dt`. These will serve as keys for grouping. This step effectively truncates the `start_dt` to the month level as requested.
4.  **Group by Month**: We partition the filtered and prepared treatments by year and month. This creates distinct groups, each representing one month within our 12-month window.
5.  **Calculate Metrics**:
    *   **PMPD (Per Month Patient Diagnoses)**: For each monthly group, we count the number of unique `patient_id` values associated with the treatments in that month. This represents the number of distinct patients who received a diagnosis (as implied by a treatment record) during that month.
    *   **PMTC (Per Month Treatment Count)**: For each monthly group, we count the total number of treatment records. This gives the total treatments administered in that month.
6.  **Format and Order**: We format the year and month into a ""YYYY-MM"" string for clear presentation and order the results chronologically.

The final output will list each of the last 12 months along with its corresponding PMPD and PMTC values.

2.  **Filter for First Treatments**: Keep only those treatments that are identified as a patient's first treatment. Each record at this stage represents a patient becoming ""new"" to the system.
3.  **Determine Year of First Treatment**: For each of these first treatments, extract the year from its `start_dt`. This is the year the patient became a ""new patient"".
4.  **Count New Patients Per Year**: Group the records from the previous step by the `year_of_first_treatment`. Count the number of unique patients in each year's group. This gives `num_new_patients` for each year.
5.  **Calculate NPI**: Order the yearly counts by year. For each year, calculate NPI as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the previous year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function is used here. For the earliest year in the data, NPI will be `None` as there's no preceding year for comparison.

**Explanation:**

1.  `patient_treatment_ranks`: We start by looking at each patient's list of received treatments (`Patients.treatments_received`). For each treatment, we calculate its rank (`rank_for_patient`) based on the `start_dt`. The `per=""Patients""` ensures this ranking is done independently for each patient. We also carry forward necessary fields like `treatment_id`, the patient's ID (`patient.patient_id`), and the `start_dt`.
2.  `first_treatments_details`: We filter the ranked treatments to keep only those with `rank_for_patient == 1`. This gives us a list where each row represents a patient's very first treatment.
3.  `new_patient_event_year`: From these first treatment records, we extract the `patient_id` and the year (`year_val`) of the `treatment_start_dt_field`. Each row now signifies a patient becoming ""new"" in a specific year.
4.  `yearly_new_patients_count`: We then `PARTITION` (group) these ""new patient events"" by `year_val`. In the `CALCULATE` step, `year_of_new_patients` is the year of the group, and `num_new_patients` is the `COUNT` of `patient_id`s in that group. Since each `patient_id` in `new_patient_event_year` is unique (due to the rank 1 filter), this count gives the number of new patients for that year.
5.  `npi_final_output`: Finally, we take the `yearly_new_patients_count`, order it by year (`year_of_new_patients.ASC()`), and then `CALCULATE` the required output fields:
    *   `year`: The year.
    *   `num_new_patients`: The number of new patients in that year.
    *   `npi`: The New Patients Increase, calculated as the current year's `num_new_patients` minus the `PREV`ious year's `num_new_patients`. The `PREV` function correctly handles the ordering by year. If there's no previous year (i.e., for the earliest year in the data), `PREV` returns `None`, making the `npi` also `None`.",86.81501770019531,"# Step 1: Access treatments for each patient and rank them by start date

1.  **Identify Valid Outcomes**: The calculation should only include outcomes where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are non-null. We'll create a filtered collection of these valid outcomes.
2.  **Calculate Average PASI Scores**:
    *   Calculate the average `day7_pasi_score` from these valid outcomes.
    *   Calculate the average `day100_pasi_score` from these valid outcomes.

**Explanation:**

1.  `valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc = Outcomes.WHERE(...)`: This line defines a subset of the `Outcomes` collection. It filters for records where both `day7_pasi_score` and `day100_pasi_score` are not null, as per the requirement.
2.  `pir_calculation_steps = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(...)`: This starts a calculation at the highest level of the database (`DermTreatment`) to compute global statistics.
    *   `avg_pasi_d7 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc.day7_pasi_score)`: Calculates the average of `day7_pasi_score` across all outcomes present in the `valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc` collection.
    *   `avg_pasi_d100 = AVG(valid_outcomes_for_pasi_calc.day100_pasi_score)`: Similarly, calculates the average of `day100_pasi_score`.
3.  `.CALCULATE(calculated_d7d100pir = IFF(...))`: This subsequent `CALCULATE` uses the averages computed in the previous step to apply the D7D100PIR formula.
    *   `IFF(avg_pasi_d7 == 0, None, ...)`: This conditional logic checks if `avg_pasi_d7` is zero. If it is, `None` is returned for the PIR to avoid division by zero. Otherwise, the formula `(avg_pasi_d100 - avg_pasi_d7) / avg_pasi_d7 * 100.0` is computed. The `100.0` ensures the result is a float and represents a percentage.
4.  `result = pir_calculation_steps.CALCULATE(D7D100PIR_percentage = calculated_d7d100pir)`: This final `CALCULATE` selects only the `calculated_d7d100pir` value and renames it to `D7D100PIR_percentage`, which is the requested output.

We need to return the drug's ID, name, and this count of adverse events.

Here's how we can construct the PyDough query:

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, we need to calculate the total number of relevant adverse events. This total will be a sum over all treatments associated with that drug.
3.  For each `treatment` associated with a drug (via `treatments_used_in`):
    a.  Determine the year and month of the treatment's `start_dt`. We'll create intermediate fields `treatment_start_yr` and `treatment_start_mth` for this.
    b.  Access the `adverse_events` for this specific treatment.
    c.  Filter these adverse events to include only those where the `reported_dt` falls within the same year and month as the treatment's `start_dt` (i.e., `YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr` and `MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth`).
    d.  Count these filtered adverse events for the current treatment. Let's call this `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`.
4.  Sum these counts (`count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`) across all treatments for the current drug. This gives the total number of relevant adverse events for the drug, which we'll call `num_adv_events`.
5.  After calculating `num_adv_events` for every drug, use `TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())` to find the drug with the highest count.
6.  The final result should include the drug's ID (`drug_id`), name (`drug_name`), and the calculated `num_adv_events`.

This requires nested calculations: an outer `CALCULATE` on `Drugs` to compute `num_adv_events`, and inner `CALCULATE` operations on `treatments_used_in` to determine the count for each treatment before summing them up. Due to the rule that new fields defined in a `CALCULATE` are only available after it completes, we'll need two chained `CALCULATE` calls on `treatments_used_in`.

```python
result = Drugs.CALCULATE(
    d_id = drug_id,
    d_name = drug_name,
    num_adv_events = SUM(
        treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(

            treatment_start_yr = YEAR(start_dt),

```
**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: We start by iterating over each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `d_id = drug_id`: Selects the drug's ID.
    *   `d_name = drug_name`: Selects the drug's name.
    *   `num_adv_events = SUM(...)`: This calculates the total number of relevant adverse events for the current drug. The `SUM` function aggregates counts derived from each associated treatment.

2.  `treatments_used_in.CALCULATE(...)`: This first inner `CALCULATE` operates on the collection of treatments associated with the current drug.
    *   `treatment_start_yr = YEAR(start_dt)`: Extracts the year from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    *   `treatment_start_mth = MONTH(start_dt)`: Extracts the month from the `start_dt` of each treatment.
    These fields (`treatment_start_yr`, `treatment_start_mth`) are now available for the subsequent `CALCULATE`.

3.  `.CALCULATE(...)`: This second inner `CALCULATE` (chained after the first one on `treatments_used_in`) still operates on each treatment.
    *   `count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment = COUNT(...)`: For each treatment, this counts its adverse events that meet the specified date criteria.
    *   `adverse_events.WHERE(...)`: Filters the `adverse_events` sub-collection of the current treatment.
        *   `(YEAR(reported_dt) == treatment_start_yr) & (MONTH(reported_dt) == treatment_start_mth)`: This condition ensures that the adverse event's `reported_dt` is in the same calendar month and year as the treatment's `start_dt`.

4.  `.count_of_matching_aes_for_this_treatment`: This refers to the result of the `COUNT` operation from the second inner `CALCULATE`. The `SUM` function in the outer `CALCULATE` (on `Drugs`) aggregates these per-treatment counts to get the total for the drug.

5.  `.TOP_K(1, by=num_adv_events.DESC())`: After calculating `d_id`, `d_name`, and `num_adv_events` for all drugs, this function selects the single drug that has the highest `num_adv_events`, ordering in descending order.",50.166579246521,"result = Drugs.CALCULATE(

1.  Start with the `Doctors` collection.

3.  From this filtered list of doctors, we are interested in their `loc_state`.
4.  To get the distinct states, we partition the filtered doctors by their `loc_state`.
5.  Finally, we select the `loc_state` from each partition, which will give us a unique list of states.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Doctors.WHERE(HAS(prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')) == 1)`:
    *   This part filters the `Doctors` collection.
    *   `prescribed_treatments.WHERE(drug.drug_type == 'Biologic')`: For each doctor, this filters their prescribed treatments to only those where the associated drug's `drug_type` is 'Biologic'.
    *   `HAS(...) == 1`: This checks if a doctor has at least one such treatment (i.e., the filtered list of treatments is not empty).
    *   The result is a collection of doctors who have prescribed at least one biologic drug.

2.  `.PARTITION(name=""unique_states_partition"", by=(loc_state))`:
    *   This takes the previously filtered collection of doctors.
    *   It groups these doctors based on their `loc_state`. Each group corresponds to a unique state.

3.  `.CALCULATE(state_residence=loc_state)`:

1.  Filter the `Treatments` collection for records where the `end_dt` falls within the year 2022.
2.  For these filtered treatments, we need to access the patient's insurance type (`patient.ins_type`) to use as a partitioning key. We'll create a temporary calculated field for this.

**Explanation:**

1.  `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type`: This line starts by accessing the `Treatments` collection.
    *   `.WHERE(YEAR(end_dt) == 2022)` filters these treatments to include only those that ended in the year 2022.
    *   `.CALCULATE(derived_ins_type = patient.ins_type)` creates a new temporary field `derived_ins_type` for each treatment, which holds the insurance type of the patient associated with that treatment. This field is necessary for partitioning in the next step.

2.  `partitioned_by_insurance`: This takes the previously prepared `treatments_in_2022_with_ins_type` collection.
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""insurance_group"", by=(derived_ins_type))` groups the treatments based on the `derived_ins_type`. Each group (partition) will contain all treatments associated with a specific insurance type.

3.  `insurance_type_metrics`: This operates on the `partitioned_by_insurance` data.
    *   `.CALCULATE(...)` computes aggregate values for each insurance type group:
        *   `insurance_type = derived_ins_type`:  This selects the insurance type (which was the partition key) for the output, renaming it to `insurance_type`.
        *   `avg_pasi_score_d100 = AVG(Treatments.outcome_records.day100_pasi_score)`: This calculates the average `day100_pasi_score`. The `AVG` function operates on all `day100_pasi_score` values found in the `outcome_records` of the treatments belonging to the current insurance type group.
        *   `num_distinct_patients = NDISTINCT(Treatments.patient.patient_id)`: This counts the number of unique patient IDs among the treatments in the current insurance type group.

4.  `top_5_insurance_types_by_pasi`: This takes the `insurance_type_metrics`.
    *   `.TOP_K(5, by=avg_pasi_score_d100.ASC())` sorts these aggregated results by `avg_pasi_score_d100` in ascending order (lowest score first) and selects the top 5 records.

5.  `result = top_5_insurance_types_by_pasi`: The final result, containing the top 5 insurance types with their average day 100 PASI scores and distinct patient counts, is assigned to the `result` variable.",68.54081106185913,"# Step 1: Filter treatments that ended in 2022 and make patient's insurance type available for partitioning.

    *   The diagnosis name (`diag_name`).
    *   The maximum `day100_itch_vas` score from its associated treatments and their outcome records. This is achieved using `MAX(treatments_for.outcome_records.day100_itch_vas)`.
    *   The number of distinct patients treated for this diagnosis. This is calculated using `NDISTINCT(treatments_for.patient.patient_id)`.
3.  Use `TOP_K(3, by=calculated_max_itch_score.DESC(na_pos='last'))` to select the top 3 diagnoses. The primary sorting criterion will be the maximum itch score in descending order. Diagnoses for which this score is not available (null) will be ranked last.
4.  Finally, select and rename the fields as requested: `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score`.

```
Explanation:
- The query starts by accessing the `Diagnoses` collection.
- In the first `CALCULATE` step, we compute three values for each diagnosis:
    - `diagnosis_name_val`: The name of the diagnosis, taken directly from the `diag_name` field.
    - `max_itch_score_val`: The highest `day100_itch_vas` score recorded across all outcome records associated with treatments for that particular diagnosis. This is found by navigating `treatments_for` (plural relationship to `Treatments`), then `outcome_records` (plural relationship from `Treatments` to `Outcomes`), and applying the `MAX` aggregation function to the `day100_itch_vas` field.
    - `num_distinct_patients_val`: The count of unique patients who have received treatment for the diagnosis. This is determined by navigating `treatments_for`, then to the linked `patient` (singular relationship from `Treatments` to `Patients`), and using `NDISTINCT` on their `patient_id`.
- The `TOP_K(3, by=max_itch_score_val.DESC(na_pos='last'))` function then filters these results to keep only the top 3 diagnoses. The ranking is based on `max_itch_score_val` in descending order (highest score first). The `na_pos='last'` argument ensures that any diagnoses without a `day100_itch_vas` score (resulting in a null `max_itch_score_val`) are placed at the end of the ranking and are less likely to be included in the top 3.
- Finally, the second `CALCULATE` step selects these three computed values and renames them to `diagnosis_name`, `number_of_patients`, and `maximum_itch_score` as requested for the output.",51.26544165611267,"result = Diagnoses.CALCULATE(

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Patients.PARTITION(name=""insurance_groups"", by=(ins_type))`**:
    *   We start with the `Patients` collection.
    *   We then `PARTITION` the patients into groups based on their `ins_type`. Each group will represent a unique insurance type.

2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   For each `insurance_groups` (i.e., for each unique insurance type):
        *   `insurance_type=ins_type`: We select the `ins_type` and rename it to `insurance_type` for clarity in the output.
        *   `avg_height_cm=AVG(Patients.height_cm)`: We calculate the average `height_cm` for all patients within that specific insurance type group.
        *   `avg_weight_kg=AVG(Patients.weight_kg)`: Similarly, we calculate the average `weight_kg` for patients within that insurance type group.

3.  **`.TOP_K(3, by=avg_height_cm.DESC())`**:
    *   After calculating the average height and weight for each insurance type, we use `TOP_K` to select the top 3.
    *   `3`: Specifies that we want the top 3 records.

1.  Start with the `Drugs` collection.
2.  For each drug, calculate:

**Explanation:**

1.  `Drugs.CALCULATE(...)`: This step processes each drug in the `Drugs` collection.
    *   `drug_name_val=drug_name`: Stores the drug's name.
    *   `num_treatments_val=COUNT(treatments_used_in)`: Counts the number of treatments associated with each drug. `treatments_used_in` is a sub-collection linking drugs to treatments.

How many treatments for diagnoses containing 'psoriasis' (match with wildcards case-insensitively) involve drugs that have been FDA-approved and the treatments have ended within the last 6 months from today?,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM treatments t JOIN diagnoses d ON t.diag_id = d.diag_id JOIN drugs dr ON t.drug_id = dr.drug_id WHERE d.diag_name LIKE '%psoriasis%' AND dr.fda_appr_dt IS NOT NULL AND t.end_dt >= DATE('now', '-6 months');",DermTreatment,"The user wants to count treatments based on three main criteria:
1.  The associated diagnosis name contains ""psoriasis"" (case-insensitively, with wildcards).
2.  The drug used in the treatment has an FDA approval date (implying it's FDA-approved).
3.  The treatment's end date is within the last 6 months from the current date and the treatment has indeed ended.

We can achieve this by:
1.  Starting with the `Treatments` collection.
2.  Filtering these treatments using a `WHERE` clause that combines all conditions:
    *   For the diagnosis: `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`. We use `UPPER` to ensure case-insensitivity and `%` for wildcard matching.
    *   For FDA approval: `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`, which checks if the `fda_appr_dt` field (FDA approval date) exists for the drug associated with the treatment.
    *   For the end date:
        *   The treatment must have an end date: `HAS(end_dt) == 1`.
        *   The end date must be on or before today: `end_dt <= DATETIME('now')`.
        *   The end date must be on or after 6 months ago from today: `end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')`.
3.  Counting the number of treatments that satisfy all these conditions. This count will be a single value, so we'll use `DermTreatment.CALCULATE` to present it.

```python
# Filter treatments based on the specified criteria
filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(
    (LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')) &  # Diagnosis name contains 'psoriasis' (case-insensitive)
    (HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1) &                       # Drug has an FDA approval date
    (HAS(end_dt) == 1) &                                 # Treatment has an end date
    (end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months')) &           # End date is within the last 6 months
    (end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))                          # Treatment has ended (end date is not in the future)
)

# Calculate the total count of such treatments
result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(
    num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments)
)
```
**Explanation:**

1.  `filtered_treatments = Treatments.WHERE(...)`: We start by selecting from the `Treatments` collection and applying a series of filters.
    *   `LIKE(UPPER(diagnosis.diag_name), '%PSORIASIS%')`: This condition checks if the `diag_name` of the `diagnosis` associated with the treatment contains ""psoriasis"". `UPPER` is used on `diag_name` and the pattern is in uppercase to ensure case-insensitive matching. The `%` are wildcards.
    *   `HAS(drug.fda_appr_dt) == 1`: This ensures that the `drug` used in the treatment has an `fda_appr_dt` (FDA approval date), implying it's FDA-approved.
    *   `HAS(end_dt) == 1`: This ensures the treatment has an actual end date recorded.
    *   `(end_dt >= DATETIME('now', '-6 months'))`: This condition checks if the treatment's `end_dt` is on or after the date 6 months ago from the current time. `DATETIME('now', '-6 months')` calculates this past date.
    *   `(end_dt <= DATETIME('now'))`: This condition ensures the treatment `end_dt` is not in the future, meaning the treatment has indeed ended by today.
    *   All these conditions are combined with the logical `&` (AND) operator, so a treatment must satisfy all of them.

2.  `result = DermTreatment.CALCULATE(num_qualifying_treatments = COUNT(filtered_treatments))`:
    *   After filtering, `filtered_treatments` contains all treatments meeting the criteria.
    *   `COUNT(filtered_treatments)` counts the number of records in this filtered collection.

    *   Using `SINGULAR()` to ensure we are referencing a single treatment record, as `CALCULATE` expects singular values.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Treatments.WHERE(is_placebo == True)`**:
    *   Starts by filtering the `Treatments` collection to include only those records where `is_placebo` is true.

2.  **First `.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   `treatment_id_val = treatment_id`: Stores the `treatment_id` of the placebo treatment.
    *   `current_treatment_start_dt = start_dt`: Stores the `start_dt` (start date) of the placebo treatment. This is crucial for use in the sub-query for `concomitant_meds`.
    *   `treatment_end_dt_val = end_dt`: Stores the `end_dt` (end date) of the placebo treatment.
    *   `qualifying_concomitant_meds = concomitant_meds.WHERE(...)`: This processes the `concomitant_meds` sub-collection for each placebo treatment.
        *   The `WHERE` clause filters these concomitant medications:
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", current_treatment_start_dt, start_dt) >= 0`: Ensures the concomitant medication started on or after the treatment's start date. `current_treatment_start_dt` refers to the parent treatment's start date, and the second `start_dt` refers to the concomitant medication's start date.
            *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", current_treatment_start_dt, start_dt) <= 14`: Ensures the concomitant medication started no more than 14 days (2 weeks) after the treatment's start date.
        *   The nested `.CALCULATE(...)` then selects the required fields for these filtered concomitant medications:
            *   `con_med_start_dt = start_dt`: The start date of the concomitant medication.
            *   `con_med_end_dt = end_dt`: The end date of the concomitant medication.

3.  **`.WHERE(HAS(qualifying_concomitant_meds) == 1)`**:
    *   After calculating `qualifying_concomitant_meds` for each placebo treatment, this filters out any treatments that do not have at least one concomitant medication meeting the specified date criteria.

4.  **Second `.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    *   This final `CALCULATE` shapes the output to include only the requested fields with clear names:
        *   `treatment_id = treatment_id_val`: The ID of the placebo treatment.
        *   `treatment_start_date = current_treatment_start_dt`: The start date of the placebo treatment.
        *   `treatment_end_date = treatment_end_dt_val`: The end date of the placebo treatment.
        *   `concomitant_med_details = qualifying_concomitant_meds`: A list containing the details (start and end dates) of all concomitant medications that met the criteria for that treatment.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  For each merchant, calculate two intermediate values:
    *   `distinct_coupons_count`: The number of distinct coupons used in successful transactions. This is found by filtering the merchant's `transactions_received` for those with `status == ""completed""` and where a coupon was used (`HAS(coupon) == 1`), then counting the distinct `coupon.cid`.
    *   `distinct_transactions_count`: The number of distinct successful transactions. This is found by filtering the merchant's `transactions_received` for those with `status == ""completed""`, then counting the distinct `txid`.
3.  In a subsequent `CALCULATE` step, compute the `CPUR` by dividing `distinct_coupons_count` by `distinct_transactions_count`.
4.  Use the `IFF` function to handle cases where `distinct_transactions_count` is zero (to prevent division by zero), defaulting `CPUR` to `0.0` in such instances.
5.  The final result will include the merchant's name (`name`) and the calculated `CPUR`.

        *   Accesses `transactions_received` for each merchant.
        *   Filters these transactions using `WHERE((status == ""completed"") & (HAS(coupon) == 1))`. This keeps only transactions that are ""completed"" (assumed successful) AND have an associated coupon.

**Explanation:**

1.  `current_week_context`: We start by calculating `current_week_start_ts` (the timestamp for the beginning of the current week) at the `Ewallet` (graph) level. This provides a stable reference for date calculations.
2.  `notifications_with_week_info`:
    *   We access `Users` and filter for those in the ""US"" or ""CA"".
    *   Then, we access their `notifications`.
    *   For each notification, we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `notification_actual_week_start`: The start date of the week the notification was created, effectively truncating `created_at` to the week.
        *   `is_weekend_notification_flag`: A flag (1 if true, 0 if false) indicating if the notification was sent on a Saturday or Sunday, determined using `DAYNAME()`.
        *   `num_weeks_ago`: The difference in full weeks between the notification's week and the `current_week_start_ts`.
3.  `relevant_notifications_for_period`: We filter the above results to keep only notifications where `num_weeks_ago` is 1, 2, or 3. This selects notifications from the three full weeks immediately preceding the current week.
4.  `weekly_notification_summary` (assigned to `result`):
    *   We `PARTITION` the `relevant_notifications_for_period` by `notification_actual_week_start`. This groups notifications by the week they were sent.
    *   Within each group (i.e., for each week), we `CALCULATE`:
        *   `week_start_date`: The start date of the week for which the counts are being reported.
        *   `total_notifications_count`: The total number of notifications sent in that week (achieved by `COUNT(Notifications)` within the partition group).
        *   `weekend_notifications_count`: The number of notifications sent on a weekend during that week (achieved by `SUM(is_weekend_notification_flag)` over the items in the partition group).

**Explanation:**

1.  **`Merchants.WHERE(...)`**: We start by accessing the `Merchants` collection and applying filters.
    *   **`(LOWER(category) == ""retail"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose category is 'retail'. `LOWER(category)` converts the merchant's category to lowercase, ensuring a case-insensitive match with ""retail"".
    *   **`(status == ""active"")`**: This condition filters for merchants whose status is 'active'.
    *   **`(HAS(coupons) == 1)`**: This condition ensures that we only consider merchants who have issued at least one coupon. The `HAS(coupons)` function checks if the `coupons` sub-collection (which is a list of coupons associated with the merchant) is not empty.
2.  **`.CALCULATE(...)`**: After filtering, we use `CALCULATE` to select and compute the desired output fields:
    *   **`merchant_name=name`**: This selects the `name` of the merchant and renames it to `merchant_name` in the output.
    *   **`total_coupons_issued=COUNT(coupons)`**: This counts the number of coupons associated with each filtered merchant using the `COUNT(coupons)` aggregation function and names this field `total_coupons_issued`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **`us_based_users = Users.WHERE(country == ""US"")`**:
    This line filters the `Users` collection to select only users whose `country` attribute is ""US"".

2.  **`transactions_from_us_users = us_based_users.transactions_sent`**:
    From the filtered US-based users, this line accesses their sent transactions via the `transactions_sent` sub-collection. It's assumed that ""transactions made by users"" refers to transactions they initiated or sent.

3.  **`recent_transactions_from_us_users = transactions_from_us_users.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now')) <= 6)`**:
    This line filters the `transactions_from_us_users` to include only those that occurred within the last 7 days, inclusive of the current day.
    *   `DATETIME('now')` gets the current date and time.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", created_at, DATETIME('now'))` calculates the number of full days between the transaction's `created_at` date and the current date.
    *   The condition `<= 6` ensures that transactions from today (0 days difference) up to 6 full days prior are included, covering a 7-day period.

4.  **`result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`**:
    This line performs the final aggregation at the `Ewallet` (top graph) level.
    *   **`num_transactions = COUNT(recent_transactions_from_us_users)`**: This calculates the total number of transactions that meet the specified criteria (US users, sent transactions, last 7 days).
    *   **`total_transaction_amount = SUM(recent_transactions_from_us_users.amount)`**: This calculates the sum of the `amount` for all these filtered transactions.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, access their `balances` (which are `UserBalances` records).
3.  Within each user's set of balances, identify the most recent one. This can be done by ranking the balances based on the `updated_at` field in descending order. The balance record with rank 1 will be the latest.
4.  Extract the `balance` amount from this latest record.
5.  The final result should include the user's identifier (`uid`) and their LUB.

We will use the `RANKING` window function to find the latest balance entry for each user, and then `SINGULAR()` to extract the balance value from that single entry.

**Explanation:**

1.  `Users.CALCULATE(...)`: We iterate through each user in the `Users` collection to calculate new fields.
2.  `user_identifier=uid`: For each user, we select their `uid` and name it `user_identifier`.
3.  `latest_user_balance_value=...`: We define a new field `latest_user_balance_value`.
    *   `balances`: This accesses the list of `UserBalances` associated with the current user.
    *   `.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1)`:

        *   `== 1`: We filter these ranked balances to keep only the one(s) with rank 1 (i.e., the most recent).
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: Since we expect only one ""most recent"" balance per user (or `RANKING` will pick one if ties exist with default `allow_ties=False`), `SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of the `WHERE` clause as a single record.
    *   `.balance`: From this single, most recent balance record, we extract the `balance` field. If a user has no balances, this expression will likely result in `null` for `latest_user_balance_value`.",29.24884915351868,"user_latest_balances = Users.CALCULATE(

1.  `latest_setting_snapshot_for_user = Users.setting_snapshots.WHERE(RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1).SINGULAR()`:
    *   We start by accessing the `setting_snapshots` for each user (`Users.setting_snapshots`).
    *   `RANKING(by=snapshot_date.DESC(), per=""Users"") == 1`: This ranks the snapshots for each user (`per=""Users""`) based on their `snapshot_date` in descending order. We then filter to keep only the snapshot with rank 1, which is the latest one.
    *   `.SINGULAR()`: This function is used because, after filtering by rank, we expect at most one snapshot per user (the latest one). It allows us to treat this sub-collection record as a singular item in the subsequent `CALCULATE` step.

2.  `result = Users.CALCULATE(user_id=uid, opt_in_preference=latest_setting_snapshot_for_user.marketing_opt_in)`:

1.  **Determine the Date Range**: We need to identify transactions that occurred from the start of the month, two months prior to the current month, up to the start of the current month (exclusive). For example, if the current date is in July, we'll consider transactions from May 1st up to (but not including) July 1st.
2.  **Filter Transactions**: Select transactions that fall within this calculated date range and have a `sender_type` of 0, as per the PMDAU definition.
3.  **Extract Temporal Information**: For each relevant transaction, extract the year and month from its `created_at` timestamp. This is necessary for monthly aggregation. We also carry forward the `sender_id` for the distinct count.
4.  **Group and Aggregate**: Partition the filtered transactions by year and month. For each year-month group, calculate the PMDAU by counting the number of distinct `sender_id`s.
5.  **Order Results**: Finally, order the results by year and month for clarity.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Define the date boundaries for the query:
# 'two_months_ago_start_date' is the beginning of the month that was two months ago (e.g., if today is July 15th, this will be May 1st).

```

**Explanation:**

1.  `two_months_ago_start_date` and `current_month_start_date` are contextless expressions defining the time window. `DATETIME('now', 'start of month', '-2 months')` calculates the date for the start of the month that was two full months prior to the current month.
2.  `Transactions.WHERE(...)` filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions that occurred within the specified date range and were initiated by a sender of `sender_type = 0`.
3.  The first `CALCULATE` call on `relevant_transactions_for_pmdau` creates a new collection `transactions_with_month_info`. For each transaction, it adds `transaction_year` and `transaction_month` (extracted from `created_at`) and includes `sender_id` under the new name `sender_id_val`. This prepares the data for monthly aggregation.
4.  `PARTITION(name=""monthly_active_users_group"", by=(transaction_year, transaction_month))` groups the `transactions_with_month_info` data by unique combinations of `transaction_year` and `transaction_month`.
5.  The subsequent `CALCULATE` operates on these monthly groups. It outputs `year_of_transaction` and `month_of_transaction` (which are the partitioning keys) and `pmdau`. The `pmdau` is calculated using `NDISTINCT(sender_id_val)`, which counts the unique sender IDs within each monthly group, fulfilling the PMDAU definition.

1.  Filter the `UserSessions` collection to include only sessions that started on or after `2023-06-01T00:00:00` and before `2023-06-08T00:00:00`.
2.  For each of these filtered sessions, calculate its duration in seconds using `DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`. We also need to retain the `user_id` for grouping.

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration`: This variable holds sessions that fall within the specified date range (`2023-06-01` inclusive to `2023-06-08` exclusive). For each such session, it calculates `calculated_duration_seconds` (the duration of that single session in seconds) and keeps `session_user_id` (the `user_id` associated with the session).
2.  `user_total_session_durations`: This takes `sessions_with_duration` and groups them by `session_user_id` using `PARTITION`. For each group (i.e., for each unique user), it calculates:
    *   `user_id_output`: This is the `user_id` for the group.
    *   `total_duration_output`: This is the sum of `calculated_duration_seconds` for all sessions belonging to that user within the filtered range. The `UserSessions.calculated_duration_seconds` refers to the `calculated_duration_seconds` field of the records within each partition group, which originated from the `UserSessions` collection.

1.  **Define ""Previous Month""**: We'll calculate the start and end dates for the previous month based on the current date. The previous month starts on the first day of the month preceding the current month and ends on the last day of that same month (or, equivalently, just before the first day of the current month).
2.  **Filter Transactions**: We'll select all transactions from the `Transactions` collection that fall within this calculated ""previous month"" period using their `created_at` timestamp.
3.  **Identify Successful Transactions**: We'll assume a transaction is ""successful"" if its `status` field is equal to `""completed""`. This is a common convention, but if a different status indicates success, this condition should be adjusted.
4.  **Count Transactions**:
    *   Count the total number of transactions that occurred in the previous month.
    *   Count the number of successful transactions (as defined above) within that same period.
5.  **Calculate STR**: The STR is calculated as `(number of successful transactions / total number of transactions)`. We'll ensure this is a floating-point division and handle the case where there are no transactions in the previous month to avoid division by zero (in which case, STR will be 0.0).

We will use contextless expressions to define the date boundaries and the initial filtered set of transactions for clarity. The final result will be a single value representing the STR for the previous month.

**Explanation:**

1.  `_prev_month_start_boundary`: This contextless expression calculates the first moment of the month immediately preceding the current month. For example, if today is July 15th, this will be June 1st, 00:00:00.
2.  `_current_month_start_boundary`: This calculates the first moment of the current month (e.g., July 1st, 00:00:00). This serves as the exclusive upper bound for the ""previous month"" period.
3.  `_transactions_in_prev_month`: This filters the `Transactions` collection to include only those transactions whose `created_at` timestamp falls on or after `_prev_month_start_boundary` and before `_current_month_start_boundary`.
4.  The first `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `num_successful_tx_prev_month`: Counts transactions from `_transactions_in_prev_month` where the `status` is `""completed""`.
    *   `num_total_tx_prev_month`: Counts all transactions in `_transactions_in_prev_month`.
5.  The second `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `str_value`: Computes the Success Transaction Rate. It uses `IFF` to check if `num_total_tx_prev_month` is greater than zero to prevent division by zero. If there are transactions, it calculates the ratio; otherwise, it defaults to `0.0`. The `1.0 *` ensures the division results in a float.
6.  The final `Ewallet.CALCULATE`:
    *   `previous_month_str = str_value`: This selects only the calculated STR, renaming it to `previous_month_str` for the final output, ensuring the result contains just this single requested value.

**Explanation:**

1.  `merchants_with_creation_date_parts = Merchants.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step starts with the `Merchants` collection.
    *   It calculates `merchant_creation_year_field` (the year the merchant was created) and `merchant_creation_month_field` (the month the merchant was created) for each merchant.
    *   It also carries forward the merchant's `mid` and `name` under temporary names (`merchant_id_temp`, `merchant_name_temp`).

2.  `merchants_with_coupon_counts = merchants_with_creation_date_parts.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This step takes the records from the previous step.
    *   For each merchant, it calculates `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. This is done by:
        *   Accessing the `coupons` sub-collection for that merchant.
        *   Filtering these coupons using a `WHERE` clause:
            *   `YEAR(created_at) == merchant_creation_year_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation year matches the merchant's creation year.
            *   `MONTH(created_at) == merchant_creation_month_field`: Checks if the coupon's creation month matches the merchant's creation month.
        *   `COUNT(...)` then counts how many coupons satisfy this condition.
    *   The merchant's ID and name are passed through as `merchant_mid_val` and `merchant_name_val`.

3.  `top_merchant_details = merchants_with_coupon_counts.TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())`:
    *   This step takes the merchants along with their respective counts of coupons created in their creation month.
    *   `TOP_K(1, by=num_coupons_in_creation_month.DESC())` selects the single merchant who has the highest `num_coupons_in_creation_month`. If there's a tie, one of the top merchants will be chosen.

4.  `result = top_merchant_details.CALCULATE(...)`:

We will only consider successful transactions and exclude merchants as senders. The result should show the month (formatted as YYYY-MM) and the count of these users, ordered by month.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Prepare Transaction Data**:
    *   It starts with the `Transactions` collection.
    *   It filters transactions to include only those that occurred in the year 2023 (`YEAR(created_at) == 2023`).
    *   It ensures the `sender_type` is ""user"", meaning the sender was a user and not a merchant.
    *   It filters for `status == ""successful""` transactions.
    *   Crucially, it checks if the `sending_user` (the user who sent the money) has a `status` of ""active"" by accessing the linked `Users` record (`sending_user.status == ""active""`).
    *   For these filtered transactions, it calculates:
        *   `year_month_key`: A string representing the year and month of the transaction (e.g., ""2023-01""), using `JOIN_STRINGS` and `LPAD` for consistent month formatting.
        *   `user_sender_id`: The `sender_id` of the user who made the transaction.

2.  **Group by Month and Count Distinct Users**:
    *   The prepared transaction data (`transactions_filtered_info`) is then partitioned by the `year_month_key`. This groups all transactions by the month in which they occurred.
    *   For each monthly group, it calculates:
        *   `month_date`: This is the `year_month_key` (the month string).
        *   `num_distinct_users`: The number of distinct `user_sender_id` values within that month's group, using the `NDISTINCT` aggregation function. This gives the count of unique active users who sent money in that month.

3.  **Order Results**:
    *   Finally, the results are ordered by `month_date` in ascending order, presenting the data from the earliest month in 2023 onwards.

"Which are the top 5 countries by total transaction amount sent by users, sender_type = 0? Return the country, number of distinct users who sent, and total transaction amount.","SELECT u.country, COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS user_count, SUM(t.amount) AS total_amount FROM users AS u JOIN wallet_transactions_daily AS t ON u.uid = t.sender_id WHERE t.sender_type = 0 GROUP BY u.country ORDER BY CASE WHEN total_amount IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END DESC, total_amount DESC LIMIT 5;",Ewallet,"The query aims to identify the top 5 countries based on the total transaction amount sent by users, where the `sender_type` is 0. For these countries, we need to return the country name, the count of distinct users who sent transactions from that country, and the total transaction amount.

Here's how the PyDough code achieves this:

1.  **Filter and Detail User Transactions**:
    *   It starts by filtering the `Transactions` collection to include only those where `sender_type == 0`, indicating the sender is a user.
    *   For these filtered transactions, it uses `CALCULATE` to extract:
        *   `transaction_amount`: The `amount` of the transaction.
        *   `origin_country`: The `country` of the `sending_user`.
        *   `sending_user_id`: The `uid` of the `sending_user`, which will be used to count distinct users.
    *   This step results in a collection (`user_transactions_details`) where each row represents a user-sent transaction with its amount and the sender's country and ID.

2.  **Group Transactions by Country**:
    *   The `user_transactions_details` collection is then partitioned by `origin_country` using `PARTITION`. This groups all transactions based on the country of the sending user.

3.  **Calculate Aggregates per Country**:
    *   For each country group created by the partition, `CALCULATE` is used to compute the required aggregates:
        *   `country`: The name of the country (from `origin_country`).
        *   `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent`: The count of unique `sending_user_id` values within that country's transaction group, obtained using `NDISTINCT`.
        *   `total_transaction_amount`: The sum of all `transaction_amount` values for transactions originating from that country, obtained using `SUM`.

4.  **Identify Top 5 Countries**:
    *   The `country_level_summary` (which contains the aggregated data per country) is then processed by `TOP_K(5, by=total_transaction_amount.DESC())`. This selects the top 5 countries, ordered in descending order by their `total_transaction_amount`.

5.  **Final Result**:
    *   The `result` variable holds the final table, which includes the `country`, `number_of_distinct_users_who_sent`, and `total_transaction_amount` for the top 5 countries.

1.  **Filter Merchants**: We start by selecting merchants from the `Merchants` collection. We filter them based on three conditions:
    *   Their `status` must be ""active"".
    *   Their `category` must contain the string ""retail"". We use `LOWER()` on the category and search for ""retail"" to ensure case-insensitivity.
    *   They must have at least one balance record. We use `HAS(balances) == 1` for this.

2.  **Determine the Latest Balance for Each Filtered Merchant**: For each merchant that meets the above criteria, we need to find their most recent wallet balance.
    *   Each merchant has a `balances` sub-collection (which are `MerchantBalances` records). Each record in this sub-collection has a `balance` amount and an `updated_at` timestamp.
    *   To find the latest balance, we use the `RANKING` window function on the `balances` sub-collection for each merchant. We rank these balance records by `updated_at` in descending order. The `per=""Merchants""` argument ensures this ranking is performed independently for each merchant.
    *   We select the balance record where the rank is 1 (i.e., the most recent). `allow_ties=False` is the default, ensuring a single top record even if timestamps are identical (though this is unlikely for timestamps).
    *   `SINGULAR()` is used to treat the result of the `WHERE(RANKING(...) == 1)` clause as a single record, from which we extract the `balance` value.
    *   This latest balance is stored in a new calculated field, let's call it `current_merchant_balance`. This step results in a new collection (`merchants_with_latest_balance`) where each record represents a filtered merchant and includes their `current_merchant_balance`.

3.  **Calculate the Median Balance**: Finally, we calculate the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values obtained in the previous step.
    *   The `MEDIAN()` aggregation function is used on the `current_merchant_balance` attribute of the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection.
    *   This calculation is performed at the `Ewallet` (graph) level to produce a single output value representing the overall median.

**Explanation:**

1.  `active_retail_merchants_with_balances`: This line filters the `Merchants` collection. It keeps only those merchants who are `active`, whose `category` (converted to lowercase) `CONTAINS` ""retail"", and who have at least one entry in their `balances` sub-collection (`HAS(balances) == 1`).
2.  `merchants_with_latest_balance`: This line takes the previously filtered merchants and, for each one, calculates a new field `current_merchant_balance`.
    *   `balances.WHERE(RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"") == 1)`: This part processes the `balances` sub-collection of each merchant. `RANKING(by=updated_at.DESC(), per=""Merchants"")` assigns a rank to each balance entry based on its `updated_at` timestamp in descending order (most recent first). The ranking is done `per=""Merchants""`, meaning it's reset for each merchant. We then filter for the entry with rank 1.
    *   `.SINGULAR().balance`: Since `RANKING(...) == 1` should identify a single latest balance entry per merchant, `SINGULAR()` converts this to a single record context, and `.balance` extracts the actual balance amount.
3.  `result = Ewallet.CALCULATE(...)`: This final step calculates the overall median.
    *   `MEDIAN(merchants_with_latest_balance.current_merchant_balance)`: This computes the median of all the `current_merchant_balance` values collected from the `merchants_with_latest_balance` collection. If any merchant had no balances (though filtered out by `HAS(balances)`), or if the `current_merchant_balance` ended up null for any reason, `MEDIAN` would ignore these null values.
    *   The result is stored in a field named `median_wallet_balance` within a single-row collection derived from `Ewallet` (the top-level graph object).",68.53881692886353,"# Step 1: Filter merchants who are active, in 'retail' category, and have balance records.

what was the average user session duration in seconds split by device_type?,"SELECT device_type, AVG(strftime('%s', session_end_ts) - strftime('%s', session_start_ts)) AS avg_session_duration_seconds FROM user_sessions WHERE session_end_ts IS NOT NULL GROUP BY device_type;",Ewallet,"To determine the average user session duration in seconds, split by device type, we need to perform the following steps:

1.  Access the `UserSessions` collection.
2.  For each session, calculate its duration in seconds. This can be done using the `DATEDIFF` function between `session_end_ts` and `session_start_ts`.
3.  Group the sessions by `device_type` using the `PARTITION` function.
4.  For each `device_type` group, calculate the average of the session durations.

Here's the PyDough code:

```python
# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select the device_type.
# We rename device_type to 'current_device_type' in this intermediate calculation
# to clearly distinguish it as the field we will partition by.
sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(
    current_device_type=device_type,
    duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)

# Then, for each group, calculate the device_type and the average session duration.
result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(
    name=""sessions_by_device_group"",  # Name for the groups created by partition
    by=(current_device_type)         # The key to partition by (from sessions_with_duration)

    device_type=current_device_type, # Output the device type (using the partition key)
    avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds) # Calculate average of the 'duration_seconds' field
)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `sessions_with_duration = UserSessions.CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   This line starts with the `UserSessions` collection.
    *   `CALCULATE` is used to create a new representation of the data.
    *   `current_device_type=device_type`: Selects the `device_type` and assigns it to a new field named `current_device_type`. This is used as the partitioning key.
    *   `duration_seconds=DATEDIFF(""seconds"", session_start_ts, session_end_ts)`: Calculates the difference between `session_start_ts` and `session_end_ts` in seconds for each session and stores it in a new field called `duration_seconds`.

2.  `result = sessions_with_duration.PARTITION(...).CALCULATE(...)`:
    *   `.PARTITION(name=""sessions_by_device_group"", by=(current_device_type))`: This groups the records from `sessions_with_duration` based on unique values of `current_device_type`. Each group is conceptually named `sessions_by_device_group`.
    *   `.CALCULATE(device_type=current_device_type, avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds))`: This operation is performed on each group created by the `PARTITION`.
        *   `device_type=current_device_type`: Includes the `device_type` (which is the partitioning key `current_device_type`) in the final output.
        *   `avg_session_duration_seconds=AVG(sessions_with_duration.duration_seconds)`: Calculates the average of the `duration_seconds` field (which was computed in the first `CALCULATE` step) for all sessions within the current `device_type` group. The `AVG` function will operate on the `duration_seconds` values from the `sessions_with_duration` collection, scoped to the current partition.

The final `result` will contain one record for each `device_type`, showing the `device_type` and its corresponding `avg_session_duration_seconds`.",56.163042068481445,"# Step 1: Calculate the duration of each session in seconds and select the device_type.

1.  Start with the `Merchants` collection.
2.  Filter out merchants who do not have any coupons using `WHERE(HAS(coupons) == 1)`.
3.  For the remaining merchants, use a `CALCULATE` operation to determine:
    *   The merchant's ID (`mid`) as `temp_merchant_id`.
    *   The merchant's registration date (`created_at`) as `temp_registration_date`.
    *   The ID (`cid`) of their earliest coupon as `temp_earliest_coupon_cid`. This is found by taking the merchant's `coupons`, selecting the top 1 ordered by `start_date` in ascending order (`TOP_K(1, by=start_date.ASC())`), making it a singular record (`SINGULAR()`), and then accessing its `cid`.
    *   The start date (`start_date`) of their earliest coupon as `temp_earliest_coupon_start_date`, using a similar approach.
4.  Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter these records further. The condition ensures that the `temp_earliest_coupon_start_date` is:
    *   Greater than or equal to the `temp_registration_date`.
    *   Less than or equal to one year after the `temp_registration_date`. The date one year later is calculated using `DATETIME(temp_registration_date, '1 year')`.
5.  Finally, use another `CALCULATE` operation to select the required fields and assign them their final names: `merchant_id`, `registration_date`, `earliest_coupon_id`, and `earliest_coupon_start_date`.

1.  Start with the `Users` collection.
2.  For each user, we need to check their `notifications` sub-collection.
3.  We are interested in notifications that occurred within 365 days of the user's signup date (`Users.created_at`). We can filter these ""early"" notifications using `notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365)`.
    *   In this `DATEDIFF` function, the first `created_at` (`Users.created_at`) refers to the signup date of the current user being processed.
    *   The second `created_at` refers to the `created_at` field of the `notifications`.
4.  A user should be selected if they have no such ""early"" notifications. This is checked using `HASNOT(...) == 1` on the filtered notifications collection. This condition correctly includes users with no notifications at all, as well as users whose notifications all occurred after their first year.
5.  Finally, for the selected users, we use `CALCULATE` to return their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` date aliased as `signup_date`.

2.  It filters these users using the `WHERE` clause. The condition `HASNOT(notifications.WHERE(DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365)) == 1` checks for users who do not have any notifications within the first 365 days of their signup.
    *   `Users.created_at` refers to the creation date of the user (signup date).
    *   The inner `created_at` refers to the creation date of a notification.
    *   `DATEDIFF(""days"", Users.created_at, created_at) <= 365` identifies notifications that occurred on or before the 365th day after the user signed up.
    *   `HASNOT(...) == 1` ensures that users are selected if the collection of such ""early"" notifications is empty. This covers users with no notifications at all, or users whose notifications all fall outside this first-year window.
3.  For the users who meet this criterion, the `CALCULATE` function selects their `username`, `email`, and their `created_at` field (which is their signup date), renaming it to `signup_date` in the output.",29.18739676475525,"users_without_early_notifications = Users.WHERE(
