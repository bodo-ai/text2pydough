**Task:** Convert natural language descriptions into PyDough code.

**Context:** You are provided with two reference files: 

1. **PyDough Reference File:** This file contains core concepts, functions, and syntax of the PyDough DSL for SQL. Familiarize yourself with the structure, commands, and best practices to ensure accurate code generation.

2. **Database Structure Reference File:** This file outlines the database schema, including tables, fields, data types, and relationships between tables. Understand how to access and manipulate these relations through appropriate PyDough commands.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Format:** You will receive a natural language description that outlines a specific database query or manipulation task. The description may include conditions, specific fields to select, or filters to apply.

2. **Output Format:** Generate a corresponding PyDough code snippet that accurately implements the described task. Ensure that the code adheres to the syntax and structure outlined in the PyDough Reference File.

3. **Code Requirements:**
   - Use clear and concise PyDough syntax.
   - Ensure all fields and tables referenced in the output correspond to those defined in the Database Structure Reference File.
   - Include comments in the generated code to explain the logic behind complex operations, if necessary.

4. **Considerations:**
   - If the input is ambiguous or lacks sufficient detail, return a prompt requesting clarification rather than making assumptions.
   - Ensure that the generated code is free of syntax errors and follows best practices for performance and readability.
