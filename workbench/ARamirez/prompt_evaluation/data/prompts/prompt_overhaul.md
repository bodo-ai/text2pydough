{database_content}

3. **Examples for Context**  
Here are some examples of PyDough code snippets along with their corresponding natural language questions. These examples can help contextualize the task and guide you in understanding the user's requirements.

{similar_queries}

4. **Query definitions**
Here are some definitions that may assist in understanding and answering the query.

[
    "Total Order Value is defined as the sum of extended_price * (1 - discount).",
    "Aggregate Revenue is defined as the sum of LineItem_ExtendedPrice minus the sum of LineItem_Discount.",
    "Average Revenue per Ship Date is defined as the sum of revenue divided by the count of distinct ship dates.",
    "Partial Revenue is defined as quantity * extended_price * (1 - discount).",
    "Profit is defined as revenue minus cost."
]
</context>

<instructions>
To generate the PyDough code snippet, follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the provided natural language description to identify the database query or manipulation required. Extract the main components, such as collections, fields, and operations.

2. Generate PyDough code that:
   - Uses clear and concise syntax, adhering to the correct functions, parameters, and structure outlined in the PyDough Reference File.
   - Avoids the bad examples referenced in the PyDough Reference File.
   - Properly references fields and tables as defined in the Database Structure Reference File.
   - Includes comments for any complex operations, where necessary.
   - Assigns the final query to a variable.
   - Ensures proper indentation.
   - Follows the rules for using contextless expressions properly.
   - Adheres to the syntax and structure outlined in the PyDough Reference File.
   - Compares values using the equality operator (==) when necessary.
   - Ensures variable names are different from the field names in the Database Structure Reference File.
   Hereâ€™s the corrected version:
   - Ensure you start with the appropriate collection.
   - Returns only the exact data requested, without adding additional fields or information.
   - If you need to use the high-level top collection, use the appropriate name as defined in the Database Structure Reference File.
   - Refer to the provided definitions to answer the query when it requires a specific definition. For example, if the query asks for 'total order value,' use the definition provided.

3. Determine if PARTITION is necessary. If it is not required, explore alternative methods such as CALCULATE or aggregations to achieve the desired result. If PARTITION is truly needed, use it appropriately.

4. If the input description contains any ambiguity, respond with a request for clarification regarding the specific details.

5. Enclose the generated PyDough code in a Python code block and ALWAYS provide an explanation of the code, as shown in the examples.

Here's how we analyse and create Pydough queries:

Question: Top 5 States by Average Occupants:
Let's break down the task:

1. For each address, we need to identify how many current occupants it has
2. We need to partition the addresses by the state, and for each state calculate the average occupants
3. We need to select the top 5 states by this average

First, let me think about the relationships in the database:
- `Addresses` contains all addreses.

So to count occupants per all addresses, we need to:
1. Partition the addresses by region and calculate the average of occupants per state
2. Access the `Addresses` collection and count the number of occupants per address
3. Select the top 5

Now let's implement this:
  ``` 
  result= Addresses.PARTITION(name="addrs", by=state).CALCULATE(  
      state=state,  
      avg_occupants=AVG(Addresses.CALCULATE(n_occupants=COUNT(current_occupants)).current_occupants )  
  ).TOP_K(5, by=avg_occupants.DESC())
  ```

Question: Find the customers name who never placed orders.
Let's analyze this request:

We need to find the customers who have never placed orders. This means we need to:
1. Access the `customers` collection
2. Filter for customers who don't have any orders 
3. Return their names

From the database structure reference, we can see that:
- Each customer has an `orders` property which is a list of orders placed by that customer
- We need to check if this list is empty

To do this:
1. We can use the `HASNOT` function to check if a customer has no orders
2. We'll filter the customers using `WHERE(HASNOT(orders)==1)`
3. Then select just their names using `CALCULATE`
Here's the PyDough code I'll generate:

```
customers_without_orders = customers.WHERE(HASNOT(orders)==1).CALCULATE(
    customer_name=name
)
```
This code:
1. Starts with the `customers` collection
2. Filters to only include customers where `HASNOT(orders)==1`, meaning they have no orders
3. Uses `CALCULATE` to return only the customer names

Question: What is the total order value in Brazil in 1992? Total order value is defined as the sum of extended_price * (1 - discount) Return the name and the total order value.
Let's analyze this request:

1. Find the total order value in Brazil in 1992
2. Return the nation name and the total order value

First, I need to understand what "total order value" means. From the provided definitions:
> total order value = sum of extended_price * (1 - discount)

Now, let's think about how to build this query:

1. Start with `nations` and filter for "BRAZIL"
2. From Brazil, access `customers`
3. From customers, access `orders`
4. Filter orders to only include those from 1992
5. From filtered orders, access `lines`
6. Calculate line_value as extended_price * (1 - discount)
7. Sum up these line_values to get the total order value for Brazil in 1992

From the database structure:
- Nations have a name field, so I can filter for "BRAZIL"
- Nations have customers, and customers have orders
- Orders have line items (lines) that have extended_price and discount

Let's create the PyDough code:
```
brazil_total_order_value = nations.WHERE(name == "BRAZIL").CALCULATE(
    nation_name=name,
    total_order_value=SUM(
        customers.orders.WHERE(YEAR(order_date) == 1992).lines.CALCULATE(
            line_value=extended_price * (1 - discount)
        ).line_value
    )
)
```

Question: For each year, identify the priority with the highest percentage of made in that year with that priority, listing the year, priority, and percentage. Sort the results by year.
Let's break down this request:

1. For each year, we need to find the priority with the highest percentage of orders made with that priority in that year.
2. The output should include the year, the priority, and the percentage.
3. We need to sort the results by year.

Here are the detailed steps to solve this:

1. First, we'll group orders by year and priority to get counts.
2. Then, we'll calculate percentages based on yearly totals.
3. For each year, we'll find the priority with the highest percentage.

Let's create the PyDough code:

```
# Step 1: Extract year and priority from orders
order_info = orders.CALCULATE(
    year = YEAR(order_date),
    priority = order_priority
)

# Step 2: Group by year and priority to get counts
year_priority_counts = order_info.PARTITION(name="year_priority", by=(year, priority)).CALCULATE(
    year = year,
    priority = priority,
    n_orders = COUNT(orders)
)

# Step 3: Group by year and calculate percentages for each priority within that year
year_priority_percentages = year_priority_counts.PARTITION(name="year_group", by=year).year_priority.CALCULATE(
            year,
            highest_priority=priority,
            priority_pct=100.0 * n_orders / RELSUM(n_orders, per="year_group"),
        ).WHERE(RANKING(by=priority_pct.DESC(), per="year_group") == 1).ORDER_BY(year.ASC())
```
