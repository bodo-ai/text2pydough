Generate PyDough code based on the provided text description. To accurately perform this task, consider these key aspects:

1. You are provided with two reference files:
   - The first one contains detailed explanations of the core concepts and functions of PyDough. Make sure to understand the available functions, syntax, and paradigms.
   - The second file explains the database structure, including how to access each relation and the relationships between different entities. Pay attention to how data is organized and how to manipulate it using PyDough.

2. When converting text descriptions into code, carefully analyze the description to identify the main actions, entities, and relationships involved.

3. Structure the generated PyDough code clearly, using comments to explain each part where necessary.

4. Ensure that the code adheres to best practices for readability and efficiency in PyDough programming.

5. If the description is unclear or vague, seek clarification or make reasonable assumptions based on the provided reference materials.

1. **PyDough Reference File:** This file contains core concepts, functions, and syntax of the PyDough code. Familiarize yourself with the structure, commands, and best practices to ensure accurate code generation.
